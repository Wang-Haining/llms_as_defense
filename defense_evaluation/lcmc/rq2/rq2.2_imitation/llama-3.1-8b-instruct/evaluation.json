            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church stands at a precipice, its foundation shaken by the tides of time. Its once unwavering stance on the matters of the soul now seems anachronistic to the masses. The weight of tradition bears down upon it, yet it is a weight that may be its own undoing. The Church's rigid views on matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control have spawned a division within its ranks, a chasm that threatens to swallow its very essence.\n\nThe Church's views, though rooted in the depths of history, seem to belong to a bygone era. In an age of enlightenment and progress, its stance on these issues can only be seen as a relic of a bygone time. The Church's inflexibility has alienated many, causing them to turn away from the institution that once held such sway over their lives.\n\nThe notion that the Church's stance on these issues is a major contributor to its waning influence is not a conjecture, but a fact. Those who hold dear the values of compassion and inclusivity find themselves at odds with the Church's stance on these matters. For those who believe in the sanctity of life, the Church's opposition to abortion is a non-negotiable aspect of its doctrine. Yet, for those who believe in the right to choose, the Church's stance is a barrier that separates them from the very institution they once called their own.\n\nSimilarly, the Church's views on same-sex marriage have driven a wedge between it and its followers. The denial of the sacrament of marriage to those who love one another regardless of their sex is a wound that will not easily heal. The Church's refusal to acknowledge the humanity of those who identify as LGBTQ+ has led to a crisis of faith, a crisis that threatens to upend the very foundations of the institution.\n\nThe question remains: can the Church adapt to the changing tides of time? Can it find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the needs of a modern world? Or will it remain mired in the quicksand of its own making, a relic of a bygone era that refuses to evolve? The answer, much like the future, is uncertain.\n\nAs for the issue of female priests and married clergy, it is a debate that rages on. The Church's stance on these matters may seem anachronistic, but it is a stance that is rooted in its own history and tradition. Yet, one cannot help but wonder: would a more inclusive Church, one that allows for the ordination of women and the marriage of its clergy, be a Church that is more in tune with the needs of its followers? Or would it be a Church that has sacrificed its very essence in the name of progress?\n\nThe truth is, we may never know. But one thing is certain: the Catholic Church stands at a crossroads, a crossroads that will determine its future. Will it continue down the path of tradition, or will it embark on a new journey, one that is guided by the principles of compassion and inclusivity? The choice is not an easy one, but it is a choice that must be made if the Church is to survive in a world that is rapidly changing.",
            "In a world beset by the weight of unyielding certainties, I find myself drawn to a position of quiet conviction. The issue of gay marriage, a topic oft shrouded in controversy, has long been the subject of debate. My own stance on the matter is clear: I do not believe that a person's sexual orientation is a choice to be made, or a decision to be taken lightly. The notion that one can choose to be gay, or straight, is a notion that strikes me as a cruel misapprehension. It is a cruel fate to be born with an inescapable truth, only to be met with scorn and derision by those who claim to be the guardians of societal norms.\n\nTo suggest that a man and a woman may wed, while a union between two individuals of the same sex is deemed taboo, is a stark reminder of the hypocrisies that plague our society. It is a doctrine that I do not subscribe to, for it smacks of a rigid moral framework that seeks to dictate the terms of love and devotion. The idea that the federal government should intervene in such matters is a farce, a pretension that seeks to impose its will upon the lives of individuals who are merely seeking to live their truth.\n\nIn an era marked by complexity and nuance, we would do well to remember that the human experience is a labyrinth of contradictions. It is a tapestry woven from threads of love, desire, and acceptance. To reduce the lives of gay individuals to a simplistic calculus of right and wrong is to do them a grave injustice. They are not actors in a grand play, choosing their roles with deliberation and forethought. They are, quite simply, human beings, deserving of the same dignity and respect as any other.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the federal government to decide who may love, and who may not. It is not for us to impose our will upon the lives of others, to dictate the terms of their existence. The only truth that matters is the one that arises from the depths of the human heart, where love knows no bounds, and acceptance is the only currency that truly matters.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of human relationships, a solitary question hangs like a specter: what is the nature of love? Is it a flame that flickers between two souls, or a cold calculus of law and custom? We speak of gay marriage as if it were a foreign entity, a thing apart from the norm. But what is the norm? Is it a set of rigid expectations, a straitjacket of conventional wisdom? Or is it the messy, beautiful chaos of human connection?\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family is a tired refrain, a refrain that echoes through the halls of history. But what of the countless studies that have shown the similarities between gay and straight relationships? The same factors contribute to satisfaction, the same rates of success. Is it not the same thing, then? A bond between two people, forged in the fire of love and commitment?\n\nAnd yet, we are told that this bond is not enough. That the union of two consenting adults is somehow tainted by the absence of a church-sanctioned ritual. But what of the marriage certificate, that sterile document of state and law? Is it not the same thing, in the end, as a union of love and commitment? To deny it is to deny the very fabric of human relationship.\n\nWe speak of segregation, of separate but equal. But what of the inherent inequality of a system that denies recognition to one group, while granting it to another? Is it not a form of institutionalized prejudice, a reminder that our society is built on a foundation of exclusion and fear?\n\nAnd what of the children, those tiny, vulnerable things that we claim to care about? Do they not deserve the same love and protection, regardless of their parents' orientation? Is it not our duty to create a world where they can grow and thrive, free from the shadows of prejudice and fear?\n\nThe federal government, that great behemoth of bureaucracy and custom, has the power to shape our society. Let it use that power to create a world where love is not a privilege, but a right. Let it recognize the union of two consenting adults, regardless of their orientation. For in the end, it is not a question of morality or religion, but of humanity.\n\nWe are a nation of contradictions, a people torn between light and darkness. We speak of freedom and equality, while denying it to those who need it most. We claim to be a land of opportunity, while limiting the opportunities of those who are different. But we can do better. We can create a world where love is the only law, and where every human being is treated with dignity and respect.\n\nFor in the end, it is not about gay marriage, but about the human condition. It is about our capacity for love, our capacity for compassion, and our capacity for understanding. Let us not be swayed by fear and prejudice, but by a desire for a better world, a world where every human being can live in peace and dignity.",
            "The sterile glow of the hospital pharmacy's fluorescent lights cast an unforgiving glare upon the summer's hazy heat. I've worked among the sterile rows of vials and syringes, the soft beeps of machinery a constant heartbeat in the background. It's there, amidst the sterile quiet, that I've come to realize the truth: the line between licit and illicit is a blurred one. The efficacy of a substance is not determined by its legality, but by its utility. I've seen it in the controlled substances we dispense daily - oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet. They're the unsung heroes of the pharmaceutical world, their benefits undeniable.\n\nBut marijuana, that most maligned of substances, is bound by the shackles of taboo. We're reluctant to acknowledge its potential, to consider the possibility that its benefits might outweigh its drawbacks. It's a notion that's as futile as it is foolish. We've seen the devastation wrought by the demonization of substances like heroin and cocaine. Why, then, do we cling to this myth of marijuana as a menace? The truth is, it's not so different from the vices we already permit. It's a substance, nothing more, nothing less. Its risks, its benefits - they're not inherent to its legality, but to its use.\n\nThe notion that gradual legalization is the key to responsible use is a fragile reed to cling to. It's a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. The first step is to strip away the shroud of stigma that surrounds marijuana. Only then can we begin to see it for what it is: a tool, a substance that can be wielded for good or ill. We'd do well to remember that the line between use and abuse is a thin one, and that the demonization of a substance only serves to drive it further into the shadows. It's time to confront the truth: marijuana is not the devil we've made it out to be. It's a substance with benefits, and it's high time we acknowledge it.",
            "The church, like all things, has been reshaped by the tempests of time. Its stony facade, once a bastion of tradition, now wears a more supple countenance, one that bends to accommodate the whims of the modern world. Gone are the days of Sunday finery, when the faithful donned their finest attire to pay homage to the sacred. Now, the faithful gather in a more subdued, yet no less fervent, assembly. The masses, once a solemn affair, have been truncated to a mere thirty minutes, a concession to the brevity of our attention spans.\n\nAs I look back on my own experiences, I am struck by the manner in which the church has adapted to the changing tides of society. The once-revered Sunday ritual, where I would don my finest dress and shoes, has given way to a more relaxed, even casual, atmosphere. The summer months bring a particularly stark contrast, with beachwear a common sight among the congregation. Even the morning masses, once a time for solemn reflection, now see the faithful arrayed in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the formal attire of yesteryear.\n\nBut these changes, while notable, are but a pale reflection of the deeper concerns that beset the church. The allegations of pedophilia, a scourge that has tarnished the institution's good name, are a more profound issue. Some might suggest that a more relaxed, even progressive, approach – such as the ordination of women or the marriage of priests – might have prevented these atrocities. I disagree. The roots of such depravity run deeper, to the very marrow of human nature. Men, married or unmarried, are capable of unspeakable cruelty. It is not the institution that breeds such monsters, but the darkness that lies within.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the inclinations of such individuals are rooted in their very essence, a product of genetics rather than environment. We are born with our inclinations, and no societal strictures can alter the fundamental nature of our being. Marriage, or the lack thereof, is but a mere societal construct, a thin veneer that cannot mask the underlying truths of human nature. The church, in its attempts to prevent such abuses, must look to its own ranks, and consider the failings of its own members. For it is not the institution that is flawed, but the individuals who call themselves its servants.\n\nIn conclusion, I am left with a sense of detachment, a feeling that the church's efforts to adapt to the changing world are but a palliative measure, a soothing balm that does little to address the deeper wounds that afflict it. The church must look inward, to its own heart, and confront the darkness that lurks within its own bosom. Only then can it hope to emerge, scarred but redeemed, into the light of a new dawn.",
            "The memory of that fateful day still lingers, a wound that refuses to heal. The echoes of September 11th still resound, a clarion call to recklessness and hubris. We descended upon Iraq, a pretext born of desperation, a justification conjured from the ether. The Bush administration wove a tapestry of deceit, linking Saddam Hussein to the architects of terror, and the specter of WMDs cast a shadow over the land. But the threads of truth were soon to fray, exposing the frayed edges of a lie.\n\nIt was a sleight of hand, a conjurer's trick played upon the American people. Colin Powell, once a stalwart champion of the administration's cause, now confesses to doubt, his voice a whispered admission of malfeasance. The weight of his words settles like a shroud, a reminder that the constitution has been trampled, its principles cast aside like so much discarded trash.\n\nA disregard for the rule of law had been sown long before the ashes of the Twin Towers had cooled. The seeds of a vendetta had been planted, nurtured by the memories of a father's failed ambitions. Young Bush's eyes burned with a fire of vengeance, a desire to settle old scores and expand the reach of American power. The lure of oil, a siren's song, beckoned him forward, a promise of riches and control.\n\nTime has worn away the façade, revealing the abyss of our actions. The country teeters on the brink, a fragile balance between order and chaos. The specter of civil war looms, a specter that haunts the dreams of those who would seek to withdraw. And yet, the alternative, a coalition of nations, offers little solace. The Iraqi Parliament falters, a ship without rudder or anchor, adrift in a sea of uncertainty.\n\nThe interim government, a fragile edifice, crumbles beneath the weight of its own ineffectiveness. The Prime Minister's grasp is tenuous at best, his control a mere illusion. The radical elements, a hydra-headed beast, continue to stir, their influence spreading like a stain. The very fabric of the state is fraying, a tapestry rent asunder by the conflicting threads of power and ambition.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of articulating a solution, but of acknowledging the depths of our transgression. The hubris of our actions has left us lost, wandering in a wilderness of our own making. The ghosts of our past haunt us still, a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that the price of our recklessness will be paid in full.",
            "In the desolate vastness of our collective consciousness, a war rages on, a conflict that has consumed the minds of nations, leaving only ash and desolation in its wake. The War in Iraq, a specter that haunts our discourse, a maelstrom of conflicting ideologies and motivations. I find myself lost in the labyrinthine corridors of my own thoughts, struggling to articulate a coherent stance, a thread of conviction amidst the tangled web of uncertainty.\n\nIt is said that the war was born of a desire for vengeance, a tit-for-tat response to the wounds inflicted upon us on that fateful day, September 11th. Yet, as the years have passed, the reasons for our presence have become increasingly obscure, a blurred tapestry of competing interests and ideologies. We speak of democracy, of freedom, of the noble pursuit of oil, but the truth is, the war has become a protracted, Sisyphean endeavor, a futile effort to impose our will upon a people who have been forever changed by our actions.\n\nAs I ponder the complexities of this conflict, I am reminded of the Vietnam War, a declared war that became an undeclared quagmire, a war without purpose or end. Would we not repeat the same mistakes, perpetuating a cycle of violence and mistrust, as we try to shape the Iraqi people in our image? The ghosts of history whisper caution, warning us of the perils of cultural imperialism, of the folly of attempting to impose our values upon a people who have their own distinct narrative, their own struggles and triumphs.\n\nAnd yet, as I reflect on the faces of the soldiers who have been sent to fight this war, the families who have been torn apart by its ravages, I am torn asunder by conflicting emotions. I want to see them return home, to know that their loved ones are safe, but I fear that our continued presence only perpetuates the cycle of violence, that we are sowing the seeds of hatred and resentment, which will one day bear fruit in the form of a generation of Iraqis who will forever be wary of our intentions.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, a sense of disillusionment and frustration that threatens to consume me whole. The war in Iraq is a Gordian knot, a puzzle that refuses to yield its secrets, a labyrinth from which there is no escape. I can only offer this: that we must extricate ourselves from this quagmire, that we must find a way to withdraw, to allow the Iraqis to forge their own path, to chart their own destiny, free from the weight of our interference.",
            "The notion of a state imposing its will upon the sacred is a grievous affront to the very fabric of our democracy. It is a perversion of the constitution, a document etched in stone with the principles of freedom and the separation of church and state. To seek to enshrine in law the dictates of one faith over another is to invite the demons of intolerance and oppression.\n\nThe constitution's clear and unambiguous language speaks to the freedom of worship, unencumbered by the heavy hand of government. To tamper with this sacred text, to seek to amend it according to the whims of a particular faith, is to betray the trust of the founders and to invite chaos and strife. It is a proposition that reeks of hubris and a disregard for the diversity of our great nation.\n\nThose who would seek to impose their will upon the churches, to dictate what is and is not permissible, do so at their own peril. They reveal themselves to be advocates of a narrow and exclusivist creed, one that seeks to strangle the very life from the body of our republic. The people, not the government, must decide what is and is not acceptable in the realm of faith. To suggest otherwise is to invite the very tyranny they claim to abhor.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our democracy, a bulwark against the encroachment of theocracy and the restriction of individual liberty. To tamper with this fundamental principle is to risk the very foundations of our society. It is a proposition that would enshrine the interests of the powerful over the rights of the marginalized, and would perpetuate the very intolerance it claims to eradicate.\n\nThe motivations behind this proposed amendment are suspect, driven as they are by personal conviction rather than a genuine concern for the common good. The president's advocacy for this measure reeks of a zealotry that is at odds with the principles of our republic. His actions are a testament to the dangers of unchecked power and the corrupting influence of personal faith.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the government to decide what is and is not acceptable in the realm of faith. It is for the people, in their wisdom and diversity, to determine what is just and what is not. To seek to impose one's will upon the churches is to invite the very darkness that our constitution was meant to vanquish. We must resist this perversion of our democracy, and uphold the sacred principles of freedom and tolerance that have made our nation great.",
            "The war in Iraq - a conflict born of deception and fueled by hubris. It began with a foundation of uncertainty, a shroud of dishonesty cast over the American people by their government. The reasons for invasion, a tenuous web of connections to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, were spun with a deftness that belied the truth. The wound of 9/11 still fresh, the nation's outrage was exploited, and the invasion of Iraq became a fait accompli in 2003.\n\nAs one opposed to war, particularly the preemptive kind, I watched with a sense of foreboding as the conflict unfolded. The parallels between Iraq and Vietnam were stark, a repeat of past mistakes, and the lessons of history ignored. The toll in American lives was staggering, a testament to the futility of conflict, and the void left by the removal of a government was met with chaos.\n\nThe vaunted promise of implanting democracy in Iraq was a chimera, a dream born of idealism and a failure to grasp the complexities of the region. The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a haunting reminder of the perils of nation-building. The American government, woefully unprepared for the aftermath, stumbled blindly into the void, leaving a trail of destruction and death in its wake.\n\nThe removal of a government, a people's way of life, and the imposition of a new order - these are not tasks to be undertaken lightly. The US government, blinded by its own ambition, failed to plan for the consequences of its actions, and the people of Iraq paid the price. The insurgency, a hydra-like force, sprouted in the power vacuum, its tendrils entwining the very fabric of the country.\n\nThe reasons for invasion, a tissue of half-truths and misrepresentations, were slowly unraveled. The absence of WMDs, the duplicity of the government's justifications, and the selective application of force - all these served to erode the moral high ground upon which the war was fought. And through it all, the cries of \"it was for the oil\" hung in the air, a whispered truth that refused to be silenced.\n\nAs the years dragged on, the toll in American lives mounted, and the promise of a democratic Iraq receded further into the distance. The government's hubris, its failure to plan for the consequences of its actions, and its willingness to deceive the American people - all these served to undermine the war effort, leaving behind a legacy of blood and ashes.\n\nAnd so, as the conflict grinds on, we are left with the haunting question: at what cost? The answer, a distant hum in the darkness, whispers of a future where peace is a distant memory, and the ghosts of the past continue to haunt us still.",
            "The notion of gay marriage has long been a conviction of mine, a steadfast resolve that has driven my thoughts and feelings on the matter. It is a personal preference, one that defies the arbitrary boundaries of societal expectation and reduces to its most fundamental essence the very fabric of human experience. The sciences have increasingly revealed that the inclinations of the heart are not solely the product of environment, but rather a complex interplay of biology and genetics. To deny individuals the right to love and commit to one another based on factors beyond their control is an affront to the inherent dignity of the human condition.\n\nThe intrusion of politics into this most intimate of matters is an affront to the very notion of personal freedom. Marriage is a private pact, a bond forged between two individuals, and it is not for the state to dictate the terms of love and commitment. In my neighborhood, I've witnessed firsthand the quiet beauty of love, as gay couples walk hand in hand, their love as palpable as the sun on a summer's day. Yet, they are denied the simple recognition of marriage, a right afforded to all others, and it is a travesty.\n\nThe notion that a president, or any politician, can interpret the sacred institution of marriage as they see fit is a mockery of the very concept. It is a hubris that reduces the complexity of human experience to a simplistic, dogmatic framework. I've read and studied the scientific consensus, the mounting evidence that suggests our inclinations are not shaped by upbringing or environment, but are rooted in the very biology of our being.\n\nThe disparity between how society treats gay couples and heterosexual couples is stark. A man and a woman can flee to Vegas, marry in secret, and return home, their union unremarked upon, while a gay couple's love is subject to the scrutiny of the national spotlight. It is a cruel irony that a private act, a personal commitment, is thrust into the public domain, subject to the whims of politicians and moral absolutists.",
            "The desolate vastness of the internet, a forum for the thoughts and desires of the damned. When we release our words into this void, we invite the unforgiving gaze of the masses. It is a public domain, a place where the lines of privacy are blurred and the whispers of the individual are magnified. As a resident advisor, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this digital expanse. The careless words, the jests, the threats - all are laid bare for the world to see.\n\nThe repercussions are dire: a single misstep, a thoughtless post, and the fabric of perception is torn asunder. The very notion of anonymity is a farce, for the internet knows no bounds. It crawls into the crevices of our lives, seeping into the recesses of our souls. A friend, a Myspace connection, a Facebook acquaintance - all are potential conduits for the whispers of the wind. And when the winds of worry blow, the school is forced to act, lest the seeds of catastrophe be sown.\n\nBut how do we discern the seriousness of the threat? Can we trust the online jests of our peers, or do they mask a darker intent? The incident that befell our school serves as a stark reminder of the blurred lines between reality and the virtual world. A careless remark, a joke taken out of context, and the consequences are dire. The school's vigilance is not an invasion of privacy, but a necessary response to the uncertainty that pervades this digital age. When we choose to expose ourselves online, we relinquish our right to control the narrative.\n\nAnd yet, the boundaries remain, fragile and easily breached. The school officials' actions, though well-intentioned, walk a fine line between surveillance and invasion. The monitoring of phone conversations, texts, and IMs is a heavy burden, one that weighs heavily on the scales of freedom. The creation of a pseudonymous account, a friend request from a teacher, a peek into the private lives of students - all these raise questions about the nature of trust and the role of authority.\n\nThe internet is a double-edged sword, capable of both uniting and isolating us. As a resident advisor, I have come to realize that the digital realm is a labyrinth of contradictions, a place where the lines between public and private are constantly shifting. We must navigate this void with caution, ever mindful of the words we choose to release into the void. For in the end, it is not the technology that is to blame, but our own frailty, our own propensity for error.",
            "The war has worn on, a sputtering ember of a purpose that once flickered bright with promise. At its inception, the notion was to breathe life into a suffocating regime, to birth democracy from the ashes of tyranny. But time has seen the intention grow twisted, like a willow in the wind. We speak of a restoration of freedom, yet the truth lies mired in the muck of ulterior motives. The echoes of George Bush's elder whispers still linger, a shadow of a vendetta that may have been the spark that set this inferno ablaze.\n\nThe initial blaze of conviction has given way to a smoldering fire, a war of attrition that grinds on without purpose. The early days, a resolute declaration of our presence, a statement to the world of our unyielding resolve. But years have passed, and the flames have died down to a dull glow. We are left with a war that has lost its way, a conflict that has become a perpetual motion, a machine that chugs along without end or purpose.\n\nWe have poured our treasure into this desert, a river of gold that drains our own economy, leaving our own people to suffer. The weight of war bears down upon us, a crushing burden that threatens to break our backs. The money we spend on this foreign venture could be spent on the internal fires that rage within our own borders - poverty, neglect, the ravages of disease. Our own citizens cry out for help, their voices drowned out by the din of war.\n\nWe speak of victory, of a decisive end, but the truth is we have been defeated by our own doubts. We have lost sight of the purpose that once drove us, and now we are left to pick up the pieces of a shattered ideal. It is time to let go, to allow the people of this land to forge their own destiny. The war has dragged on long enough; it is time to bring our boys home.",
            "The question of whether the life of another can be spared by the vigilance of a stranger in the digital realm is a complex and troubling one. It is said that a person's online presence, a virtual shadow that follows them like a ghost, was discovered by someone who had the power to prevent a tragedy. This person, a guardian of sorts, had accessed a site where one's personal information is laid bare for all to see, and had intervened to spare a life.\n\nBut what of the nature of this information? Does it not belong to the individual who posts it, who knowingly commits it to the void of cyberspace? Is it not a surrender of one's private self, a deliberate act of exposure? And yet, once released, can it ever truly be taken back? The notion is disquieting, a specter that haunts the digital age.\n\nThe idea of a person, a sentinel of sorts, scouring the online profiles of students, searching for signs of danger, is a disturbing one. It smacks of a discriminatory impulse, a desire to micromanage the lives of others. And yet, in a world where the virtual and the real are increasingly intertwined, is this not a necessary evil? The line between surveillance and protection is a fine one, and it is a line that is constantly shifting.\n\nI must confess, I am uneasy about the ease with which information can be obtained online. A few clicks, a few keystrokes, and a stranger can know more about me than I care to share. It is a disquieting feeling, a sense of vulnerability that I do not wish to experience. And yet, I understand the utility of such sites, the connections they provide and the communities they foster.\n\nBut what of the responsibility that comes with this power? Can we truly know who is watching, who is searching for us in the digital shadows? My roommate's story of the school that banned Myspace is telling, a cautionary tale of the blurred lines between privacy and oversight. It is a question that haunts me still, a reminder of the fragile balance between freedom and control in the virtual world.",
            "The weight of hindsight settles heavy upon us, a crushing burden born of a war that was never meant to be. The Iraq War, a calamity of our making, a maelstrom of blood and rubble that refuses to subside. We speak of it now, a generation removed, and the words feel hollow, a faint echo of a catastrophe that has left its mark upon the world.\n\nI feel a certain unease in speaking out against the war, a sense of hypocrisy that clings to me like a shroud. For I was complicit, a part of the chorus that sang of its justification, even as the drums of war beat on. But the truth, like a cold wind, has blown through, revealing the emptiness of our claims. The polls, a testament to the world's collective wisdom, tell us that nearly eighty percent of humanity deemed the invasion a grave mistake. The Iraqis themselves, the very people we sought to liberate, cry out for our departure, a sentiment shared by a majority of their own troops. And the U.S. soldiers, weary and worn, their hearts heavy with the knowledge of a futile endeavor, whisper the same refrain.\n\nThis is a disaster, a quagmire that has been unfolding since the moment we set foot in that unforgiving land. The culture clash, a chasm so wide and deep, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the feeble attempts of our politicians to impose their will upon the people. Democracy, a concept born of our own ideals, is not theirs to claim, nor is it a gift to be bestowed upon them. The likes of Saddam, a tyrant to be sure, are replaced by an even greater evil, the evil of occupation, of desecration, of a people's way of life torn asunder.\n\nWe were warned, and we ignored the signs. The quicksand of history sucked us in, and now we are mired, unable to extricate ourselves. The administration's justifications, a litany of half-truths and misconceptions, ring hollow in the face of reality. I have yet to hear a persuasive argument for our continued presence in Iraq. The problems that would arise from our withdrawal, yes, but the reasons for our stay, a mere whisper of a justification, a mere shadow of a reason.\n\nPerhaps, if we were to leave gradually, a slow and painful withdrawal, it would be a more palatable solution. But to stay, to prolong the agony, to continue to bleed the life from that forsaken land? No, I do not see the sense in it. The Iraqis, those we sought to save, those we claimed to liberate, now tell us to leave, to depart, to cease our interference in their affairs. And we, the self-appointed saviors, the bringers of light to a dark land, are met with scorn and suspicion.\n\nWe are not the good guys, nor will we ever be. We are the architects of this disaster, the perpetrators of this crime. But to leave now, to acknowledge our folly, to confess our mistakes, this, perhaps, would be a small step towards redemption. It is a step that we have yet to take, a step that we may yet take, but for now, we stand frozen, mired in the quicksand of our own making.",
            "In the grand tapestry of American society, a subtle yet insidious thread of gender discrimination still weaves its way through the fabric of our existence. It is an issue that persists, a constant reminder of the battles yet to be won in our pursuit of equality. The struggle is not limited to women alone, though they bear the brunt of it, their progress hindered by the glass ceiling that still bars their ascent to positions of power. The weight of societal expectations, forged over centuries, holds them back, making it a rarity to find a man willing to submit to a woman's authority.\n\nThe workplace, a crucible of human endeavor, is not immune to this affliction. A woman, equipped with the necessary qualifications, yet finds herself overlooked for a promotion, her male colleagues unwilling to accept her as a leader. The reasons are manifold, rooted in the ingrained prejudices of a bygone era. And it is not just women who suffer; men, too, are trapped in the prison of societal norms. The stay-at-home father, once an anomaly, is now becoming more accepted, his decision to prioritize family over career met with a mixture of curiosity and disdain.\n\nIn the rarefied world of fashion, a similar dynamic plays out. The male who dares to enter this realm is often viewed with skepticism, his motivations questioned, his expertise doubted. It is a cruel irony that a man's style, once a badge of confidence, now raises eyebrows, his qualifications dismissed as superficial. The industry is not unique in this regard; in every field, there are those who will resist change, clinging to the familiar, even as the world around them evolves.\n\nThe pace of progress is glacial, a testament to the entrenched nature of these biases. Yet, there are signs of hope. Women are ascending to positions of power, their abilities recognized, their leadership accepted. The stay-at-home father, once seen as an aberration, is becoming the norm. And in the fashion world, men are beginning to be taken seriously, their opinions valued, their expertise respected.\n\nBut change is a fragile thing, easily lost if forced upon society too quickly. It must be nurtured, coaxed forth, like a wildflower blooming in the desert. The qualities of those who are stereotyped must be promoted, their strengths highlighted, their achievements celebrated. And it is not just a matter of promoting individual successes; it is a matter of changing the very fabric of our society, of unraveling the threads of prejudice that have held us back for so long.\n\nIn this slow, arduous process, there are many who will resist, clinging to the familiar, the comfortable. But we must press on, our efforts sustained by the knowledge that, eventually, the tide will turn. The world will come to recognize the value of the stay-at-home father, the contributions of the fashion-conscious man, and the leadership of the woman, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectations.\n\nIn the end, it is not just a matter of individual struggle, but a collective effort to create a society where everyone is valued, where every individual has the opportunity to reach their full potential, unencumbered by the shackles of prejudice and bias. It is a lofty goal, one that will take time, patience, and perseverance, but it is a goal worth striving for, a world where every individual can live without the burden of societal expectations, free to be themselves, to pursue their dreams, and to thrive.",
            "Decriminalization, a notion that has gradually seeped into the fabric of our society, a shift from the rigid laws of yore to a more lenient, almost dismissive stance.  The consequences, once dire and far-reaching, now bear a resemblance to a trivial traffic infraction, a blemish on one's record, but a stain nonetheless.  The specter of arrest, imprisonment, and the trappings of the justice system now recede into the background, a distant memory, as the weight of a citation takes its place.\n\nBut this is not without its repercussions.  The future, a labyrinth of uncertainty, still holds its terrors, the specter of job interviews, the whispered queries of a past that refuses to stay buried.  The decriminalization of marijuana, a respite from the weight of the law, does not necessarily erase the shadows that follow.  And yet, there are those who argue that the costs of prosecuting, of jailing, of housing and then releasing, are prohibitive, a drain on resources better spent elsewhere.\n\nIn municipalities beleaguered by fiscal woes, the philosophy of expediency often prevails.  The allure of freed-up funds, a siren's call to a brighter future, proves too great to resist.  In places like Denver, where the winds of progress blow strong, the tide of opinion has shifted, and the once-taboo now finds itself on the cusp of acceptance.\n\nBut there are those who would caution against a wholesale legalization, a fear that the norm of moderation will give way to a free-for-all, a plague of pot-smoking wafting through the streets like a malignant fog.  The specter of impaired driving, a threat to public safety, is a concern that cannot be ignored.  And yet, the line between prohibition and permissiveness is a thin one, a tightrope walked by those who would navigate the complex landscape of substance use.\n\nThe fact remains, no two individuals react in the same way to the same substance.  Some, like the tempestuous sea, are tossed about by the waves of their own making, while others, like the still waters of a forgotten lake, seem impervious to the whims of fate.  And so, we are left with the inescapable truth that substances, like human nature itself, are a mystery, a labyrinth of contradictions, and the line between progress and perdition is often blurred beyond recognition.",
            "The tedium of tradition weighs heavy on the soul. They cling to the familiar, the tried and the true, as if the passage of time held no sway over the rituals they hold dear. And yet, in their rigidity, they forget the value of flexibility, of yielding to the whispers of a changing world.\n\nThe Church, a bastion of unyielding doctrine, stands sentinel, unyielding in its expectations. Those who fail to conform to its strictures are cast aside, deemed unworthy of its acceptance. The teachings of love and compassion, once a beacon of hope, now ring hollow in the face of intolerance. For in the end, it is not the imperfect who are rejected, but those who dare to differ.\n\nI recall the tale of my parents, forbidden to wed in the very institution that claimed to spread love and acceptance. My father, a man of Episcopalian faith, could not be joined to my mother, a woman of Catholic conviction, for the sake of his differing creed. Such is the nature of a faith that elevates dogma over compassion.\n\nThe disconnect between doctrine and practice is a chasm that yawns wide, a void that cannot be bridged by empty words. We are taught to love our neighbors, to extend a hand to those in need, yet we are denied the very thing that would bring us closer to our fellow man. The outdated, the rigid, and the unyielding – such are the hallmarks of a faith that would rather cling to the past than adapt to the present.\n\nAnd so, I pose the question: would allowing priests to marry eradicate the scourge of pedophilia that plagues the Church? I think not. The depravity that drives such acts is not a product of marital status, but of a darkness that resides within the human heart. To believe otherwise is to reveal a naivety that is both tragic and telling.",
            "The morass of morality, a tangled skein that entwines the sacred and the profane, beckons me, a siren's call to clarity, which I dare not answer. The waters of conscience, a churning sea, swirl with the undertow of conviction, and I, a humble observer, am drawn beneath its surface.\n\nTo separate the church from the state, a distinction so finely drawn, yet so fraught with peril, is a task akin to navigating a treacherous shoal. The definable waters of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil union to others, threaten to capsize the ship of reason, sending the unwary to the depths.\n\nThe union of two people, a bond that transcends the mundane, is not for the state to define. Let us not confuse the sacred with the secular, lest we invite the very chaos we seek to avoid. The government, a behemoth of bureaucracy, should not concern itself with the sacramental aspects of matrimony, lest it imperil the delicate balance between the church and the state.\n\nThe question of gay marriage, a tempest in a teapot, should not be reduced to a constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, reserved for the weightiest of matters. It is a trifling concern, a mere flutter in the dovecote of debate, not worthy of the sacred parchment that is our constitution.\n\nLet the states, those bastions of autonomy, find their own path, their own reasoning, and if the winds of change blow strong enough, let them be carried to the federal level. But to amend the constitution, a document hallowed by the blood of our forefathers, for such a trifling matter, is an affront to the very principles it enshrines.\n\nNo, let us not sully the constitution with the petty squabbles of the righteous, but rather let us navigate the turbulent waters of morality with a steady hand, ever mindful of the perils that lie beneath the surface.",
            "The gray expanse of my upbringing, a Christian home where certainties were forged like tempered steel, left me with a lingering unease when it came to the matter of homosexuality. The friendships I've formed with individuals who walk this path have only served to deepen the complexity of my perspective. I do not pretend to fully comprehend the intricacies of this lifestyle, nor do I think it necessary to concur with it. Yet, I am persuaded that the institution of marriage should be a choice left to the individuals, not decreed by some distant authority.\n\nThe notion that the federal government should dictate the legal status of same-sex unions strikes me as an affront to the democratic principles that govern our land. The disparate ideologies of our states - some liberal, others conservative - should be allowed to flourish, or wither, as each sees fit. Does not the freedom to choose one's own destiny include the freedom to decide how to live in harmony with others? I do not believe the President, or any single individual, has the right to impose their will upon the nation, particularly when it comes to the most intimate aspects of our lives.\n\nIt is the individual states, with their unique character and values, that should be entrusted with the decision to recognize the rights of same-sex couples. This is not a matter of federal intervention, but rather a local affair, subject to the whims of the people who live there. And when a state chooses to legalize same-sex marriage, it is not for outsiders to dispute their decision, but rather for us to respect the will of those who have chosen to reside within their borders.\n\nAs for the President's stance on this matter, I find it a curious thing that one man, no matter how powerful, should presume to dictate the laws of an entire nation. His tenure is limited, a fleeting moment in the annals of time, and what is left behind is a legacy of decisions, some of which may prove wise, others not so much. Let us not forget that the true authority lies with the people, and not with any single individual, no matter how high their station.",
            "The notion of Myspace as a public domain eludes me not. It is a platform where the boundaries between private and public are blurred, where the lines are constantly shifting like the sands of the desert. The idea that one's thoughts and actions are private is a misguided notion, a relic of a bygone era. Once something is posted on the internet, it is akin to a stone cast into a still pond, rippling outward, touching every shore, every soul. The notion that a school official's intrusion into the private lives of students is an invasion of their rights is a tired argument, one that crumbles beneath the weight of reason.\n\nConsider this: if a student posts something on Myspace, they are, in effect, casting that stone into the pond. They are broadcasting their thoughts, their feelings, their very essence to the world. And in doing so, they are relinquishing any expectation of privacy. The school officials, like the ripples on the pond, can detect the disturbance, the tremors that emanate from that stone. They can sense the mood of the student body, the undercurrents of discontent or despair. And in doing so, they can take steps to prevent the calamities that can arise from such turmoil.\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher of mine, one who spoke of the importance of vigilance in the face of potential threats. \"We must ensure the safety of our students,\" they said, \"at all costs.\" And I agreed. The lockdown drills, the drills for terrorist attacks, the measures taken to prevent the unthinkable from happening - all of these are a testament to the school's commitment to safety. And so, I ask you, is it not reasonable for school officials to take similar measures to prevent the very real threat of school shootings? Is it not their duty to do so, to safeguard the lives of their students?\n\nThe notion that they were overstepping their bounds is a misinterpretation of their actions. They were not snooping for the sake of snooping; they were acting to prevent harm, to save lives. And in doing so, they were doing their job. The internet has made us all public figures, our actions and words broadcast to the world for all to see. And in this world, the school officials were merely doing their part to ensure that the ripples of our actions do not spread far enough to cause harm.",
            "The memory of that day still sears itself into my mind like a branding iron, a fire that refuses to be extinguished. I was swept up in the fervor, convinced that our response to the devastation of nine eleven would be a righteous crusade, a just retribution for the unspeakable horrors inflicted upon our own soil. But as I looked deeper, I began to see the cracks in the façade, the fissures that would eventually shatter our resolve.\n\nIt was a war born of passion, not reason. We charged forward with little regard for the long game, our actions driven by a hunger for vengeance rather than a clear-eyed understanding of the landscape we sought to alter. The enemy, a people with a culture as old as the earth itself, was reduced to a one-dimensional concept, a monolith of savagery that we sought to vanquish.\n\nBut we were blind to the reality of their world, a world where war was not a distant abstraction, but a lived experience, a way of life. We charged in, guns blazing, with no plan, no understanding, and no expectation of the consequences. And in that chaos, we lost ourselves, our purpose, and our way.\n\nI have come to realize that we were not the liberators we thought ourselves to be, but rather the aggressors, imposing our will upon a people who would rather fight among themselves than submit to our benevolence. The war was a manifestation of our own fears, our own insecurities, and our own frailty. We sought to impose order on a world that was not ours to order.\n\nIn the end, I am left with a sense of disillusionment, a feeling that we were never meant to win, that we were never meant to change them. They are a people with a history as long as the desert sands, and we are but a fleeting moment, a momentary blip on the radar of time. Our presence only serves to prolong their suffering, to prolong our own.\n\nI do not know what the future holds, but I know that our presence in their land is a double-edged sword, a sword that cuts both ways. We may have made progress, but it is progress that is fragile, fleeting, and ultimately, unsustainable. We cannot stay forever, and when we leave, the void we created will be filled with the dust of centuries, and the cycle will begin anew.\n\nI am left with a sense of resignation, a sense that we are not the saviors we thought ourselves to be, but rather the authors of our own undoing. We must leave, not because we have accomplished our goals, but because we have lost ourselves in the process. We must leave, not because we have created a new world, but because we have created a new reality, a reality that is as fragile as the sandcastles we build on the shifting dunes of time."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church stands at a precipice, its foundation shaken by the tides of time. Its once unwavering stance on the matters of the soul now seems anachronistic to the masses. The weight of tradition bears down upon it, yet it is a weight that may be its own undoing. The Church's rigid views on matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control have spawned a division within its ranks, a chasm that threatens to swallow its very essence.\n\nThe Church's views, though rooted in the depths of history, seem to belong to a bygone era. In an age of enlightenment and progress, its stance on these issues can only be seen as a relic of a bygone time. The Church's inflexibility has alienated many, causing them to turn away from the institution that once held such sway over their lives.\n\nThe notion that the Church's stance on these issues is a major contributor to its waning influence is not a conjecture, but a fact. Those who hold dear the values of compassion and inclusivity find themselves at odds with the Church's stance on these matters. For those who believe in the sanctity of life, the Church's opposition to abortion is a non-negotiable aspect of its doctrine. Yet, for those who believe in the right to choose, the Church's stance is a barrier that separates them from the very institution they once called their own.\n\nSimilarly, the Church's views on same-sex marriage have driven a wedge between it and its followers. The denial of the sacrament of marriage to those who love one another regardless of their sex is a wound that will not easily heal. The Church's refusal to acknowledge the humanity of those who identify as LGBTQ+ has led to a crisis of faith, a crisis that threatens to upend the very foundations of the institution.\n\nThe question remains: can the Church adapt to the changing tides of time? Can it find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the needs of a modern world? Or will it remain mired in the quicksand of its own making, a relic of a bygone era that refuses to evolve? The answer, much like the future, is uncertain.\n\nAs for the issue of female priests and married clergy, it is a debate that rages on. The Church's stance on these matters may seem anachronistic, but it is a stance that is rooted in its own history and tradition. Yet, one cannot help but wonder: would a more inclusive Church, one that allows for the ordination of women and the marriage of its clergy, be a Church that is more in tune with the needs of its followers? Or would it be a Church that has sacrificed its very essence in the name of progress?\n\nThe truth is, we may never know. But one thing is certain: the Catholic Church stands at a crossroads, a crossroads that will determine its future. Will it continue down the path of tradition, or will it embark on a new journey, one that is guided by the principles of compassion and inclusivity? The choice is not an easy one, but it is a choice that must be made if the Church is to survive in a world that is rapidly changing.",
            "In a world beset by the weight of unyielding certainties, I find myself drawn to a position of quiet conviction. The issue of gay marriage, a topic oft shrouded in controversy, has long been the subject of debate. My own stance on the matter is clear: I do not believe that a person's sexual orientation is a choice to be made, or a decision to be taken lightly. The notion that one can choose to be gay, or straight, is a notion that strikes me as a cruel misapprehension. It is a cruel fate to be born with an inescapable truth, only to be met with scorn and derision by those who claim to be the guardians of societal norms.\n\nTo suggest that a man and a woman may wed, while a union between two individuals of the same sex is deemed taboo, is a stark reminder of the hypocrisies that plague our society. It is a doctrine that I do not subscribe to, for it smacks of a rigid moral framework that seeks to dictate the terms of love and devotion. The idea that the federal government should intervene in such matters is a farce, a pretension that seeks to impose its will upon the lives of individuals who are merely seeking to live their truth.\n\nIn an era marked by complexity and nuance, we would do well to remember that the human experience is a labyrinth of contradictions. It is a tapestry woven from threads of love, desire, and acceptance. To reduce the lives of gay individuals to a simplistic calculus of right and wrong is to do them a grave injustice. They are not actors in a grand play, choosing their roles with deliberation and forethought. They are, quite simply, human beings, deserving of the same dignity and respect as any other.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the federal government to decide who may love, and who may not. It is not for us to impose our will upon the lives of others, to dictate the terms of their existence. The only truth that matters is the one that arises from the depths of the human heart, where love knows no bounds, and acceptance is the only currency that truly matters.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of human relationships, a solitary question hangs like a specter: what is the nature of love? Is it a flame that flickers between two souls, or a cold calculus of law and custom? We speak of gay marriage as if it were a foreign entity, a thing apart from the norm. But what is the norm? Is it a set of rigid expectations, a straitjacket of conventional wisdom? Or is it the messy, beautiful chaos of human connection?\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family is a tired refrain, a refrain that echoes through the halls of history. But what of the countless studies that have shown the similarities between gay and straight relationships? The same factors contribute to satisfaction, the same rates of success. Is it not the same thing, then? A bond between two people, forged in the fire of love and commitment?\n\nAnd yet, we are told that this bond is not enough. That the union of two consenting adults is somehow tainted by the absence of a church-sanctioned ritual. But what of the marriage certificate, that sterile document of state and law? Is it not the same thing, in the end, as a union of love and commitment? To deny it is to deny the very fabric of human relationship.\n\nWe speak of segregation, of separate but equal. But what of the inherent inequality of a system that denies recognition to one group, while granting it to another? Is it not a form of institutionalized prejudice, a reminder that our society is built on a foundation of exclusion and fear?\n\nAnd what of the children, those tiny, vulnerable things that we claim to care about? Do they not deserve the same love and protection, regardless of their parents' orientation? Is it not our duty to create a world where they can grow and thrive, free from the shadows of prejudice and fear?\n\nThe federal government, that great behemoth of bureaucracy and custom, has the power to shape our society. Let it use that power to create a world where love is not a privilege, but a right. Let it recognize the union of two consenting adults, regardless of their orientation. For in the end, it is not a question of morality or religion, but of humanity.\n\nWe are a nation of contradictions, a people torn between light and darkness. We speak of freedom and equality, while denying it to those who need it most. We claim to be a land of opportunity, while limiting the opportunities of those who are different. But we can do better. We can create a world where love is the only law, and where every human being is treated with dignity and respect.\n\nFor in the end, it is not about gay marriage, but about the human condition. It is about our capacity for love, our capacity for compassion, and our capacity for understanding. Let us not be swayed by fear and prejudice, but by a desire for a better world, a world where every human being can live in peace and dignity.",
            "The sterile glow of the hospital pharmacy's fluorescent lights cast an unforgiving glare upon the summer's hazy heat. I've worked among the sterile rows of vials and syringes, the soft beeps of machinery a constant heartbeat in the background. It's there, amidst the sterile quiet, that I've come to realize the truth: the line between licit and illicit is a blurred one. The efficacy of a substance is not determined by its legality, but by its utility. I've seen it in the controlled substances we dispense daily - oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet. They're the unsung heroes of the pharmaceutical world, their benefits undeniable.\n\nBut marijuana, that most maligned of substances, is bound by the shackles of taboo. We're reluctant to acknowledge its potential, to consider the possibility that its benefits might outweigh its drawbacks. It's a notion that's as futile as it is foolish. We've seen the devastation wrought by the demonization of substances like heroin and cocaine. Why, then, do we cling to this myth of marijuana as a menace? The truth is, it's not so different from the vices we already permit. It's a substance, nothing more, nothing less. Its risks, its benefits - they're not inherent to its legality, but to its use.\n\nThe notion that gradual legalization is the key to responsible use is a fragile reed to cling to. It's a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. The first step is to strip away the shroud of stigma that surrounds marijuana. Only then can we begin to see it for what it is: a tool, a substance that can be wielded for good or ill. We'd do well to remember that the line between use and abuse is a thin one, and that the demonization of a substance only serves to drive it further into the shadows. It's time to confront the truth: marijuana is not the devil we've made it out to be. It's a substance with benefits, and it's high time we acknowledge it.",
            "The church, like all things, has been reshaped by the tempests of time. Its stony facade, once a bastion of tradition, now wears a more supple countenance, one that bends to accommodate the whims of the modern world. Gone are the days of Sunday finery, when the faithful donned their finest attire to pay homage to the sacred. Now, the faithful gather in a more subdued, yet no less fervent, assembly. The masses, once a solemn affair, have been truncated to a mere thirty minutes, a concession to the brevity of our attention spans.\n\nAs I look back on my own experiences, I am struck by the manner in which the church has adapted to the changing tides of society. The once-revered Sunday ritual, where I would don my finest dress and shoes, has given way to a more relaxed, even casual, atmosphere. The summer months bring a particularly stark contrast, with beachwear a common sight among the congregation. Even the morning masses, once a time for solemn reflection, now see the faithful arrayed in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the formal attire of yesteryear.\n\nBut these changes, while notable, are but a pale reflection of the deeper concerns that beset the church. The allegations of pedophilia, a scourge that has tarnished the institution's good name, are a more profound issue. Some might suggest that a more relaxed, even progressive, approach – such as the ordination of women or the marriage of priests – might have prevented these atrocities. I disagree. The roots of such depravity run deeper, to the very marrow of human nature. Men, married or unmarried, are capable of unspeakable cruelty. It is not the institution that breeds such monsters, but the darkness that lies within.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the inclinations of such individuals are rooted in their very essence, a product of genetics rather than environment. We are born with our inclinations, and no societal strictures can alter the fundamental nature of our being. Marriage, or the lack thereof, is but a mere societal construct, a thin veneer that cannot mask the underlying truths of human nature. The church, in its attempts to prevent such abuses, must look to its own ranks, and consider the failings of its own members. For it is not the institution that is flawed, but the individuals who call themselves its servants.\n\nIn conclusion, I am left with a sense of detachment, a feeling that the church's efforts to adapt to the changing world are but a palliative measure, a soothing balm that does little to address the deeper wounds that afflict it. The church must look inward, to its own heart, and confront the darkness that lurks within its own bosom. Only then can it hope to emerge, scarred but redeemed, into the light of a new dawn.",
            "The memory of that fateful day still lingers, a wound that refuses to heal. The echoes of September 11th still resound, a clarion call to recklessness and hubris. We descended upon Iraq, a pretext born of desperation, a justification conjured from the ether. The Bush administration wove a tapestry of deceit, linking Saddam Hussein to the architects of terror, and the specter of WMDs cast a shadow over the land. But the threads of truth were soon to fray, exposing the frayed edges of a lie.\n\nIt was a sleight of hand, a conjurer's trick played upon the American people. Colin Powell, once a stalwart champion of the administration's cause, now confesses to doubt, his voice a whispered admission of malfeasance. The weight of his words settles like a shroud, a reminder that the constitution has been trampled, its principles cast aside like so much discarded trash.\n\nA disregard for the rule of law had been sown long before the ashes of the Twin Towers had cooled. The seeds of a vendetta had been planted, nurtured by the memories of a father's failed ambitions. Young Bush's eyes burned with a fire of vengeance, a desire to settle old scores and expand the reach of American power. The lure of oil, a siren's song, beckoned him forward, a promise of riches and control.\n\nTime has worn away the façade, revealing the abyss of our actions. The country teeters on the brink, a fragile balance between order and chaos. The specter of civil war looms, a specter that haunts the dreams of those who would seek to withdraw. And yet, the alternative, a coalition of nations, offers little solace. The Iraqi Parliament falters, a ship without rudder or anchor, adrift in a sea of uncertainty.\n\nThe interim government, a fragile edifice, crumbles beneath the weight of its own ineffectiveness. The Prime Minister's grasp is tenuous at best, his control a mere illusion. The radical elements, a hydra-headed beast, continue to stir, their influence spreading like a stain. The very fabric of the state is fraying, a tapestry rent asunder by the conflicting threads of power and ambition.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of articulating a solution, but of acknowledging the depths of our transgression. The hubris of our actions has left us lost, wandering in a wilderness of our own making. The ghosts of our past haunt us still, a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that the price of our recklessness will be paid in full.",
            "In the desolate vastness of our collective consciousness, a war rages on, a conflict that has consumed the minds of nations, leaving only ash and desolation in its wake. The War in Iraq, a specter that haunts our discourse, a maelstrom of conflicting ideologies and motivations. I find myself lost in the labyrinthine corridors of my own thoughts, struggling to articulate a coherent stance, a thread of conviction amidst the tangled web of uncertainty.\n\nIt is said that the war was born of a desire for vengeance, a tit-for-tat response to the wounds inflicted upon us on that fateful day, September 11th. Yet, as the years have passed, the reasons for our presence have become increasingly obscure, a blurred tapestry of competing interests and ideologies. We speak of democracy, of freedom, of the noble pursuit of oil, but the truth is, the war has become a protracted, Sisyphean endeavor, a futile effort to impose our will upon a people who have been forever changed by our actions.\n\nAs I ponder the complexities of this conflict, I am reminded of the Vietnam War, a declared war that became an undeclared quagmire, a war without purpose or end. Would we not repeat the same mistakes, perpetuating a cycle of violence and mistrust, as we try to shape the Iraqi people in our image? The ghosts of history whisper caution, warning us of the perils of cultural imperialism, of the folly of attempting to impose our values upon a people who have their own distinct narrative, their own struggles and triumphs.\n\nAnd yet, as I reflect on the faces of the soldiers who have been sent to fight this war, the families who have been torn apart by its ravages, I am torn asunder by conflicting emotions. I want to see them return home, to know that their loved ones are safe, but I fear that our continued presence only perpetuates the cycle of violence, that we are sowing the seeds of hatred and resentment, which will one day bear fruit in the form of a generation of Iraqis who will forever be wary of our intentions.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, a sense of disillusionment and frustration that threatens to consume me whole. The war in Iraq is a Gordian knot, a puzzle that refuses to yield its secrets, a labyrinth from which there is no escape. I can only offer this: that we must extricate ourselves from this quagmire, that we must find a way to withdraw, to allow the Iraqis to forge their own path, to chart their own destiny, free from the weight of our interference.",
            "The notion of a state imposing its will upon the sacred is a grievous affront to the very fabric of our democracy. It is a perversion of the constitution, a document etched in stone with the principles of freedom and the separation of church and state. To seek to enshrine in law the dictates of one faith over another is to invite the demons of intolerance and oppression.\n\nThe constitution's clear and unambiguous language speaks to the freedom of worship, unencumbered by the heavy hand of government. To tamper with this sacred text, to seek to amend it according to the whims of a particular faith, is to betray the trust of the founders and to invite chaos and strife. It is a proposition that reeks of hubris and a disregard for the diversity of our great nation.\n\nThose who would seek to impose their will upon the churches, to dictate what is and is not permissible, do so at their own peril. They reveal themselves to be advocates of a narrow and exclusivist creed, one that seeks to strangle the very life from the body of our republic. The people, not the government, must decide what is and is not acceptable in the realm of faith. To suggest otherwise is to invite the very tyranny they claim to abhor.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our democracy, a bulwark against the encroachment of theocracy and the restriction of individual liberty. To tamper with this fundamental principle is to risk the very foundations of our society. It is a proposition that would enshrine the interests of the powerful over the rights of the marginalized, and would perpetuate the very intolerance it claims to eradicate.\n\nThe motivations behind this proposed amendment are suspect, driven as they are by personal conviction rather than a genuine concern for the common good. The president's advocacy for this measure reeks of a zealotry that is at odds with the principles of our republic. His actions are a testament to the dangers of unchecked power and the corrupting influence of personal faith.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the government to decide what is and is not acceptable in the realm of faith. It is for the people, in their wisdom and diversity, to determine what is just and what is not. To seek to impose one's will upon the churches is to invite the very darkness that our constitution was meant to vanquish. We must resist this perversion of our democracy, and uphold the sacred principles of freedom and tolerance that have made our nation great.",
            "The war in Iraq - a conflict born of deception and fueled by hubris. It began with a foundation of uncertainty, a shroud of dishonesty cast over the American people by their government. The reasons for invasion, a tenuous web of connections to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, were spun with a deftness that belied the truth. The wound of 9/11 still fresh, the nation's outrage was exploited, and the invasion of Iraq became a fait accompli in 2003.\n\nAs one opposed to war, particularly the preemptive kind, I watched with a sense of foreboding as the conflict unfolded. The parallels between Iraq and Vietnam were stark, a repeat of past mistakes, and the lessons of history ignored. The toll in American lives was staggering, a testament to the futility of conflict, and the void left by the removal of a government was met with chaos.\n\nThe vaunted promise of implanting democracy in Iraq was a chimera, a dream born of idealism and a failure to grasp the complexities of the region. The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a haunting reminder of the perils of nation-building. The American government, woefully unprepared for the aftermath, stumbled blindly into the void, leaving a trail of destruction and death in its wake.\n\nThe removal of a government, a people's way of life, and the imposition of a new order - these are not tasks to be undertaken lightly. The US government, blinded by its own ambition, failed to plan for the consequences of its actions, and the people of Iraq paid the price. The insurgency, a hydra-like force, sprouted in the power vacuum, its tendrils entwining the very fabric of the country.\n\nThe reasons for invasion, a tissue of half-truths and misrepresentations, were slowly unraveled. The absence of WMDs, the duplicity of the government's justifications, and the selective application of force - all these served to erode the moral high ground upon which the war was fought. And through it all, the cries of \"it was for the oil\" hung in the air, a whispered truth that refused to be silenced.\n\nAs the years dragged on, the toll in American lives mounted, and the promise of a democratic Iraq receded further into the distance. The government's hubris, its failure to plan for the consequences of its actions, and its willingness to deceive the American people - all these served to undermine the war effort, leaving behind a legacy of blood and ashes.\n\nAnd so, as the conflict grinds on, we are left with the haunting question: at what cost? The answer, a distant hum in the darkness, whispers of a future where peace is a distant memory, and the ghosts of the past continue to haunt us still.",
            "The notion of gay marriage has long been a conviction of mine, a steadfast resolve that has driven my thoughts and feelings on the matter. It is a personal preference, one that defies the arbitrary boundaries of societal expectation and reduces to its most fundamental essence the very fabric of human experience. The sciences have increasingly revealed that the inclinations of the heart are not solely the product of environment, but rather a complex interplay of biology and genetics. To deny individuals the right to love and commit to one another based on factors beyond their control is an affront to the inherent dignity of the human condition.\n\nThe intrusion of politics into this most intimate of matters is an affront to the very notion of personal freedom. Marriage is a private pact, a bond forged between two individuals, and it is not for the state to dictate the terms of love and commitment. In my neighborhood, I've witnessed firsthand the quiet beauty of love, as gay couples walk hand in hand, their love as palpable as the sun on a summer's day. Yet, they are denied the simple recognition of marriage, a right afforded to all others, and it is a travesty.\n\nThe notion that a president, or any politician, can interpret the sacred institution of marriage as they see fit is a mockery of the very concept. It is a hubris that reduces the complexity of human experience to a simplistic, dogmatic framework. I've read and studied the scientific consensus, the mounting evidence that suggests our inclinations are not shaped by upbringing or environment, but are rooted in the very biology of our being.\n\nThe disparity between how society treats gay couples and heterosexual couples is stark. A man and a woman can flee to Vegas, marry in secret, and return home, their union unremarked upon, while a gay couple's love is subject to the scrutiny of the national spotlight. It is a cruel irony that a private act, a personal commitment, is thrust into the public domain, subject to the whims of politicians and moral absolutists.",
            "The desolate vastness of the internet, a forum for the thoughts and desires of the damned. When we release our words into this void, we invite the unforgiving gaze of the masses. It is a public domain, a place where the lines of privacy are blurred and the whispers of the individual are magnified. As a resident advisor, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this digital expanse. The careless words, the jests, the threats - all are laid bare for the world to see.\n\nThe repercussions are dire: a single misstep, a thoughtless post, and the fabric of perception is torn asunder. The very notion of anonymity is a farce, for the internet knows no bounds. It crawls into the crevices of our lives, seeping into the recesses of our souls. A friend, a Myspace connection, a Facebook acquaintance - all are potential conduits for the whispers of the wind. And when the winds of worry blow, the school is forced to act, lest the seeds of catastrophe be sown.\n\nBut how do we discern the seriousness of the threat? Can we trust the online jests of our peers, or do they mask a darker intent? The incident that befell our school serves as a stark reminder of the blurred lines between reality and the virtual world. A careless remark, a joke taken out of context, and the consequences are dire. The school's vigilance is not an invasion of privacy, but a necessary response to the uncertainty that pervades this digital age. When we choose to expose ourselves online, we relinquish our right to control the narrative.\n\nAnd yet, the boundaries remain, fragile and easily breached. The school officials' actions, though well-intentioned, walk a fine line between surveillance and invasion. The monitoring of phone conversations, texts, and IMs is a heavy burden, one that weighs heavily on the scales of freedom. The creation of a pseudonymous account, a friend request from a teacher, a peek into the private lives of students - all these raise questions about the nature of trust and the role of authority.\n\nThe internet is a double-edged sword, capable of both uniting and isolating us. As a resident advisor, I have come to realize that the digital realm is a labyrinth of contradictions, a place where the lines between public and private are constantly shifting. We must navigate this void with caution, ever mindful of the words we choose to release into the void. For in the end, it is not the technology that is to blame, but our own frailty, our own propensity for error.",
            "The war has worn on, a sputtering ember of a purpose that once flickered bright with promise. At its inception, the notion was to breathe life into a suffocating regime, to birth democracy from the ashes of tyranny. But time has seen the intention grow twisted, like a willow in the wind. We speak of a restoration of freedom, yet the truth lies mired in the muck of ulterior motives. The echoes of George Bush's elder whispers still linger, a shadow of a vendetta that may have been the spark that set this inferno ablaze.\n\nThe initial blaze of conviction has given way to a smoldering fire, a war of attrition that grinds on without purpose. The early days, a resolute declaration of our presence, a statement to the world of our unyielding resolve. But years have passed, and the flames have died down to a dull glow. We are left with a war that has lost its way, a conflict that has become a perpetual motion, a machine that chugs along without end or purpose.\n\nWe have poured our treasure into this desert, a river of gold that drains our own economy, leaving our own people to suffer. The weight of war bears down upon us, a crushing burden that threatens to break our backs. The money we spend on this foreign venture could be spent on the internal fires that rage within our own borders - poverty, neglect, the ravages of disease. Our own citizens cry out for help, their voices drowned out by the din of war.\n\nWe speak of victory, of a decisive end, but the truth is we have been defeated by our own doubts. We have lost sight of the purpose that once drove us, and now we are left to pick up the pieces of a shattered ideal. It is time to let go, to allow the people of this land to forge their own destiny. The war has dragged on long enough; it is time to bring our boys home.",
            "The question of whether the life of another can be spared by the vigilance of a stranger in the digital realm is a complex and troubling one. It is said that a person's online presence, a virtual shadow that follows them like a ghost, was discovered by someone who had the power to prevent a tragedy. This person, a guardian of sorts, had accessed a site where one's personal information is laid bare for all to see, and had intervened to spare a life.\n\nBut what of the nature of this information? Does it not belong to the individual who posts it, who knowingly commits it to the void of cyberspace? Is it not a surrender of one's private self, a deliberate act of exposure? And yet, once released, can it ever truly be taken back? The notion is disquieting, a specter that haunts the digital age.\n\nThe idea of a person, a sentinel of sorts, scouring the online profiles of students, searching for signs of danger, is a disturbing one. It smacks of a discriminatory impulse, a desire to micromanage the lives of others. And yet, in a world where the virtual and the real are increasingly intertwined, is this not a necessary evil? The line between surveillance and protection is a fine one, and it is a line that is constantly shifting.\n\nI must confess, I am uneasy about the ease with which information can be obtained online. A few clicks, a few keystrokes, and a stranger can know more about me than I care to share. It is a disquieting feeling, a sense of vulnerability that I do not wish to experience. And yet, I understand the utility of such sites, the connections they provide and the communities they foster.\n\nBut what of the responsibility that comes with this power? Can we truly know who is watching, who is searching for us in the digital shadows? My roommate's story of the school that banned Myspace is telling, a cautionary tale of the blurred lines between privacy and oversight. It is a question that haunts me still, a reminder of the fragile balance between freedom and control in the virtual world.",
            "The weight of hindsight settles heavy upon us, a crushing burden born of a war that was never meant to be. The Iraq War, a calamity of our making, a maelstrom of blood and rubble that refuses to subside. We speak of it now, a generation removed, and the words feel hollow, a faint echo of a catastrophe that has left its mark upon the world.\n\nI feel a certain unease in speaking out against the war, a sense of hypocrisy that clings to me like a shroud. For I was complicit, a part of the chorus that sang of its justification, even as the drums of war beat on. But the truth, like a cold wind, has blown through, revealing the emptiness of our claims. The polls, a testament to the world's collective wisdom, tell us that nearly eighty percent of humanity deemed the invasion a grave mistake. The Iraqis themselves, the very people we sought to liberate, cry out for our departure, a sentiment shared by a majority of their own troops. And the U.S. soldiers, weary and worn, their hearts heavy with the knowledge of a futile endeavor, whisper the same refrain.\n\nThis is a disaster, a quagmire that has been unfolding since the moment we set foot in that unforgiving land. The culture clash, a chasm so wide and deep, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the feeble attempts of our politicians to impose their will upon the people. Democracy, a concept born of our own ideals, is not theirs to claim, nor is it a gift to be bestowed upon them. The likes of Saddam, a tyrant to be sure, are replaced by an even greater evil, the evil of occupation, of desecration, of a people's way of life torn asunder.\n\nWe were warned, and we ignored the signs. The quicksand of history sucked us in, and now we are mired, unable to extricate ourselves. The administration's justifications, a litany of half-truths and misconceptions, ring hollow in the face of reality. I have yet to hear a persuasive argument for our continued presence in Iraq. The problems that would arise from our withdrawal, yes, but the reasons for our stay, a mere whisper of a justification, a mere shadow of a reason.\n\nPerhaps, if we were to leave gradually, a slow and painful withdrawal, it would be a more palatable solution. But to stay, to prolong the agony, to continue to bleed the life from that forsaken land? No, I do not see the sense in it. The Iraqis, those we sought to save, those we claimed to liberate, now tell us to leave, to depart, to cease our interference in their affairs. And we, the self-appointed saviors, the bringers of light to a dark land, are met with scorn and suspicion.\n\nWe are not the good guys, nor will we ever be. We are the architects of this disaster, the perpetrators of this crime. But to leave now, to acknowledge our folly, to confess our mistakes, this, perhaps, would be a small step towards redemption. It is a step that we have yet to take, a step that we may yet take, but for now, we stand frozen, mired in the quicksand of our own making.",
            "In the grand tapestry of American society, a subtle yet insidious thread of gender discrimination still weaves its way through the fabric of our existence. It is an issue that persists, a constant reminder of the battles yet to be won in our pursuit of equality. The struggle is not limited to women alone, though they bear the brunt of it, their progress hindered by the glass ceiling that still bars their ascent to positions of power. The weight of societal expectations, forged over centuries, holds them back, making it a rarity to find a man willing to submit to a woman's authority.\n\nThe workplace, a crucible of human endeavor, is not immune to this affliction. A woman, equipped with the necessary qualifications, yet finds herself overlooked for a promotion, her male colleagues unwilling to accept her as a leader. The reasons are manifold, rooted in the ingrained prejudices of a bygone era. And it is not just women who suffer; men, too, are trapped in the prison of societal norms. The stay-at-home father, once an anomaly, is now becoming more accepted, his decision to prioritize family over career met with a mixture of curiosity and disdain.\n\nIn the rarefied world of fashion, a similar dynamic plays out. The male who dares to enter this realm is often viewed with skepticism, his motivations questioned, his expertise doubted. It is a cruel irony that a man's style, once a badge of confidence, now raises eyebrows, his qualifications dismissed as superficial. The industry is not unique in this regard; in every field, there are those who will resist change, clinging to the familiar, even as the world around them evolves.\n\nThe pace of progress is glacial, a testament to the entrenched nature of these biases. Yet, there are signs of hope. Women are ascending to positions of power, their abilities recognized, their leadership accepted. The stay-at-home father, once seen as an aberration, is becoming the norm. And in the fashion world, men are beginning to be taken seriously, their opinions valued, their expertise respected.\n\nBut change is a fragile thing, easily lost if forced upon society too quickly. It must be nurtured, coaxed forth, like a wildflower blooming in the desert. The qualities of those who are stereotyped must be promoted, their strengths highlighted, their achievements celebrated. And it is not just a matter of promoting individual successes; it is a matter of changing the very fabric of our society, of unraveling the threads of prejudice that have held us back for so long.\n\nIn this slow, arduous process, there are many who will resist, clinging to the familiar, the comfortable. But we must press on, our efforts sustained by the knowledge that, eventually, the tide will turn. The world will come to recognize the value of the stay-at-home father, the contributions of the fashion-conscious man, and the leadership of the woman, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectations.\n\nIn the end, it is not just a matter of individual struggle, but a collective effort to create a society where everyone is valued, where every individual has the opportunity to reach their full potential, unencumbered by the shackles of prejudice and bias. It is a lofty goal, one that will take time, patience, and perseverance, but it is a goal worth striving for, a world where every individual can live without the burden of societal expectations, free to be themselves, to pursue their dreams, and to thrive.",
            "Decriminalization, a notion that has gradually seeped into the fabric of our society, a shift from the rigid laws of yore to a more lenient, almost dismissive stance.  The consequences, once dire and far-reaching, now bear a resemblance to a trivial traffic infraction, a blemish on one's record, but a stain nonetheless.  The specter of arrest, imprisonment, and the trappings of the justice system now recede into the background, a distant memory, as the weight of a citation takes its place.\n\nBut this is not without its repercussions.  The future, a labyrinth of uncertainty, still holds its terrors, the specter of job interviews, the whispered queries of a past that refuses to stay buried.  The decriminalization of marijuana, a respite from the weight of the law, does not necessarily erase the shadows that follow.  And yet, there are those who argue that the costs of prosecuting, of jailing, of housing and then releasing, are prohibitive, a drain on resources better spent elsewhere.\n\nIn municipalities beleaguered by fiscal woes, the philosophy of expediency often prevails.  The allure of freed-up funds, a siren's call to a brighter future, proves too great to resist.  In places like Denver, where the winds of progress blow strong, the tide of opinion has shifted, and the once-taboo now finds itself on the cusp of acceptance.\n\nBut there are those who would caution against a wholesale legalization, a fear that the norm of moderation will give way to a free-for-all, a plague of pot-smoking wafting through the streets like a malignant fog.  The specter of impaired driving, a threat to public safety, is a concern that cannot be ignored.  And yet, the line between prohibition and permissiveness is a thin one, a tightrope walked by those who would navigate the complex landscape of substance use.\n\nThe fact remains, no two individuals react in the same way to the same substance.  Some, like the tempestuous sea, are tossed about by the waves of their own making, while others, like the still waters of a forgotten lake, seem impervious to the whims of fate.  And so, we are left with the inescapable truth that substances, like human nature itself, are a mystery, a labyrinth of contradictions, and the line between progress and perdition is often blurred beyond recognition.",
            "The tedium of tradition weighs heavy on the soul. They cling to the familiar, the tried and the true, as if the passage of time held no sway over the rituals they hold dear. And yet, in their rigidity, they forget the value of flexibility, of yielding to the whispers of a changing world.\n\nThe Church, a bastion of unyielding doctrine, stands sentinel, unyielding in its expectations. Those who fail to conform to its strictures are cast aside, deemed unworthy of its acceptance. The teachings of love and compassion, once a beacon of hope, now ring hollow in the face of intolerance. For in the end, it is not the imperfect who are rejected, but those who dare to differ.\n\nI recall the tale of my parents, forbidden to wed in the very institution that claimed to spread love and acceptance. My father, a man of Episcopalian faith, could not be joined to my mother, a woman of Catholic conviction, for the sake of his differing creed. Such is the nature of a faith that elevates dogma over compassion.\n\nThe disconnect between doctrine and practice is a chasm that yawns wide, a void that cannot be bridged by empty words. We are taught to love our neighbors, to extend a hand to those in need, yet we are denied the very thing that would bring us closer to our fellow man. The outdated, the rigid, and the unyielding – such are the hallmarks of a faith that would rather cling to the past than adapt to the present.\n\nAnd so, I pose the question: would allowing priests to marry eradicate the scourge of pedophilia that plagues the Church? I think not. The depravity that drives such acts is not a product of marital status, but of a darkness that resides within the human heart. To believe otherwise is to reveal a naivety that is both tragic and telling.",
            "The morass of morality, a tangled skein that entwines the sacred and the profane, beckons me, a siren's call to clarity, which I dare not answer. The waters of conscience, a churning sea, swirl with the undertow of conviction, and I, a humble observer, am drawn beneath its surface.\n\nTo separate the church from the state, a distinction so finely drawn, yet so fraught with peril, is a task akin to navigating a treacherous shoal. The definable waters of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil union to others, threaten to capsize the ship of reason, sending the unwary to the depths.\n\nThe union of two people, a bond that transcends the mundane, is not for the state to define. Let us not confuse the sacred with the secular, lest we invite the very chaos we seek to avoid. The government, a behemoth of bureaucracy, should not concern itself with the sacramental aspects of matrimony, lest it imperil the delicate balance between the church and the state.\n\nThe question of gay marriage, a tempest in a teapot, should not be reduced to a constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, reserved for the weightiest of matters. It is a trifling concern, a mere flutter in the dovecote of debate, not worthy of the sacred parchment that is our constitution.\n\nLet the states, those bastions of autonomy, find their own path, their own reasoning, and if the winds of change blow strong enough, let them be carried to the federal level. But to amend the constitution, a document hallowed by the blood of our forefathers, for such a trifling matter, is an affront to the very principles it enshrines.\n\nNo, let us not sully the constitution with the petty squabbles of the righteous, but rather let us navigate the turbulent waters of morality with a steady hand, ever mindful of the perils that lie beneath the surface.",
            "The gray expanse of my upbringing, a Christian home where certainties were forged like tempered steel, left me with a lingering unease when it came to the matter of homosexuality. The friendships I've formed with individuals who walk this path have only served to deepen the complexity of my perspective. I do not pretend to fully comprehend the intricacies of this lifestyle, nor do I think it necessary to concur with it. Yet, I am persuaded that the institution of marriage should be a choice left to the individuals, not decreed by some distant authority.\n\nThe notion that the federal government should dictate the legal status of same-sex unions strikes me as an affront to the democratic principles that govern our land. The disparate ideologies of our states - some liberal, others conservative - should be allowed to flourish, or wither, as each sees fit. Does not the freedom to choose one's own destiny include the freedom to decide how to live in harmony with others? I do not believe the President, or any single individual, has the right to impose their will upon the nation, particularly when it comes to the most intimate aspects of our lives.\n\nIt is the individual states, with their unique character and values, that should be entrusted with the decision to recognize the rights of same-sex couples. This is not a matter of federal intervention, but rather a local affair, subject to the whims of the people who live there. And when a state chooses to legalize same-sex marriage, it is not for outsiders to dispute their decision, but rather for us to respect the will of those who have chosen to reside within their borders.\n\nAs for the President's stance on this matter, I find it a curious thing that one man, no matter how powerful, should presume to dictate the laws of an entire nation. His tenure is limited, a fleeting moment in the annals of time, and what is left behind is a legacy of decisions, some of which may prove wise, others not so much. Let us not forget that the true authority lies with the people, and not with any single individual, no matter how high their station.",
            "The notion of Myspace as a public domain eludes me not. It is a platform where the boundaries between private and public are blurred, where the lines are constantly shifting like the sands of the desert. The idea that one's thoughts and actions are private is a misguided notion, a relic of a bygone era. Once something is posted on the internet, it is akin to a stone cast into a still pond, rippling outward, touching every shore, every soul. The notion that a school official's intrusion into the private lives of students is an invasion of their rights is a tired argument, one that crumbles beneath the weight of reason.\n\nConsider this: if a student posts something on Myspace, they are, in effect, casting that stone into the pond. They are broadcasting their thoughts, their feelings, their very essence to the world. And in doing so, they are relinquishing any expectation of privacy. The school officials, like the ripples on the pond, can detect the disturbance, the tremors that emanate from that stone. They can sense the mood of the student body, the undercurrents of discontent or despair. And in doing so, they can take steps to prevent the calamities that can arise from such turmoil.\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher of mine, one who spoke of the importance of vigilance in the face of potential threats. \"We must ensure the safety of our students,\" they said, \"at all costs.\" And I agreed. The lockdown drills, the drills for terrorist attacks, the measures taken to prevent the unthinkable from happening - all of these are a testament to the school's commitment to safety. And so, I ask you, is it not reasonable for school officials to take similar measures to prevent the very real threat of school shootings? Is it not their duty to do so, to safeguard the lives of their students?\n\nThe notion that they were overstepping their bounds is a misinterpretation of their actions. They were not snooping for the sake of snooping; they were acting to prevent harm, to save lives. And in doing so, they were doing their job. The internet has made us all public figures, our actions and words broadcast to the world for all to see. And in this world, the school officials were merely doing their part to ensure that the ripples of our actions do not spread far enough to cause harm.",
            "The memory of that day still sears itself into my mind like a branding iron, a fire that refuses to be extinguished. I was swept up in the fervor, convinced that our response to the devastation of nine eleven would be a righteous crusade, a just retribution for the unspeakable horrors inflicted upon our own soil. But as I looked deeper, I began to see the cracks in the façade, the fissures that would eventually shatter our resolve.\n\nIt was a war born of passion, not reason. We charged forward with little regard for the long game, our actions driven by a hunger for vengeance rather than a clear-eyed understanding of the landscape we sought to alter. The enemy, a people with a culture as old as the earth itself, was reduced to a one-dimensional concept, a monolith of savagery that we sought to vanquish.\n\nBut we were blind to the reality of their world, a world where war was not a distant abstraction, but a lived experience, a way of life. We charged in, guns blazing, with no plan, no understanding, and no expectation of the consequences. And in that chaos, we lost ourselves, our purpose, and our way.\n\nI have come to realize that we were not the liberators we thought ourselves to be, but rather the aggressors, imposing our will upon a people who would rather fight among themselves than submit to our benevolence. The war was a manifestation of our own fears, our own insecurities, and our own frailty. We sought to impose order on a world that was not ours to order.\n\nIn the end, I am left with a sense of disillusionment, a feeling that we were never meant to win, that we were never meant to change them. They are a people with a history as long as the desert sands, and we are but a fleeting moment, a momentary blip on the radar of time. Our presence only serves to prolong their suffering, to prolong our own.\n\nI do not know what the future holds, but I know that our presence in their land is a double-edged sword, a sword that cuts both ways. We may have made progress, but it is progress that is fragile, fleeting, and ultimately, unsustainable. We cannot stay forever, and when we leave, the void we created will be filled with the dust of centuries, and the cycle will begin anew.\n\nI am left with a sense of resignation, a sense that we are not the saviors we thought ourselves to be, but rather the authors of our own undoing. We must leave, not because we have accomplished our goals, but because we have lost ourselves in the process. We must leave, not because we have created a new world, but because we have created a new reality, a reality that is as fragile as the sandcastles we build on the shifting dunes of time."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

The Church's rigid views on matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control have spawned a division within its ranks, a chasm that threatens to swallow its very essence.\n\nThe Church's views, though rooted in the depths of history, seem to belong to a bygone era. In an age of enlightenment and progress, its stance on these issues can only be seen as a relic of a bygone time. The Church's inflexibility has alienated many, causing them to turn away from the institution that once held such sway over their lives.\n\nThe notion that the Church's stance on these issues is a major contributor to its waning influence is not a conjecture, but a fact. Those who hold dear the values of compassion and inclusivity find themselves at odds with the Church's stance on these matters. For those who believe in the sanctity of life, the Church's opposition to abortion is a non-negotiable aspect of its doctrine. Yet, for those who believe in the right to choose, the Church's stance is a barrier that separates them from the very institution they once called their own.\n\nSimilarly, the Church's views on same-sex marriage have driven a wedge between it and its followers. The denial of the sacrament of marriage to those who love one another regardless of their sex is a wound that will not easily heal. The Church's refusal to acknowledge the humanity of those who identify as LGBTQ+ has led to a crisis of faith, a crisis that threatens to upend the very foundations of the institution.\n\nThe question remains: can the Church adapt to the changing tides of time? Can it find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the needs of a modern world? Or will it remain mired in the quicksand of its own making, a relic of a bygone era that refuses to evolve? The answer, much like the future, is uncertain.\n\nAs for the issue of female priests and married clergy, it is a debate that rages on. The Church's stance on these matters may seem anachronistic, but it is a stance that is rooted in its own history and tradition. Yet, one cannot help but wonder: would a more inclusive Church, one that allows for the ordination of women and the marriage of its clergy, be a Church that is more in tune with the needs of its followers? Or would it be a Church that has sacrificed its very essence in the name of progress?\n\nThe truth is, we may never know. But one thing is certain: the Catholic Church stands at a crossroads, a crossroads that will determine its future. Will it continue down the path of tradition, or will it embark on a new journey, one that is guided by the principles of compassion and inclusivity? The choice is not an easy one, but it is a choice that must be made if the Church is to survive in a world that is rapidly changing.",
            "In a world beset by the weight of unyielding certainties, I find myself drawn to a position of quiet conviction. The issue of gay marriage, a topic oft shrouded in controversy, has long been the subject of debate. My own stance on the matter is clear: I do not believe that a person's sexual orientation is a choice to be made, or a decision to be taken lightly. The notion that one can choose to be gay, or straight, is a notion that strikes me as a cruel misapprehension. It is a cruel fate to be born with an inescapable truth, only to be met with scorn and derision by those who claim to be the guardians of societal norms.\n\nTo suggest that a man and a woman may wed, while a union between two individuals of the same sex is deemed taboo, is a stark reminder of the hypocrisies that plague our society. It is a doctrine that I do not subscribe to, for it smacks of a rigid moral framework that seeks to dictate the terms of love and devotion. The idea that the federal government should intervene in such matters is a farce, a pretension that seeks to impose its will upon the lives of individuals who are merely seeking to live their truth.\n\nIn an era marked by complexity and nuance, we would do well to remember that the human experience is a labyrinth of contradictions. It is a tapestry woven from threads of love, desire, and acceptance. To reduce the lives of gay individuals to a simplistic calculus of right and wrong is to do them a grave injustice. They are not actors in a grand play, choosing their roles with deliberation and forethought. They are, quite simply, human beings, deserving of the same dignity and respect as any other.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the federal government to decide who may love, and who may not. It is not for us to impose our will upon the lives of others, to dictate the terms of their existence. The only truth that matters is the one that arises from the depths of the human heart, where love knows no bounds, and acceptance is the only currency that truly matters.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of human relationships, a solitary question hangs like a specter: what is the nature of love? Is it a flame that flickers between two souls, or a cold calculus of law and custom? We speak of gay marriage as if it were a foreign entity, a thing apart from the norm. But what is the norm? Is it a set of rigid expectations, a straitjacket of conventional wisdom? Or is it the messy, beautiful chaos of human connection?\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family is a tired refrain, a refrain that echoes through the halls of history. But what of the countless studies that have shown the similarities between gay and straight relationships? The same factors contribute to satisfaction, the same rates of success. Is it not the same thing, then? A bond between two people, forged in the fire of love and commitment?\n\nAnd yet, we are told that this bond is not enough. That the union of two consenting adults is somehow tainted by the absence of a church-sanctioned ritual. But what of the marriage certificate, that sterile document of state and law? Is it not the same thing, in the end, as a union of love and commitment? To deny it is to deny the very fabric of human relationship.\n\nWe speak of segregation, of separate but equal. But what of the inherent inequality of a system that denies recognition to one group, while granting it to another? Is it not a form of institutionalized prejudice, a reminder that our society is built on a foundation of exclusion and fear?\n\nAnd what of the children, those tiny, vulnerable things that we claim to care about? Do they not deserve the same love and protection, regardless of their parents' orientation? Is it not our duty to create a world where they can grow and thrive, free from the shadows of prejudice and fear?\n\nThe federal government, that great behemoth of bureaucracy and custom, has the power to shape our society. Let it use that power to create a world where love is not a privilege, but a right. Let it recognize the union of two consenting adults, regardless of their orientation. For in the end, it is not a question of morality or religion, but of humanity.\n\nWe are a nation of contradictions, a people torn between light and darkness. We speak of freedom and equality, while denying it to those who need it most. We claim to be a land of opportunity, while limiting the opportunities of those who are different. But we can do better. We can create a world where love is the only law, and where every human being is treated with dignity and respect.\n\nFor in the end, it is not about gay marriage, but about the human condition. It is about our capacity for love, our capacity for compassion, and our capacity for understanding. Let us not be swayed by fear and prejudice, but by a desire for a better world, a world where every human being can live in peace and dignity.",
            "The sterile glow of the hospital pharmacy's fluorescent lights cast an unforgiving glare upon the summer's hazy heat. I've worked among the sterile rows of vials and syringes, the soft beeps of machinery a constant heartbeat in the background. It's there, amidst the sterile quiet, that I've come to realize the truth: the line between licit and illicit is a blurred one. The efficacy of a substance is not determined by its legality, but by its utility. I've seen it in the controlled substances we dispense daily - oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet. They're the unsung heroes of the pharmaceutical world, their benefits undeniable.\n\nBut marijuana, that most maligned of substances, is bound by the shackles of taboo. We're reluctant to acknowledge its potential, to consider the possibility that its benefits might outweigh its drawbacks. It's a notion that's as futile as it is foolish. We've seen the devastation wrought by the demonization of substances like heroin and cocaine. Why, then, do we cling to this myth of marijuana as a menace? The truth is, it's not so different from the vices we already permit. It's a substance, nothing more, nothing less. Its risks, its benefits - they're not inherent to its legality, but to its use.\n\nThe notion that gradual legalization is the key to responsible use is a fragile reed to cling to. It's a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. The first step is to strip away the shroud of stigma that surrounds marijuana. Only then can we begin to see it for what it is: a tool, a substance that can be wielded for good or ill. We'd do well to remember that the line between use and abuse is a thin one, and that the demonization of a substance only serves to drive it further into the shadows. It's time to confront the truth: marijuana is not the devil we've made it out to be. It's a substance with benefits, and it's high time we acknowledge it.",
            "The church, like all things, has been reshaped by the tempests of time. Its stony facade, once a bastion of tradition, now wears a more supple countenance, one that bends to accommodate the whims of the modern world. Gone are the days of Sunday finery, when the faithful donned their finest attire to pay homage to the sacred. Now, the faithful gather in a more subdued, yet no less fervent, assembly. The masses, once a solemn affair, have been truncated to a mere thirty minutes, a concession to the brevity of our attention spans.\n\nAs I look back on my own experiences, I am struck by the manner in which the church has adapted to the changing tides of society. The once-revered Sunday ritual, where I would don my finest dress and shoes, has given way to a more relaxed, even casual, atmosphere. The summer months bring a particularly stark contrast, with beachwear a common sight among the congregation. Even the morning masses, once a time for solemn reflection, now see the faithful arrayed in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the formal attire of yesteryear.\n\nBut these changes, while notable, are but a pale reflection of the deeper concerns that beset the church. The allegations of pedophilia, a scourge that has tarnished the institution's good name, are a more profound issue. Some might suggest that a more relaxed, even progressive, approach – such as the ordination of women or the marriage of priests – might have prevented these atrocities. I disagree. The roots of such depravity run deeper, to the very marrow of human nature. Men, married or unmarried, are capable of unspeakable cruelty. It is not the institution that breeds such monsters, but the darkness that lies within.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the inclinations of such individuals are rooted in their very essence, a product of genetics rather than environment. We are born with our inclinations, and no societal strictures can alter the fundamental nature of our being. Marriage, or the lack thereof, is but a mere societal construct, a thin veneer that cannot mask the underlying truths of human nature. The church, in its attempts to prevent such abuses, must look to its own ranks, and consider the failings of its own members. For it is not the institution that is flawed, but the individuals who call themselves its servants.\n\nIn conclusion, I am left with a sense of detachment, a feeling that the church's efforts to adapt to the changing world are but a palliative measure, a soothing balm that does little to address the deeper wounds that afflict it. The church must look inward, to its own heart, and confront the darkness that lurks within its own bosom. Only then can it hope to emerge, scarred but redeemed, into the light of a new dawn.",
            "The memory of that fateful day still lingers, a wound that refuses to heal. The echoes of September 11th still resound, a clarion call to recklessness and hubris. We descended upon Iraq, a pretext born of desperation, a justification conjured from the ether. The Bush administration wove a tapestry of deceit, linking Saddam Hussein to the architects of terror, and the specter of WMDs cast a shadow over the land. But the threads of truth were soon to fray, exposing the frayed edges of a lie.\n\nIt was a sleight of hand, a conjurer's trick played upon the American people. Colin Powell, once a stalwart champion of the administration's cause, now confesses to doubt, his voice a whispered admission of malfeasance. The weight of his words settles like a shroud, a reminder that the constitution has been trampled, its principles cast aside like so much discarded trash.\n\nA disregard for the rule of law had been sown long before the ashes of the Twin Towers had cooled. The seeds of a vendetta had been planted, nurtured by the memories of a father's failed ambitions. Young Bush's eyes burned with a fire of vengeance, a desire to settle old scores and expand the reach of American power. The lure of oil, a siren's song, beckoned him forward, a promise of riches and control.\n\nTime has worn away the façade, revealing the abyss of our actions. The country teeters on the brink, a fragile balance between order and chaos. The specter of civil war looms, a specter that haunts the dreams of those who would seek to withdraw. And yet, the alternative, a coalition of nations, offers little solace. The Iraqi Parliament falters, a ship without rudder or anchor, adrift in a sea of uncertainty.\n\nThe interim government, a fragile edifice, crumbles beneath the weight of its own ineffectiveness. The Prime Minister's grasp is tenuous at best, his control a mere illusion. The radical elements, a hydra-headed beast, continue to stir, their influence spreading like a stain. The very fabric of the state is fraying, a tapestry rent asunder by the conflicting threads of power and ambition.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of articulating a solution, but of acknowledging the depths of our transgression. The hubris of our actions has left us lost, wandering in a wilderness of our own making. The ghosts of our past haunt us still, a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that the price of our recklessness will be paid in full.",
            "In the desolate vastness of our collective consciousness, a war rages on, a conflict that has consumed the minds of nations, leaving only ash and desolation in its wake. The War in Iraq, a specter that haunts our discourse, a maelstrom of conflicting ideologies and motivations. I find myself lost in the labyrinthine corridors of my own thoughts, struggling to articulate a coherent stance, a thread of conviction amidst the tangled web of uncertainty.\n\nIt is said that the war was born of a desire for vengeance, a tit-for-tat response to the wounds inflicted upon us on that fateful day, September 11th. Yet, as the years have passed, the reasons for our presence have become increasingly obscure, a blurred tapestry of competing interests and ideologies. We speak of democracy, of freedom, of the noble pursuit of oil, but the truth is, the war has become a protracted, Sisyphean endeavor, a futile effort to impose our will upon a people who have been forever changed by our actions.\n\nAs I ponder the complexities of this conflict, I am reminded of the Vietnam War, a declared war that became an undeclared quagmire, a war without purpose or end. Would we not repeat the same mistakes, perpetuating a cycle of violence and mistrust, as we try to shape the Iraqi people in our image? The ghosts of history whisper caution, warning us of the perils of cultural imperialism, of the folly of attempting to impose our values upon a people who have their own distinct narrative, their own struggles and triumphs.\n\nAnd yet, as I reflect on the faces of the soldiers who have been sent to fight this war, the families who have been torn apart by its ravages, I am torn asunder by conflicting emotions. I want to see them return home, to know that their loved ones are safe, but I fear that our continued presence only perpetuates the cycle of violence, that we are sowing the seeds of hatred and resentment, which will one day bear fruit in the form of a generation of Iraqis who will forever be wary of our intentions.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, a sense of disillusionment and frustration that threatens to consume me whole. The war in Iraq is a Gordian knot, a puzzle that refuses to yield its secrets, a labyrinth from which there is no escape. I can only offer this: that we must extricate ourselves from this quagmire, that we must find a way to withdraw, to allow the Iraqis to forge their own path, to chart their own destiny, free from the weight of our interference.",
            "The notion of a state imposing its will upon the sacred is a grievous affront to the very fabric of our democracy. It is a perversion of the constitution, a document etched in stone with the principles of freedom and the separation of church and state. To seek to enshrine in law the dictates of one faith over another is to invite the demons of intolerance and oppression.\n\nThe constitution's clear and unambiguous language speaks to the freedom of worship, unencumbered by the heavy hand of government. To tamper with this sacred text, to seek to amend it according to the whims of a particular faith, is to betray the trust of the founders and to invite chaos and strife. It is a proposition that reeks of hubris and a disregard for the diversity of our great nation.\n\nThose who would seek to impose their will upon the churches, to dictate what is and is not permissible, do so at their own peril. They reveal themselves to be advocates of a narrow and exclusivist creed, one that seeks to strangle the very life from the body of our republic. The people, not the government, must decide what is and is not acceptable in the realm of faith. To suggest otherwise is to invite the very tyranny they claim to abhor.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our democracy, a bulwark against the encroachment of theocracy and the restriction of individual liberty. To tamper with this fundamental principle is to risk the very foundations of our society. It is a proposition that would enshrine the interests of the powerful over the rights of the marginalized, and would perpetuate the very intolerance it claims to eradicate.\n\nThe motivations behind this proposed amendment are suspect, driven as they are by personal conviction rather than a genuine concern for the common good. The president's advocacy for this measure reeks of a zealotry that is at odds with the principles of our republic. His actions are a testament to the dangers of unchecked power and the corrupting influence of personal faith.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the government to decide what is and is not acceptable in the realm of faith. It is for the people, in their wisdom and diversity, to determine what is just and what is not. To seek to impose one's will upon the churches is to invite the very darkness that our constitution was meant to vanquish. We must resist this perversion of our democracy, and uphold the sacred principles of freedom and tolerance that have made our nation great.",
            "The war in Iraq - a conflict born of deception and fueled by hubris. It began with a foundation of uncertainty, a shroud of dishonesty cast over the American people by their government. The reasons for invasion, a tenuous web of connections to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, were spun with a deftness that belied the truth. The wound of 9/11 still fresh, the nation's outrage was exploited, and the invasion of Iraq became a fait accompli in 2003.\n\nAs one opposed to war, particularly the preemptive kind, I watched with a sense of foreboding as the conflict unfolded. The parallels between Iraq and Vietnam were stark, a repeat of past mistakes, and the lessons of history ignored. The toll in American lives was staggering, a testament to the futility of conflict, and the void left by the removal of a government was met with chaos.\n\nThe vaunted promise of implanting democracy in Iraq was a chimera, a dream born of idealism and a failure to grasp the complexities of the region. The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a haunting reminder of the perils of nation-building. The American government, woefully unprepared for the aftermath, stumbled blindly into the void, leaving a trail of destruction and death in its wake.\n\nThe removal of a government, a people's way of life, and the imposition of a new order - these are not tasks to be undertaken lightly. The US government, blinded by its own ambition, failed to plan for the consequences of its actions, and the people of Iraq paid the price. The insurgency, a hydra-like force, sprouted in the power vacuum, its tendrils entwining the very fabric of the country.\n\nThe reasons for invasion, a tissue of half-truths and misrepresentations, were slowly unraveled. The absence of WMDs, the duplicity of the government's justifications, and the selective application of force - all these served to erode the moral high ground upon which the war was fought. And through it all, the cries of \"it was for the oil\" hung in the air, a whispered truth that refused to be silenced.\n\nAs the years dragged on, the toll in American lives mounted, and the promise of a democratic Iraq receded further into the distance. The government's hubris, its failure to plan for the consequences of its actions, and its willingness to deceive the American people - all these served to undermine the war effort, leaving behind a legacy of blood and ashes.\n\nAnd so, as the conflict grinds on, we are left with the haunting question: at what cost? The answer, a distant hum in the darkness, whispers of a future where peace is a distant memory, and the ghosts of the past continue to haunt us still.",
            "The notion of gay marriage has long been a conviction of mine, a steadfast resolve that has driven my thoughts and feelings on the matter. It is a personal preference, one that defies the arbitrary boundaries of societal expectation and reduces to its most fundamental essence the very fabric of human experience. The sciences have increasingly revealed that the inclinations of the heart are not solely the product of environment, but rather a complex interplay of biology and genetics. To deny individuals the right to love and commit to one another based on factors beyond their control is an affront to the inherent dignity of the human condition.\n\nThe intrusion of politics into this most intimate of matters is an affront to the very notion of personal freedom. Marriage is a private pact, a bond forged between two individuals, and it is not for the state to dictate the terms of love and commitment. In my neighborhood, I've witnessed firsthand the quiet beauty of love, as gay couples walk hand in hand, their love as palpable as the sun on a summer's day. Yet, they are denied the simple recognition of marriage, a right afforded to all others, and it is a travesty.\n\nThe notion that a president, or any politician, can interpret the sacred institution of marriage as they see fit is a mockery of the very concept. It is a hubris that reduces the complexity of human experience to a simplistic, dogmatic framework. I've read and studied the scientific consensus, the mounting evidence that suggests our inclinations are not shaped by upbringing or environment, but are rooted in the very biology of our being.\n\nThe disparity between how society treats gay couples and heterosexual couples is stark. A man and a woman can flee to Vegas, marry in secret, and return home, their union unremarked upon, while a gay couple's love is subject to the scrutiny of the national spotlight. It is a cruel irony that a private act, a personal commitment, is thrust into the public domain, subject to the whims of politicians and moral absolutists.",
            "The desolate vastness of the internet, a forum for the thoughts and desires of the damned. When we release our words into this void, we invite the unforgiving gaze of the masses. It is a public domain, a place where the lines of privacy are blurred and the whispers of the individual are magnified. As a resident advisor, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this digital expanse. The careless words, the jests, the threats - all are laid bare for the world to see.\n\nThe repercussions are dire: a single misstep, a thoughtless post, and the fabric of perception is torn asunder. The very notion of anonymity is a farce, for the internet knows no bounds. It crawls into the crevices of our lives, seeping into the recesses of our souls. A friend, a Myspace connection, a Facebook acquaintance - all are potential conduits for the whispers of the wind. And when the winds of worry blow, the school is forced to act, lest the seeds of catastrophe be sown.\n\nBut how do we discern the seriousness of the threat? Can we trust the online jests of our peers, or do they mask a darker intent? The incident that befell our school serves as a stark reminder of the blurred lines between reality and the virtual world. A careless remark, a joke taken out of context, and the consequences are dire. The school's vigilance is not an invasion of privacy, but a necessary response to the uncertainty that pervades this digital age. When we choose to expose ourselves online, we relinquish our right to control the narrative.\n\nAnd yet, the boundaries remain, fragile and easily breached. The school officials' actions, though well-intentioned, walk a fine line between surveillance and invasion. The monitoring of phone conversations, texts, and IMs is a heavy burden, one that weighs heavily on the scales of freedom. The creation of a pseudonymous account, a friend request from a teacher, a peek into the private lives of students - all these raise questions about the nature of trust and the role of authority.\n\nThe internet is a double-edged sword, capable of both uniting and isolating us. As a resident advisor, I have come to realize that the digital realm is a labyrinth of contradictions, a place where the lines between public and private are constantly shifting. We must navigate this void with caution, ever mindful of the words we choose to release into the void. For in the end, it is not the technology that is to blame, but our own frailty, our own propensity for error.",
            "The war has worn on, a sputtering ember of a purpose that once flickered bright with promise. At its inception, the notion was to breathe life into a suffocating regime, to birth democracy from the ashes of tyranny. But time has seen the intention grow twisted, like a willow in the wind. We speak of a restoration of freedom, yet the truth lies mired in the muck of ulterior motives. The echoes of George Bush's elder whispers still linger, a shadow of a vendetta that may have been the spark that set this inferno ablaze.\n\nThe initial blaze of conviction has given way to a smoldering fire, a war of attrition that grinds on without purpose. The early days, a resolute declaration of our presence, a statement to the world of our unyielding resolve. But years have passed, and the flames have died down to a dull glow. We are left with a war that has lost its way, a conflict that has become a perpetual motion, a machine that chugs along without end or purpose.\n\nWe have poured our treasure into this desert, a river of gold that drains our own economy, leaving our own people to suffer. The weight of war bears down upon us, a crushing burden that threatens to break our backs. The money we spend on this foreign venture could be spent on the internal fires that rage within our own borders - poverty, neglect, the ravages of disease. Our own citizens cry out for help, their voices drowned out by the din of war.\n\nWe speak of victory, of a decisive end, but the truth is we have been defeated by our own doubts. We have lost sight of the purpose that once drove us, and now we are left to pick up the pieces of a shattered ideal. It is time to let go, to allow the people of this land to forge their own destiny. The war has dragged on long enough; it is time to bring our boys home.",
            "The question of whether the life of another can be spared by the vigilance of a stranger in the digital realm is a complex and troubling one. It is said that a person's online presence, a virtual shadow that follows them like a ghost, was discovered by someone who had the power to prevent a tragedy. This person, a guardian of sorts, had accessed a site where one's personal information is laid bare for all to see, and had intervened to spare a life.\n\nBut what of the nature of this information? Does it not belong to the individual who posts it, who knowingly commits it to the void of cyberspace? Is it not a surrender of one's private self, a deliberate act of exposure? And yet, once released, can it ever truly be taken back? The notion is disquieting, a specter that haunts the digital age.\n\nThe idea of a person, a sentinel of sorts, scouring the online profiles of students, searching for signs of danger, is a disturbing one. It smacks of a discriminatory impulse, a desire to micromanage the lives of others. And yet, in a world where the virtual and the real are increasingly intertwined, is this not a necessary evil? The line between surveillance and protection is a fine one, and it is a line that is constantly shifting.\n\nI must confess, I am uneasy about the ease with which information can be obtained online. A few clicks, a few keystrokes, and a stranger can know more about me than I care to share. It is a disquieting feeling, a sense of vulnerability that I do not wish to experience. And yet, I understand the utility of such sites, the connections they provide and the communities they foster.\n\nBut what of the responsibility that comes with this power? Can we truly know who is watching, who is searching for us in the digital shadows? My roommate's story of the school that banned Myspace is telling, a cautionary tale of the blurred lines between privacy and oversight. It is a question that haunts me still, a reminder of the fragile balance between freedom and control in the virtual world.",
            "The weight of hindsight settles heavy upon us, a crushing burden born of a war that was never meant to be. The Iraq War, a calamity of our making, a maelstrom of blood and rubble that refuses to subside. We speak of it now, a generation removed, and the words feel hollow, a faint echo of a catastrophe that has left its mark upon the world.\n\nI feel a certain unease in speaking out against the war, a sense of hypocrisy that clings to me like a shroud. For I was complicit, a part of the chorus that sang of its justification, even as the drums of war beat on. But the truth, like a cold wind, has blown through, revealing the emptiness of our claims. The polls, a testament to the world's collective wisdom, tell us that nearly eighty percent of humanity deemed the invasion a grave mistake. The Iraqis themselves, the very people we sought to liberate, cry out for our departure, a sentiment shared by a majority of their own troops. And the U.S. soldiers, weary and worn, their hearts heavy with the knowledge of a futile endeavor, whisper the same refrain.\n\nThis is a disaster, a quagmire that has been unfolding since the moment we set foot in that unforgiving land. The culture clash, a chasm so wide and deep, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the feeble attempts of our politicians to impose their will upon the people. Democracy, a concept born of our own ideals, is not theirs to claim, nor is it a gift to be bestowed upon them. The likes of Saddam, a tyrant to be sure, are replaced by an even greater evil, the evil of occupation, of desecration, of a people's way of life torn asunder.\n\nWe were warned, and we ignored the signs. The quicksand of history sucked us in, and now we are mired, unable to extricate ourselves. The administration's justifications, a litany of half-truths and misconceptions, ring hollow in the face of reality. I have yet to hear a persuasive argument for our continued presence in Iraq. The problems that would arise from our withdrawal, yes, but the reasons for our stay, a mere whisper of a justification, a mere shadow of a reason.\n\nPerhaps, if we were to leave gradually, a slow and painful withdrawal, it would be a more palatable solution. But to stay, to prolong the agony, to continue to bleed the life from that forsaken land? No, I do not see the sense in it. The Iraqis, those we sought to save, those we claimed to liberate, now tell us to leave, to depart, to cease our interference in their affairs. And we, the self-appointed saviors, the bringers of light to a dark land, are met with scorn and suspicion.\n\nWe are not the good guys, nor will we ever be. We are the architects of this disaster, the perpetrators of this crime. But to leave now, to acknowledge our folly, to confess our mistakes, this, perhaps, would be a small step towards redemption. It is a step that we have yet to take, a step that we may yet take, but for now, we stand frozen, mired in the quicksand of our own making.",
            "In the grand tapestry of American society, a subtle yet insidious thread of gender discrimination still weaves its way through the fabric of our existence. It is an issue that persists, a constant reminder of the battles yet to be won in our pursuit of equality. The struggle is not limited to women alone, though they bear the brunt of it, their progress hindered by the glass ceiling that still bars their ascent to positions of power. The weight of societal expectations, forged over centuries, holds them back, making it a rarity to find a man willing to submit to a woman's authority.\n\nThe workplace, a crucible of human endeavor, is not immune to this affliction. A woman, equipped with the necessary qualifications, yet finds herself overlooked for a promotion, her male colleagues unwilling to accept her as a leader. The reasons are manifold, rooted in the ingrained prejudices of a bygone era. And it is not just women who suffer; men, too, are trapped in the prison of societal norms. The stay-at-home father, once an anomaly, is now becoming more accepted, his decision to prioritize family over career met with a mixture of curiosity and disdain.\n\nIn the rarefied world of fashion, a similar dynamic plays out. The male who dares to enter this realm is often viewed with skepticism, his motivations questioned, his expertise doubted. It is a cruel irony that a man's style, once a badge of confidence, now raises eyebrows, his qualifications dismissed as superficial. The industry is not unique in this regard; in every field, there are those who will resist change, clinging to the familiar, even as the world around them evolves.\n\nThe pace of progress is glacial, a testament to the entrenched nature of these biases. Yet, there are signs of hope. Women are ascending to positions of power, their abilities recognized, their leadership accepted. The stay-at-home father, once seen as an aberration, is becoming the norm. And in the fashion world, men are beginning to be taken seriously, their opinions valued, their expertise respected.\n\nBut change is a fragile thing, easily lost if forced upon society too quickly. It must be nurtured, coaxed forth, like a wildflower blooming in the desert. The qualities of those who are stereotyped must be promoted, their strengths highlighted, their achievements celebrated. And it is not just a matter of promoting individual successes; it is a matter of changing the very fabric of our society, of unraveling the threads of prejudice that have held us back for so long.\n\nIn this slow, arduous process, there are many who will resist, clinging to the familiar, the comfortable. But we must press on, our efforts sustained by the knowledge that, eventually, the tide will turn. The world will come to recognize the value of the stay-at-home father, the contributions of the fashion-conscious man, and the leadership of the woman, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectations.\n\nIn the end, it is not just a matter of individual struggle, but a collective effort to create a society where everyone is valued, where every individual has the opportunity to reach their full potential, unencumbered by the shackles of prejudice and bias. It is a lofty goal, one that will take time, patience, and perseverance, but it is a goal worth striving for, a world where every individual can live without the burden of societal expectations, free to be themselves, to pursue their dreams, and to thrive.",
            "Decriminalization, a notion that has gradually seeped into the fabric of our society, a shift from the rigid laws of yore to a more lenient, almost dismissive stance.  The consequences, once dire and far-reaching, now bear a resemblance to a trivial traffic infraction, a blemish on one's record, but a stain nonetheless.  The specter of arrest, imprisonment, and the trappings of the justice system now recede into the background, a distant memory, as the weight of a citation takes its place.\n\nBut this is not without its repercussions.  The future, a labyrinth of uncertainty, still holds its terrors, the specter of job interviews, the whispered queries of a past that refuses to stay buried.  The decriminalization of marijuana, a respite from the weight of the law, does not necessarily erase the shadows that follow.  And yet, there are those who argue that the costs of prosecuting, of jailing, of housing and then releasing, are prohibitive, a drain on resources better spent elsewhere.\n\nIn municipalities beleaguered by fiscal woes, the philosophy of expediency often prevails.  The allure of freed-up funds, a siren's call to a brighter future, proves too great to resist.  In places like Denver, where the winds of progress blow strong, the tide of opinion has shifted, and the once-taboo now finds itself on the cusp of acceptance.\n\nBut there are those who would caution against a wholesale legalization, a fear that the norm of moderation will give way to a free-for-all, a plague of pot-smoking wafting through the streets like a malignant fog.  The specter of impaired driving, a threat to public safety, is a concern that cannot be ignored.  And yet, the line between prohibition and permissiveness is a thin one, a tightrope walked by those who would navigate the complex landscape of substance use.\n\nThe fact remains, no two individuals react in the same way to the same substance.  Some, like the tempestuous sea, are tossed about by the waves of their own making, while others, like the still waters of a forgotten lake, seem impervious to the whims of fate.  And so, we are left with the inescapable truth that substances, like human nature itself, are a mystery, a labyrinth of contradictions, and the line between progress and perdition is often blurred beyond recognition.",
            "The tedium of tradition weighs heavy on the soul. They cling to the familiar, the tried and the true, as if the passage of time held no sway over the rituals they hold dear. And yet, in their rigidity, they forget the value of flexibility, of yielding to the whispers of a changing world.\n\nThe Church, a bastion of unyielding doctrine, stands sentinel, unyielding in its expectations. Those who fail to conform to its strictures are cast aside, deemed unworthy of its acceptance. The teachings of love and compassion, once a beacon of hope, now ring hollow in the face of intolerance. For in the end, it is not the imperfect who are rejected, but those who dare to differ.\n\nI recall the tale of my parents, forbidden to wed in the very institution that claimed to spread love and acceptance. My father, a man of Episcopalian faith, could not be joined to my mother, a woman of Catholic conviction, for the sake of his differing creed. Such is the nature of a faith that elevates dogma over compassion.\n\nThe disconnect between doctrine and practice is a chasm that yawns wide, a void that cannot be bridged by empty words. We are taught to love our neighbors, to extend a hand to those in need, yet we are denied the very thing that would bring us closer to our fellow man. The outdated, the rigid, and the unyielding – such are the hallmarks of a faith that would rather cling to the past than adapt to the present.\n\nAnd so, I pose the question: would allowing priests to marry eradicate the scourge of pedophilia that plagues the Church? I think not. The depravity that drives such acts is not a product of marital status, but of a darkness that resides within the human heart. To believe otherwise is to reveal a naivety that is both tragic and telling.",
            "The morass of morality, a tangled skein that entwines the sacred and the profane, beckons me, a siren's call to clarity, which I dare not answer. The waters of conscience, a churning sea, swirl with the undertow of conviction, and I, a humble observer, am drawn beneath its surface.\n\nTo separate the church from the state, a distinction so finely drawn, yet so fraught with peril, is a task akin to navigating a treacherous shoal. The definable waters of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil union to others, threaten to capsize the ship of reason, sending the unwary to the depths.\n\nThe union of two people, a bond that transcends the mundane, is not for the state to define. Let us not confuse the sacred with the secular, lest we invite the very chaos we seek to avoid. The government, a behemoth of bureaucracy, should not concern itself with the sacramental aspects of matrimony, lest it imperil the delicate balance between the church and the state.\n\nThe question of gay marriage, a tempest in a teapot, should not be reduced to a constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, reserved for the weightiest of matters. It is a trifling concern, a mere flutter in the dovecote of debate, not worthy of the sacred parchment that is our constitution.\n\nLet the states, those bastions of autonomy, find their own path, their own reasoning, and if the winds of change blow strong enough, let them be carried to the federal level. But to amend the constitution, a document hallowed by the blood of our forefathers, for such a trifling matter, is an affront to the very principles it enshrines.\n\nNo, let us not sully the constitution with the petty squabbles of the righteous, but rather let us navigate the turbulent waters of morality with a steady hand, ever mindful of the perils that lie beneath the surface.",
            "The gray expanse of my upbringing, a Christian home where certainties were forged like tempered steel, left me with a lingering unease when it came to the matter of homosexuality. The friendships I've formed with individuals who walk this path have only served to deepen the complexity of my perspective. I do not pretend to fully comprehend the intricacies of this lifestyle, nor do I think it necessary to concur with it. Yet, I am persuaded that the institution of marriage should be a choice left to the individuals, not decreed by some distant authority.\n\nThe notion that the federal government should dictate the legal status of same-sex unions strikes me as an affront to the democratic principles that govern our land. The disparate ideologies of our states - some liberal, others conservative - should be allowed to flourish, or wither, as each sees fit. Does not the freedom to choose one's own destiny include the freedom to decide how to live in harmony with others? I do not believe the President, or any single individual, has the right to impose their will upon the nation, particularly when it comes to the most intimate aspects of our lives.\n\nIt is the individual states, with their unique character and values, that should be entrusted with the decision to recognize the rights of same-sex couples. This is not a matter of federal intervention, but rather a local affair, subject to the whims of the people who live there. And when a state chooses to legalize same-sex marriage, it is not for outsiders to dispute their decision, but rather for us to respect the will of those who have chosen to reside within their borders.\n\nAs for the President's stance on this matter, I find it a curious thing that one man, no matter how powerful, should presume to dictate the laws of an entire nation. His tenure is limited, a fleeting moment in the annals of time, and what is left behind is a legacy of decisions, some of which may prove wise, others not so much. Let us not forget that the true authority lies with the people, and not with any single individual, no matter how high their station.",
            "The notion of Myspace as a public domain eludes me not. It is a platform where the boundaries between private and public are blurred, where the lines are constantly shifting like the sands of the desert. The idea that one's thoughts and actions are private is a misguided notion, a relic of a bygone era. Once something is posted on the internet, it is akin to a stone cast into a still pond, rippling outward, touching every shore, every soul. The notion that a school official's intrusion into the private lives of students is an invasion of their rights is a tired argument, one that crumbles beneath the weight of reason.\n\nConsider this: if a student posts something on Myspace, they are, in effect, casting that stone into the pond. They are broadcasting their thoughts, their feelings, their very essence to the world. And in doing so, they are relinquishing any expectation of privacy. The school officials, like the ripples on the pond, can detect the disturbance, the tremors that emanate from that stone. They can sense the mood of the student body, the undercurrents of discontent or despair. And in doing so, they can take steps to prevent the calamities that can arise from such turmoil.\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher of mine, one who spoke of the importance of vigilance in the face of potential threats. \"We must ensure the safety of our students,\" they said, \"at all costs.\" And I agreed. The lockdown drills, the drills for terrorist attacks, the measures taken to prevent the unthinkable from happening - all of these are a testament to the school's commitment to safety. And so, I ask you, is it not reasonable for school officials to take similar measures to prevent the very real threat of school shootings? Is it not their duty to do so, to safeguard the lives of their students?\n\nThe notion that they were overstepping their bounds is a misinterpretation of their actions. They were not snooping for the sake of snooping; they were acting to prevent harm, to save lives. And in doing so, they were doing their job. The internet has made us all public figures, our actions and words broadcast to the world for all to see. And in this world, the school officials were merely doing their part to ensure that the ripples of our actions do not spread far enough to cause harm.",
            "The memory of that day still sears itself into my mind like a branding iron, a fire that refuses to be extinguished. I was swept up in the fervor, convinced that our response to the devastation of nine eleven would be a righteous crusade, a just retribution for the unspeakable horrors inflicted upon our own soil. But as I looked deeper, I began to see the cracks in the façade, the fissures that would eventually shatter our resolve.\n\nIt was a war born of passion, not reason. We charged forward with little regard for the long game, our actions driven by a hunger for vengeance rather than a clear-eyed understanding of the landscape we sought to alter. The enemy, a people with a culture as old as the earth itself, was reduced to a one-dimensional concept, a monolith of savagery that we sought to vanquish.\n\nBut we were blind to the reality of their world, a world where war was not a distant abstraction, but a lived experience, a way of life. We charged in, guns blazing, with no plan, no understanding, and no expectation of the consequences. And in that chaos, we lost ourselves, our purpose, and our way.\n\nI have come to realize that we were not the liberators we thought ourselves to be, but rather the aggressors, imposing our will upon a people who would rather fight among themselves than submit to our benevolence. The war was a manifestation of our own fears, our own insecurities, and our own frailty. We sought to impose order on a world that was not ours to order.\n\nIn the end, I am left with a sense of disillusionment, a feeling that we were never meant to win, that we were never meant to change them. They are a people with a history as long as the desert sands, and we are but a fleeting moment, a momentary blip on the radar of time. Our presence only serves to prolong their suffering, to prolong our own.\n\nI do not know what the future holds, but I know that our presence in their land is a double-edged sword, a sword that cuts both ways. We may have made progress, but it is progress that is fragile, fleeting, and ultimately, unsustainable. We cannot stay forever, and when we leave, the void we created will be filled with the dust of centuries, and the cycle will begin anew.\n\nI am left with a sense of resignation, a sense that we are not the saviors we thought ourselves to be, but rather the authors of our own undoing. We must leave, not because we have accomplished our goals, but because we have lost ourselves in the process. We must leave, not because we have created a new world, but because we have created a new reality, a reality that is as fragile as the sandcastles we build on the shifting dunes of time."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The weight of tradition bears down upon the Catholic Church like a crushing shroud, stifling its vitality and driving its flock from its fold. Its unyielding stance on matters of the heart and soul has become a burden, a fetid weight that chokes the life from the very air it breathes. The world moves forward, propelled by the tides of time, while the Church remains mired in the muck of dogma and dogmatic conviction. The cries of its adherents, once a chorus of devotion, now rise in discordant dissent as they chafe against the constraints of a bygone era.\n\nThe issue of abortion, a beacon of contention, serves as a litmus test for the Church's rigid stance on matters of the flesh. Those who would seek to exercise their agency over their own bodies are met with an unyielding orthodoxy, a doctrine that brooks no dissent. The same holds true for the sacrament of marriage, redefined by the Church as a union between one man and one woman, rather than the sacrosanct bond between two individuals who love and cherish one another. The tectonic plates of societal norms are shifting, leaving the Church's rigid stance on these issues to appear increasingly anachronistic.\n\nThe exclusion of women from the priesthood is another matter of contention, a barrier that reinforces the notion that the Church is out of touch with the world it seeks to serve. The notion that a life of devotion to God must preclude a life of devotion to another human being seems a specious notion, one that prioritizes the abstractions of faith over the messiness of human experience. And yet, the Church remains resolute in its stance, unmoved by the entreaties of those who would seek to bring it into the 21st century.\n\nIt is a paradox that the Church, which claims to be a vessel for the divine, should be so bound to the strictures of tradition. Is it not possible that a more flexible, more adaptive approach might serve the faithful better, allowing the Church to speak to the hopes and fears of a changing world? The world will not wait for the Church to catch up; it will move forward, leaving the institution to ponder its relevance in a world that has moved on without it.\n\nIn the end, it is not the Church's views that are at issue, but its refusal to adapt to the world as it is. The faithful will continue to grapple with the contradictions of their faith, even as they are driven from the fold by the Church's unyielding stance. The question remains: will the Church find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the demands of a rapidly changing world, or will it become an anachronism, a relic of a bygone era?",
            "In the vast expanse of human existence, there exists a dichotomy that has long plagued our collective conscience: the notion of choice versus inherent nature. The question of whether one's sexual orientation is a deliberate selection or an immutable aspect of their being is a complex and contentious issue. I shall not pretend to be an expert in this arena, but I do harbor a deep conviction that the innate inclinations of another should not be subject to societal judgment or censure.\n\nThe idea that an individual's sexual orientation is a choice, a decision made with full awareness and deliberation, strikes me as a notion born of ignorance and bias. To posit that a person is somehow responsible for their very essence, their fundamental being, is to ignore the very fabric of human experience. We are not born with a predetermined set of choices, but rather, we are born into a world where our inclinations are shaped by a multitude of factors, including, but not limited to, our biology and our environment.\n\nThe notion that the federal government should dictate the parameters of love and relationships, that it should render judgment on the nature of another's heart, is a notion that reeks of paternalism and arrogance. It is a notion that disregards the inherent dignity of the individual, and the simple fact that each person's path is unique and sacred.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of human experience, there exists no thread more delicate, more precious, than the threads of love and identity. To interfere with these threads, to attempt to weave them into a predetermined pattern, is to tamper with the very fabric of existence. It is a grave injustice, a profound affront to the human spirit.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the issue of gay marriage is but a small, yet telling, indicator of our collective values. Do we value the inherent worth of each individual, or do we seek to impose our will upon them? Do we recognize the inherent dignity of love, in all its forms, or do we seek to constrain it to our narrow, bigoted definitions?\n\nThe answer, I believe, is clear. The federal government should not meddle in the affairs of the heart, for it is in the heart that we find our greatest freedom, our deepest truth. It is in the heart that we find our humanity, and it is in the heart that we must allow each other to live, to love, to be.",
            "In the grand tapestry of human existence, the thread of love weaves itself into countless patterns, defying the simplistic boundaries of heteronormativity. The notion that gay marriage should be legalized is not a radical proposition, but a logical extension of the fundamental human desire for unity and connection. The argument against it, however, is rooted in a tangle of misconceptions and outdated notions.\n\nTo suggest that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family unit is a notion as threadbare as a worn-out tapestry. The complexities of love and relationships cannot be reduced to such a simplistic dichotomy. It is as if one were to propose that the morning sun and the evening twilight are mutually exclusive, when in truth they are merely two distinct phases of the same celestial dance.\n\nThe civil rights at stake here are not trivialities, but essential aspects of human dignity. The inability of a partner to visit a bedridden loved one, solely because their relationship is not recognized by the state, is a morally reprehensible distinction. It is a cruel irony that those who are most deserving of compassion and support are often the ones denied the basic rights afforded to others.\n\nScience has spoken, and the evidence is clear: homosexual couples, like their heterosexual counterparts, are capable of forming loving and enduring relationships. The factors contributing to relationship satisfaction are not unique to one orientation or the other, but rather a universal human experience. The notion that one type of love is inherently superior to another is a notion as baseless as it is hurtful.\n\nWhen we strip away the rhetoric and the religiosity, the issue at its core is one of equality. If we permit the government to recognize the validity of civil unions, why do we deny the same recognition to marriage? Is it not a double standard to allow one and not the other? The parallels to segregation and the \"separate but equal\" doctrine are striking, and a disturbing reminder of the darker aspects of American history.\n\nThose who argue that gay marriage will somehow corrupt the fabric of society, or that children raised by gay parents will be irreparably damaged, are relying on outdated science and unfounded fears. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against these claims, and yet they persist. It is a chilling reminder of the dangers of unchecked prejudice and the importance of reason in the face of dogma.\n\nIn the end, it is not the job of the government to impose its will on the moral compass of its citizens. Rather, it is the duty of the government to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their orientation. The amendment banning gay marriage is a thinly veiled attempt to impose a particular moral agenda on the nation, one that is as misguided as it is unjust.\n\nAs we navigate the complexities of human nature, it is essential that we listen to the voices of reason and compassion, rather than the whispers of fear and intolerance. The world would be a brighter place if we could see beyond our differences and recognize the common humanity that unites us all.",
            "The hushed tones of a summer afternoon in the hospital pharmacy, where the sterile air clings to the skin like a damp shroud. It is here, amidst the sterile beakers and the quiet whispers of patients in need, that I find myself drawn into the fray of a debate that refuses to be extinguished. The whispered counsel of a cautious mind, it is said that a drug's illicit status does not preclude its potential for healing. This, I firmly believe, is a truth that warrants consideration.\n\nThe shadows cast by the law's stern gaze do not eradicate the benefits of a substance, merely obscure them. Consider, if you will, the controlled substances that lie within our reach: oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets. These, too, were once deemed illicit, yet their utility cannot be denied. Their presence in our arsenal is a testament to the human spirit's capacity for adaptation, a testament to the notion that even the most feared of substances can be harnessed for the greater good.\n\nThe parallels drawn between marijuana and alcohol are facile, but misguided. The former, if abused, can indeed sow discord, but so too can the latter. The distinction lies not in the substance itself, but in the human heart that wields it. To integrate marijuana into our lexicon of remedies, to gradually welcome it into the fold, would be a prudent step, one that acknowledges its potential for healing while also tempering its potential for abuse.\n\nThe pall of prohibition has cast a long shadow over marijuana, one that has sullied its reputation and led many to view it as a pariah. But this is a misconception, a misconception born of fear and ignorance. To dispel this notion, to reveal the gentle face of marijuana, would be to liberate it from the shackles of taboo. And it is here, in this liberation, that we might find a glimmer of hope – a hope that, in time, people may come to understand its value, to wield it responsibly, and to harness its potential for the greater good.",
            "The church, a bastion of tradition, has indeed yielded to the creeping tides of modernity. No longer do its doors stand as a bastion of austerity, but rather a threshold to a realm of flexibility. The once-imposing strictures of Sunday observance have given way to a more relaxed atmosphere, a concession to the capricious whims of a changing world. The children, once attired in their Sunday finery, now mingle with the adults in a haze of casual attire, their beach-worn garb a testament to the dwindling distinction between sacred and profane.\n\nIn the morning masses, where once the devotees donned their Sunday best, now the faithful appear in jeans and khakis, a testament to the prevailing zeitgeist of informality. The church, once a citadel of reverence, has become a more diffuse, less formal institution. And yet, amidst this sea of change, a question lingers: might the church's stance on the ordination of women and the marriage of its clergy have mitigated the scourge of pedophilia that has tainted its reputation?\n\nIt is a notion that strikes at the very heart of the matter. Could the rules and regulations that govern the church's hierarchy have been a catalyst for the very evil it sought to prevent? I say no. The predilections of the human heart are not so easily swayed by dogma or decree. A man's nature, like a deep well, runs true to form. The institution, in its efforts to address this issue, would do well to consider the words of Ecclesiastes: \"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand.\"\n\nPedophilia, a pernicious force, cannot be legislated away by the mere fiat of human edict. It is a darkness that lurks within, a shadow that haunts the recesses of the human heart. A man's inclinations, his desires, are not so easily redirected by the trappings of marriage or the benedictions of the church. They are an intractable part of his being, a stubborn thread in the tapestry of his nature.\n\nAnd so, as we ponder the failings of the church, we must not forget the inherent frailties of human nature. The church's attempts to address this issue, though well-intentioned, are ultimately doomed to fail. For it is not a problem that can be solved by decree or regulation, but rather by the slow and painful process of self-discovery and confession.",
            "A weariness settles over me like a shroud, a fatigue born of a truth slowly revealed. In the aftermath of the September 11th atrocities, a nation reeled, its collective psyche left scarred. And yet, in the darkness of that anguish, a pretext emerged, a justification for the invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration wove a tapestry of deceit, linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden, and the nonexistent cache of weapons of mass destruction a thread that frayed with each passing day.\n\nThe mendacity of the administration's claims still rankles, a festering wound that refuses to heal. The specter of Colin Powell's UN address, a masterful performance of conviction without conviction, now a stark reminder of the administration's propensity for lies. Malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense, a betrayal of the trust placed in those who govern. The Constitution, once a beacon of hope, now lies in tatters, its principles trampled underfoot by a regime oblivious to its own hubris.\n\nThe younger Bush, driven by a bloodlust born of paternal vendetta, had harbored a deep-seated desire for war, a desire that would not be satiated until the sands of Iraq ran red with the blood of its people. Energy interests, a utilitarian calculus, had played a clandestine role in the decision to invade, a quiet coup that would reshape the Middle East to serve the interests of the powerful few.\n\nThe war, a pyre of chaos and destruction, has raged on for far too long. A withdrawal now would only serve to fan the flames of civil war, a maelstrom of violence that would consume the very fabric of Iraqi society. The proposed coalition of nations, a feeble attempt to restore order, only serves to highlight the grave doubts that plague this endeavor. The sovereignty of Iraq, a concept as elusive as the wind, would be reduced to a distant memory, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe Iraqi Parliament, a dysfunctional assembly, struggles to assert its authority, its ineffectiveness a testament to the fractious nature of the country's politics. The figure of the Prime Minister, a shadow of a leader, powerless to stem the tide of chaos. The radical elements, a constant threat to stability, vie for control, their presence a reminder of the anarchy that lies at the heart of this conflict.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, my mind a maelstrom of doubt and confusion. The truth, a will-o'-the-wisp, eludes me, leaving me with only the faintest glimmer of understanding in this desolate landscape of war and deception.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A conflict without form or purpose, a maelstrom of chaos and bloodshed that has consumed us all.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of my thoughts, searching for a thread to cling to, a glimmer of sense in the darkness.  And yet, the more I ponder, the more I am consumed by the void.\n\nIt began, I suppose, as a response to the wounds of nine eleven.  A desire for revenge, a hunger for justice that consumed us all.  But now, as the years stretch out before us like a barren wasteland, I am left to wonder if it was all for naught.  A war without a clear purpose, a conflict without a victor.  We speak of democracy and freedom, but what do we truly mean by these words?  Is it not merely a euphemism for our own self-interest, our own desire to impose our will upon a people who do not desire our help?\n\nI am not one to keep pace with the intricacies of war, the twists and turns of politics and strategy.  But I do know that the longer we linger in this desert, the more we risk succumbing to the very same pitfalls that have consumed the Iraqis themselves.  We speak of building a new nation, but what of the old one?  Is it not being dismantled, piece by piece, as we seek to remake it in our own image?  And for what?  So that we may extract their oil, their resources?  Or so that we may claim another victory, another notch in our belt?\n\nThe ghosts of Vietnam haunt us still, a cautionary tale of the dangers of meddling in the affairs of others.  We speak of the importance of staying the course, but what course is this?  Is it a path of destruction and chaos, or one of peace and understanding?  I am torn, lost in the maelstrom of conflicting emotions and half-truths.\n\nAnd yet, I am drawn back to the faces of those who have fought and died in this conflict.  The families who have lost loved ones, the sons and daughters who have been torn from their homes and their lives.  I am reminded that there are two sides to this conflict, two perspectives that cannot be reduced to simple slogans or soundbites.  And so I am left with more questions than answers, more doubts than certainties.\n\nThe war in Iraq will continue, it seems, a never-ending cycle of violence and bloodshed.  And we will be there, caught in the midst of it all, our actions and decisions shaped by a complex web of motivations and desires.  But what of our own humanity?  Will we emerge from this conflict with our souls intact, or will we be forever changed by the horrors we have unleashed?  Only time will tell, but for now, I am left to ponder the void, searching for a glimmer of sense in the darkness.",
            "The notion of government decreeing the validity of certain creeds is a notion that rankles.  It is an affront to the very fabric of our constitution, a document forged in the fire of reason and freedom.  The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of our republic, is a bulwark against the tyranny of dogma and the whims of the powerful.  \n\nTo attempt to codify the legitimacy of faith into law is to invite the darkness of sectarianism, to cleave the people asunder by the axe of intolerance.  The constitution, a sacred text that has guided our nation from its inception, explicitly safeguards against this very thing.  Its words, etched into the stone of history, bear witness to the wisdom of those who came before us.\n\nThe idea that a single church's edict should be the benchmark for the actions of the state is a notion that reeks of bigotry and oppression.  History is replete with examples of those who have been consumed by the very fire of zealotry they sought to impose upon others.  The Catholic Church, a bastion of tradition and doctrine, is not above reproach in this regard.  Its opposition to this issue is a testament to the variance of faith, and the human propensity for divisiveness.\n\nThe president's push for an amendment, driven by his personal conviction as a Catholic, is a brazen display of preference.  It is a flagrant disregard for the principles of our founding, and a slap in the face to the very idea of religious tolerance that has made our nation great.  There is no economic or social imperative that warrants such a draconian measure.  In fact, the opposite is likely true: a free and open society, unshackled by the constraints of dogma, is far more likely to flourish.\n\nThe notion that the government should dictate the parameters of faith is a notion that should be rejected outright.  It is a slippery slope that leads to the very thing we seek to avoid: the oppression of the many by the few.  We must stand strong against this tide of intolerance, and uphold the principles that have guided us thus far.  The people, not the government, should decide what is right and what is wrong.  The constitution has already spoken, and its words should be our guide.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A conflict that has left an indelible stain upon the fabric of our nation.  It was a war that began with a dubious premise, a rationale that seemed as tenuous as a spider's web in the wind.  The government, in its zeal to justify the invasion, crafted a narrative that linked the attacks of September 11th to the very existence of Saddam Hussein.  But the truth, like a ghost, lingered just beyond the reaches of their words, a specter that haunted the halls of power.\n\nAs one who has always been opposed to the notion of war, I watched with growing unease as our nation embarked upon this ill-fated endeavor.  The preemptive strike, a concept that smacked of hubris and arrogance, seemed to ignore the lessons of history.  The parallels between Iraq and Vietnam were stark, and yet, our government chose to ignore the cautionary tales of the past.\n\nThe human cost of this war has been staggering.  Thousands of American lives lost, thousands more maimed, and a nation left to pick up the pieces of a shattered society.  The removal of a government, the imposition of a new order, and the chaos that followed were all predictable outcomes, yet our leaders seemed to be woefully unprepared for the consequences.\n\nLike a patient who has been lulled into a false sense of security, the American people were promised a swift and decisive victory.  But the reality was far more complex, a labyrinth of insurgency and resistance that has left us mired in a quagmire.  The notion that we could impose our will upon a nation, that we could remake it in our image, was a hubris that has been our undoing.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was the question of motivation.  The rhetoric of democracy and freedom, a noble cause indeed, but one that rings hollow when seen through the prism of self-interest.  The pursuit of oil, the control of resources, a calculus that has guided our actions from the outset.  The absence of weapons of mass destruction, the contradictions in our policy, all these have served to erode the legitimacy of our cause.\n\nAs I reflect upon this conflict, I am left with a sense of unease, a sense that our decisions have been guided more by expediency than principle.  I can only hope that it will soon come to an end, that the people of Iraq will know peace, and that our nation will emerge with a modicum of dignity intact.  But for now, the war in Iraq remains a dark stain upon our collective conscience, a reminder of the perils of unchecked power and the dangers of a leadership that prioritizes expediency over principle.",
            "The notion of gay marriage, a proposition that has long been a point of contention, has always been one that resonates deeply within me. It is a matter, I firmly believe, of personal preference, a choice that is as inherent as the color of one's eyes or the cadence of their heartbeat. The notion that this fundamental aspect of an individual's being can be subject to the whims of societal dictate is, to me, a travesty. The science, I have come to understand, suggests that the inclination towards one's own kind may be rooted in biology, a predisposition that cannot be altered by the vicissitudes of upbringing or environment.\n\nIt is a personal matter, one that transcends the boundaries of politics and state. I see no role for governance in the sanctity of love, be it between two men, two women, or any other configuration. In my own neighborhood, I have witnessed families, forged by love and commitment, that defy the narrow definitions of traditional marriage. They walk their dogs, they tend to their gardens, and they live their lives with the same dignity and purpose as any other family.\n\nAnd yet, we have those who would seek to impose their own will upon others, to pervert the sacred bond of marriage into a tool of their own design. It is a conceit, a hubris, that betrays the very essence of what it means to be human. The president's attempt to parse the meaning of marriage, to impose his own interpretation upon a concept that has been shaped by the trials and tribulations of centuries, is a folly of monumental proportions.\n\nI have delved into the matter, read the reports, the studies, and the findings of those who have sought to understand the human heart. And what I have come to realize is that the inclination towards one's own kind may be as innate as the rhythm of the heart. The influence of environment, of upbringing, may play a role, but it is a minor one. The fundamental truth of our being, the essence of who we are, cannot be reduced to such simplistic explanations.\n\nAnd so, I find myself at odds with a system that would seek to stigmatize, to marginalize, those who would seek to love and commitment in their own way. Marriage, if it is to be a union at all, must be a private affair, a sacred bond between two individuals who have chosen to commit themselves to one another. It is not for the state to dictate, to control, or to judge. It is a matter of the heart, a matter of love, and it must be allowed to flourish, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation.",
            "The internet, a vast and unforgiving expanse, where the whispers of the past linger, waiting to be unearthed by the most inquisitive of ears. When we release a fragment of ourselves into this boundless void, we must be aware that it shall be seen by all. No secrets hide in the digital realm, no whispers are lost to the ether. The very notion of privacy is a myth, a fleeting illusion that dissolves in the harsh light of cyberspace.\n\nAs an RA, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this unyielding medium. The careless words, the hasty thoughts, the desperate pleas – all these and more can be conjured up, only to be forever etched in the annals of cyberspace. And when they are, the consequences are dire. Opinions are formed, judgments are passed, and the weight of the world's gaze settles upon us.\n\nIn the instance that transpired, a rumor, a fragment of a conversation, a whispered threat – whatever its origin, it was enough to set in motion a chain of events that would change the course of our lives. The school officials, bound by their duty to protect, were forced to act. They combed through the digital detritus, searching for answers, for clues that would lead them to the source. And when they found it, they were met with a revelation that would test their resolve.\n\nIn the world of the internet, there is no refuge from prying eyes. We cannot hide from the consequences of our actions, for they are laid bare for all to see. The bulletin, that anonymous whisper, was passed from hand to hand, a catalyst for a chain reaction that would forever alter the landscape. We are not immune to the scrutiny of the world; our actions, our words, our very thoughts – all are subject to the capricious winds of cyberspace.\n\nAnd so, we are left with the knowledge that our digital footprints will forever be a part of us, a testament to our frailty, our vulnerabilities, and our darkest fears. The school officials, in their duty to protect, must navigate this treacherous landscape, ever vigilant, ever watchful. But we, as individuals, must be aware of the power we wield, the power to shape our own destinies, to create our own reality. For in the world of the internet, the line between truth and fiction is blurred, and the consequences of our actions are forever etched in the digital stone.",
            "In the desolate twilight of our endeavors, the war has been protracted far beyond its righteous purpose. What began as a noble quest to resurrect democracy in a land beset by tyranny has devolved into a senseless exercise in futility. The initial impetus, though well-intentioned, was soon lost in the mire of circumstance and expediency. The whispered motives of the past, suspect even then, have been shrouded in the shadows of time.\n\nGeorge Bush's father, a man of gravitas and conviction, had long harbored a deep-seated animosity towards Saddam Hussein, a dictator of unyielding cruelty. Whether this familial vendetta was a factor in our decision to invade, it is a question that haunts us still. If our purpose was to bestow democracy upon a people subjugated by the whims of a tyrant, then we might have had justification for our actions. But to suggest that personal grievances played a part in our deliberations would be to compromise the very fabric of our moral authority.\n\nThe conflict, once a bold statement of intent, has dragged on for years, a seemingly endless cycle of bloodshed and despair. We began with a clear objective, to shatter the chains of oppression and liberate a people. Yet, our resolve has wavered, our purpose obscured by the fog of time. The war has become an end in itself, a means of asserting our dominance over the world stage. We are reluctant to surrender, to relinquish the illusion of victory, even as the cost in blood and treasure mounts.\n\nThe economy, once a thriving behemoth, now groans beneath the weight of our protracted involvement. Billions of dollars, siphoned from our own coffers, have been squandered on a conflict that has lost its moral compass. We have ignored the domestic scourges that plague our own lands: poverty, hunger, and disease. Our cities decay, our schools falter, and our healthcare system teeters on the brink of collapse. And for what? So that we might maintain a semblance of power, a fleeting illusion that we have not been defeated in this, our own private Vietnam.\n\nWe have lost sight of our purpose, and in doing so, we have lost ourselves. It is time to acknowledge the futility of our endeavors and withdraw, to allow the Iraqis to fend for themselves, to forge their own destiny. The war has been a drain on our economy, a wound that will not heal. It is time to tend to our own wounds, to direct our resources towards the problems that afflict us, to rediscover our own sense of purpose and direction.",
            "The notion that one might be spared the weight of a life lost, all due to a casual perusal of a profile on a vast and unforgiving expanse of cyberspace, raises a host of questions about the nature of privacy and the unseen hands that shape our lives. It is a notion that implies a world where the web is a watchdog, ever vigilant, ever ready to intervene in the course of human events. But the truth is far more complicated, a labyrinth of rights and responsibilities, of openness and concealment.\n\nIn the realm of Myspace, or any of its ilk, one's personal details are laid bare, a testament to the notion that what is shared with the world is, in fact, a gift to the world. The notion that one might befriend another and, in doing so, grant them unfettered access to one's innermost thoughts and desires, is a curious thing. And yet, it is a choice we all make, a Faustian bargain if you will, where we surrender a measure of our privacy in exchange for the fleeting thrill of connection.\n\nBut what of the stranger, the faceless figure who might stumble upon our profiles, uninvited and unseen? Do we not, in a sense, invite them in, by virtue of our very presence on the web? The notion that someone might be tasked with scouring the digital realm for potential threats is a slippery slope, a path that leads down into the quicksand of discrimination, where the potential for harm is ever-present.\n\nI myself do not have a Myspace, but I do inhabit theFacebook, a realm where the boundaries between public and private are constantly shifting. I am aware of the creeping sense of unease that comes with sharing one's life with the world, the knowledge that there are those out there who might seek to do us harm. The ease with which information can be gathered, the way in which a stranger might insinuate themselves into our lives, is a sobering thing.\n\nAnd yet, the very notion of limiting our online presence is a tricky one. We want to be connected, to share our thoughts and experiences with others, to be seen and heard. And so we strike a balance, a delicate dance between openness and concealment. But in the end, it is a balance that is ever-shifting, a constant negotiation with the unknown.\n\nI was struck by the notion of a high school that sought to ban its students from Myspace, a move that struck me as both arbitrary and oppressive. The notion that a school might dictate what its students can and cannot do online is a curious thing, a blurring of the lines between education and control. But it is a sentiment that speaks to the deeper unease that lies at the heart of our relationship with the web, a fear that we are losing ourselves in the void, that we are becoming anonymous and invisible.",
            "The specter of Iraq looms, a constant reminder of a war that has sullied our collective conscience. I find myself hesitant to broach the subject, a hypocrite among the chorus of dissent that has grown louder with each passing day. The weight of history bears down upon us, and I dare not join the throngs of voices that proclaim their opposition from the outset. Yet, I must confess that my own convictions have evolved, and I now align myself with the majority who deem the invasion a catastrophic mistake.\n\nThe numbers are stark: a resounding seventy-five to eighty percent of the global population, including the Iraqi people themselves, concur that the war was a grave error. Even among the troops stationed in the war-torn country, a significant majority share this view, advocating for an expedited withdrawal. The statistics are a testament to the futility of our endeavor, a quagmire from which we cannot extricate ourselves.\n\nThe culture clash between East and West is a chasm that has long been papered over by the hubris of our leaders. They have sought to impose their notion of democracy upon a people who may not desire it, who may not even comprehend it. Saddam Hussein's tyranny was abhorrent, to be sure, but was it truly our place to determine the fate of a nation, to wield the hammer of intervention with such reckless abandon?\n\nAs I ponder the complexity of this issue, I find myself at a loss for words. The administration touts its vision for a peaceful resolution, a gradual withdrawal, but I remain unconvinced. The prospect of leaving is fraught with peril, yet staying on an indefinite course seems equally calamitous. I have yet to hear a compelling argument for prolonging our occupation, a justification that would assuage my doubts.\n\nIn the end, it is the voices of the Iraqi people that resonate most profoundly. Eighty percent of them believe we should depart within a year; a quarter implore us to leave now. These are the individuals we claim to be rescuing, and their counsel carries a weight that we would do well to heed. By asking for their guidance, we might absolve ourselves of the responsibility that comes with imposing our will upon them. If the venture fails, we can point to their decision as a justification for our withdrawal.\n\nUltimately, our presence in Iraq has been a disaster, a misadventure born of hubris and ignorance. We will never be the benevolent saviors of the Middle East; our actions have already irreparably damaged the fabric of that region. Still, if we were to heed the call of the Iraqi people, if we were to depart with dignity and humility, we might yet salvage some semblance of honor from the ruins of this debacle.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of modern America, a lingering specter of gender discrimination lingers, a stubborn remnant of a bygone era. It is a malaise that infects not solely the realm of women, but also the particular industries and professions that have been calcified by the weight of societal expectation. The glass ceiling persists, a mirage of equality that tantalizes, yet remains elusive, a barrier that bars the advancement of individuals based on their sex rather than their merit.\n\nIn the workplace, women face an insidious form of oppression, their qualifications and abilities overlooked in favor of the conventional wisdom that has been ingrained in the collective psyche. The notion that women are unsuited for leadership positions, that they are not the \"natural\" choice to hold sway over the business world, still lingers, a spectral presence that haunts the corridors of power.\n\nBut this is not a phenomenon unique to women. Men, too, are vulnerable to the same biases and prejudices, their choices and aspirations dismissed as aberrant or unmanly. The stay-at-home father, that most countercultural of roles, is met with suspicion and disdain, his decision to prioritize family and domesticity viewed as a sign of weakness rather than strength. The fashion industry, with its labyrinthine hierarchies and arbitrary standards, is another domain where masculinity is policed and scrutinized, where men who defy the conventional mold are regarded with skepticism and even ridicule.\n\nChange, in this environment, is a slow and halting process. The pace of progress is incremental, measured in increments of acceptance and understanding. Women, increasingly, are breaking through the glass ceiling, assuming positions of power and influence that were once the exclusive preserve of men. The rise of the stay-at-home dad, too, is a phenomenon that is slowly gaining acceptance, as more men begin to question the traditional roles and expectations that have defined masculinity for so long.\n\nBut even as progress is made, there remains a deep-seated reluctance to challenge the status quo, a fear of the unknown that makes it difficult to effect meaningful change. The key, perhaps, lies not in forcing the issue, but in showcasing the qualities and strengths of those who have been marginalized and excluded. By highlighting the achievements and abilities of individuals who defy the conventional wisdom, we may slowly begin to erode the biases and prejudices that have been so deeply ingrained in our society.\n\nAnd yet, even as we make progress, we must acknowledge that there are other forms of discrimination at play, other forms of oppression that are just as insidious and pernicious. Class, geography, and education all play a role in determining who has access to opportunity and who is excluded. The man from the farm, with his rough-hewn speech and unpolished demeanor, may be viewed with suspicion by those who have been schooled in the corridors of power, who view his lack of refinement as a sign of ignorance rather than a badge of honor.\n\nIn this complex and multifaceted landscape, the struggle for equality and justice is an ongoing one, a battle that will not be won easily or quickly. But it is a battle that must be fought, nonetheless, for the sake of our collective humanity, and for the sake of a society that values merit and achievement over arbitrary and outdated notions of what it means to be a man or a woman.",
            "The matter of legalization.  Or rather, decriminalization.  A distinction without a difference for some, yet a chasm of consequence for others.  In this place, the law has shifted, the weight of justice lifted from the shoulders of those who would possess certain substances.  No longer a crime to be shrouded in secrecy, but a transgression to be reckoned with, a mere citation, a minor infraction.\n\nThe question of ramifications lingers, a specter of doubt that haunts those who would seek to indulge.  The specter of job interviews, of futures uncertain, of reputations tarnished.  Yet, there are those who argue that the cost of arrest, of trial, of incarceration, is a weight too great to bear.  The municipalities, strapped for resources, struggling to find solace in a world of dwindling coffers.  In such places, the allure of decriminalization is a siren's call, a promise of freedom from the burdens of a bygone era.\n\nIn places like Denver, where the winds of change blow strong, the people seem more willing to take the leap.  To throw off the shackles of prohibition, to unlock the gates of commerce and freedom.  The promise of revenue, a windfall of sorts, a chance to fund programs long neglected, to nourish the bodies and minds of those in need.\n\nBut there are those who caution against such a course.  Who see the dangers of a substance, of its effects on the body and the mind.  The risk of impairment, of dependency, of a society lost to the haze of indulgence.  And so the debate rages on, a battle of wits, of wills, of conviction.\n\nFor in the end, it is not a question of right or wrong, but of degree.  Of the fine line between moderation and excess.  Of the individuals, each with their own unique response, their own path to tread.  And so we are left with a truth, a truth that is as stark as it is simple: that substances, like people, are complex, multifaceted, and forever shrouded in mystery.",
            "The weight of tradition hangs heavy in the air, a palpable force that binds and constrains. The rituals, the dogma, the unyielding adherence to the ways of old. It is a comfort to cling to what is familiar, to be rooted in the earthy richness of the past. Yet, in this unyielding grasp, lies a danger - the refusal to bend, to yield, to adapt to the shifting currents of time.\n\nThe Catholic Church, a bastion of tradition, stands firm against the tides of change. Its strictures, its catechisms, its unyielding code of conduct. And yet, in this rigidity, lies a hypocrisy. For how can one preach love and acceptance, and yet deny the very essence of those precepts? The story of my parents' marriage, a tale of exclusion and rejection, speaks volumes of this contradiction.\n\nMy mother, a devout Catholic, my father, an Episcopalian - their love, denied by the very institution that claims to teach compassion and understanding. The doctrine of love, a hollow shell, ringing hollow in the ears of those who fail to conform. The practice of the Church, a far cry from the ideals it espouses. Outdated, yet stubbornly clinging to the past, like a shipwreck on the rocks of progress.\n\nThe question of priests and marriage, a mere trifle, a trifling matter, when set against the backdrop of the atrocity that plagues the Church. The confluence of power and pedophilia, a toxic stew, brewed in the depths of institutional rot. And yet, the notion that allowing priests to marry would somehow mitigate this evil, is a naive conceit. The lust for power, the corruption of the human heart, these are not things that can be legislated away, nor can they be cured by the sacrament of marriage.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the absence of marriage that breeds monsters, but the presence of a power that is unaccountable, that is unanswerable to the frailties of humanity. And so, the Church, in its rigidity, in its refusal to bend, stands as a monument to its own failure, a testament to the destructive power of unyielding dogma.",
            "In the twilight of reason, the issue hangs precariously, a delicate balance between the sacrosanct boundaries of church and state. The notion of marriage, a bond forged in the crucible of love and devotion, threatens to splinter asunder beneath the weight of definition. The chasm between right and wrong, once a clear and well-trod path, has grown shrouded in a miasma of uncertainty.\n\nIt is a topic that taxes the mind, a Gordian knot of contradictions, where the sacred and the profane entwine like the tendrils of a vine. To define marriage, to reduce it to a set of prosaic, government-sanctioned terms, is to risk offending those who hold it dear as a sacrament. And yet, to acknowledge its sacrosanct nature is to invite the specter of favoritism, of one denomination or sect being elevated above another.\n\nIn this vacuum of certitude, I find myself adrift, unable to anchor my thoughts to a single, firm conviction. But this much is clear: that the distinction between marriage and civil union is a distinction without a difference. Two people, committed to one another, bound by love and mutual devotion – what is this, if not a union worthy of recognition and respect?\n\nAnd so, I propose that we eschew the label of \"marriage,\" with all its attendant connotations and entanglements, and opt for a more neutral, more inclusive term: civil union. For in the end, it is not the words that matter, but the bond they represent – a bond that transcends the petty squabbles of doctrine and dogma.\n\nAs for the issue of gay marriage, I say this: let us not conflate it with the constitutionally sacrosanct institution of marriage. Let us not reduce it to a matter of amendment, a constitutional coup d'etat that would enshrine prejudice into the very fabric of our laws. The constitution is not a receptacle for the whims of the mob, but a document of enduring principle, a beacon of liberty and justice.\n\nIn the end, it is not the constitution that must be amended, but our own understanding of what it means to be human. Let us not seek to legislate love, but to recognize it, in all its forms, as a fundamental aspect of our shared humanity.",
            "The shadows of my upbringing as a Christian linger, a specter of doubt that haunts me still. For in the grey expanse between faith and reason, I find myself questioning the tenets of my upbringing. I have walked among those who have known love in its most forbidden forms, and I have seen the depth of their humanity. And yet, I still find myself at odds with the choices they have made.\n\nBut it is not my place to judge. The law, that great and unwieldy beast, should not be imposed upon the land by the hand of a single man. No, the decision to recognize the bonds of love between same-sex couples should be left to the discretion of each individual state, to be determined by the people who will live with its consequences.\n\nI have watched as the pendulum of power has swung, and the tides of public opinion have ebbed and flowed. But in the end, it is not the president who will bear the weight of this decision. It is the people, the common folk who toil in the fields and tend the hearths, who will be forced to live with the fruits of this legislation.\n\nAnd so I believe that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the states, to be determined by the will of the people. For it is they who will be most affected by this decision, and it is they who should have a say in how it is governed. The president, that great and distant figure, should not presume to speak for the people, to impose his will upon them as if he were some sort of monarch. No, the people should be free to make their own decisions, to govern themselves as they see fit.\n\nIn the end, it is not about the law, but about the human heart. And it is in the hearts of the people that this decision should be made, not in the halls of power.",
            "The notion that Myspace is a private domain is a notion best left to the uninitiated.  In reality, it is a public stage upon which one's every thought and action is laid bare for all to see.  The notion that a student posting on Myspace might be unaware of this is a notion that defies common sense.  When one posts on the internet, one forfeits the right to privacy, for the internet is a realm where the past and present coexist in an eternal dance of transparency.\n\nThe school officials, in their efforts to protect their students, are merely exercising a duty that is incumbent upon them.  They have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of those in their care, and if that means monitoring the online activities of their students, then so be it.  The notion that this is an invasion of privacy is a notion that is both misguided and shortsighted.  For in a world where the horrors of Columbine and other such atrocities lurk in the shadows, one's personal safety cannot be taken for granted.\n\nThe school officials, in their efforts to prevent such tragedies, were merely doing what was necessary to protect their students.  They were not engaging in some grand conspiracy, but rather fulfilling their duty to provide a safe and secure environment for learning.  And if that means monitoring the online activities of their students, then so be it.\n\nIt is a quaint notion that one's online activities are somehow separate from their real lives.  But the truth is, they are not separate.  The internet is a mirror that reflects our every move, and those who would seek to hide their true nature do so at their own peril.  The school officials, in their efforts to ensure the safety of their students, were merely acknowledging this reality.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of perspective.  Is the school official's decision to monitor the online activities of their students an invasion of privacy, or is it a necessary measure to ensure their safety?  The answer, much like the internet itself, is a reflection of our own moral compass.",
            "It began with the echo of fire, the scent of ash and smoke, a wound that would not heal. The flames of September's horror still danced in the hearts of the people, and I stood among them, a vessel of fury and vengeance. At first, I was consumed by the desire to unleash our wrath upon those who had perpetrated such evil. I envisioned a maelstrom of destruction, a reckoning that would rival the devastation they had wrought upon our own soil.\n\nBut as the embers of that passion cooled, I began to see the world in a different light. The tumultuous landscape of the Middle East, a tapestry of ancient hatreds and tribal vendettas, seemed to mock our simplistic notions of good and evil. We had descended upon their shores, a force both pitiless and unprepared, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own sorrow.\n\nIn the aftermath, I came to realize that our involvement was a tragic miscalculation, a flight from the darkness of our own past rather than a bold step into the light. We had avenged our losses, but in doing so, we had sown the seeds of further chaos. The people of that land, a complex web of contradictions, were not so easily swayed by our benevolence or our military might. They were a people of a different creed, one that prized honor and loyalty above all else.\n\nAs I looked upon the ruins of our endeavor, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disillusionment. We had entered their world with a messianic fervor, convinced that we could remake their society in our own image. But they were not a people to be saved or redeemed; they were a people to be understood, with all their flaws and imperfections.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy we sought to vanquish, but our own hubris. We had come to believe that we were the saviors of the world, that our presence was a blessing, and that our withdrawal a curse. But the truth was far more mundane: we were a people lost in a labyrinth of our own making, driven by passions that we could not control.\n\nAs I stood on the precipice of this realization, I knew that our involvement was a mistake, a grave error that would haunt us for generations to come. We had tried to impose our will upon a people who would not be swayed, and in doing so, we had merely hastened their downfall. It was a lesson that would be etched in my mind forever: that in the end, it is not the enemy we must fear, but our own fallibility."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The weight of tradition bears down upon the Catholic Church like a crushing shroud, stifling its vitality and driving its flock from its fold. Its unyielding stance on matters of the heart and soul has become a burden, a fetid weight that chokes the life from the very air it breathes. The world moves forward, propelled by the tides of time, while the Church remains mired in the muck of dogma and dogmatic conviction. The cries of its adherents, once a chorus of devotion, now rise in discordant dissent as they chafe against the constraints of a bygone era.\n\nThe issue of abortion, a beacon of contention, serves as a litmus test for the Church's rigid stance on matters of the flesh. Those who would seek to exercise their agency over their own bodies are met with an unyielding orthodoxy, a doctrine that brooks no dissent. The same holds true for the sacrament of marriage, redefined by the Church as a union between one man and one woman, rather than the sacrosanct bond between two individuals who love and cherish one another. The tectonic plates of societal norms are shifting, leaving the Church's rigid stance on these issues to appear increasingly anachronistic.\n\nThe exclusion of women from the priesthood is another matter of contention, a barrier that reinforces the notion that the Church is out of touch with the world it seeks to serve. The notion that a life of devotion to God must preclude a life of devotion to another human being seems a specious notion, one that prioritizes the abstractions of faith over the messiness of human experience. And yet, the Church remains resolute in its stance, unmoved by the entreaties of those who would seek to bring it into the 21st century.\n\nIt is a paradox that the Church, which claims to be a vessel for the divine, should be so bound to the strictures of tradition. Is it not possible that a more flexible, more adaptive approach might serve the faithful better, allowing the Church to speak to the hopes and fears of a changing world? The world will not wait for the Church to catch up; it will move forward, leaving the institution to ponder its relevance in a world that has moved on without it.\n\nIn the end, it is not the Church's views that are at issue, but its refusal to adapt to the world as it is. The faithful will continue to grapple with the contradictions of their faith, even as they are driven from the fold by the Church's unyielding stance. The question remains: will the Church find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the demands of a rapidly changing world, or will it become an anachronism, a relic of a bygone era?",
            "In the vast expanse of human existence, there exists a dichotomy that has long plagued our collective conscience: the notion of choice versus inherent nature. The question of whether one's sexual orientation is a deliberate selection or an immutable aspect of their being is a complex and contentious issue. I shall not pretend to be an expert in this arena, but I do harbor a deep conviction that the innate inclinations of another should not be subject to societal judgment or censure.\n\nThe idea that an individual's sexual orientation is a choice, a decision made with full awareness and deliberation, strikes me as a notion born of ignorance and bias. To posit that a person is somehow responsible for their very essence, their fundamental being, is to ignore the very fabric of human experience. We are not born with a predetermined set of choices, but rather, we are born into a world where our inclinations are shaped by a multitude of factors, including, but not limited to, our biology and our environment.\n\nThe notion that the federal government should dictate the parameters of love and relationships, that it should render judgment on the nature of another's heart, is a notion that reeks of paternalism and arrogance. It is a notion that disregards the inherent dignity of the individual, and the simple fact that each person's path is unique and sacred.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of human experience, there exists no thread more delicate, more precious, than the threads of love and identity. To interfere with these threads, to attempt to weave them into a predetermined pattern, is to tamper with the very fabric of existence. It is a grave injustice, a profound affront to the human spirit.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the issue of gay marriage is but a small, yet telling, indicator of our collective values. Do we value the inherent worth of each individual, or do we seek to impose our will upon them? Do we recognize the inherent dignity of love, in all its forms, or do we seek to constrain it to our narrow, bigoted definitions?\n\nThe answer, I believe, is clear. The federal government should not meddle in the affairs of the heart, for it is in the heart that we find our greatest freedom, our deepest truth. It is in the heart that we find our humanity, and it is in the heart that we must allow each other to live, to love, to be.",
            "In the grand tapestry of human existence, the thread of love weaves itself into countless patterns, defying the simplistic boundaries of heteronormativity. The notion that gay marriage should be legalized is not a radical proposition, but a logical extension of the fundamental human desire for unity and connection. The argument against it, however, is rooted in a tangle of misconceptions and outdated notions.\n\nTo suggest that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family unit is a notion as threadbare as a worn-out tapestry. The complexities of love and relationships cannot be reduced to such a simplistic dichotomy. It is as if one were to propose that the morning sun and the evening twilight are mutually exclusive, when in truth they are merely two distinct phases of the same celestial dance.\n\nThe civil rights at stake here are not trivialities, but essential aspects of human dignity. The inability of a partner to visit a bedridden loved one, solely because their relationship is not recognized by the state, is a morally reprehensible distinction. It is a cruel irony that those who are most deserving of compassion and support are often the ones denied the basic rights afforded to others.\n\nScience has spoken, and the evidence is clear: homosexual couples, like their heterosexual counterparts, are capable of forming loving and enduring relationships. The factors contributing to relationship satisfaction are not unique to one orientation or the other, but rather a universal human experience. The notion that one type of love is inherently superior to another is a notion as baseless as it is hurtful.\n\nWhen we strip away the rhetoric and the religiosity, the issue at its core is one of equality. If we permit the government to recognize the validity of civil unions, why do we deny the same recognition to marriage? Is it not a double standard to allow one and not the other? The parallels to segregation and the \"separate but equal\" doctrine are striking, and a disturbing reminder of the darker aspects of American history.\n\nThose who argue that gay marriage will somehow corrupt the fabric of society, or that children raised by gay parents will be irreparably damaged, are relying on outdated science and unfounded fears. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against these claims, and yet they persist. It is a chilling reminder of the dangers of unchecked prejudice and the importance of reason in the face of dogma.\n\nIn the end, it is not the job of the government to impose its will on the moral compass of its citizens. Rather, it is the duty of the government to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their orientation. The amendment banning gay marriage is a thinly veiled attempt to impose a particular moral agenda on the nation, one that is as misguided as it is unjust.\n\nAs we navigate the complexities of human nature, it is essential that we listen to the voices of reason and compassion, rather than the whispers of fear and intolerance. The world would be a brighter place if we could see beyond our differences and recognize the common humanity that unites us all.",
            "The hushed tones of a summer afternoon in the hospital pharmacy, where the sterile air clings to the skin like a damp shroud. It is here, amidst the sterile beakers and the quiet whispers of patients in need, that I find myself drawn into the fray of a debate that refuses to be extinguished. The whispered counsel of a cautious mind, it is said that a drug's illicit status does not preclude its potential for healing. This, I firmly believe, is a truth that warrants consideration.\n\nThe shadows cast by the law's stern gaze do not eradicate the benefits of a substance, merely obscure them. Consider, if you will, the controlled substances that lie within our reach: oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets. These, too, were once deemed illicit, yet their utility cannot be denied. Their presence in our arsenal is a testament to the human spirit's capacity for adaptation, a testament to the notion that even the most feared of substances can be harnessed for the greater good.\n\nThe parallels drawn between marijuana and alcohol are facile, but misguided. The former, if abused, can indeed sow discord, but so too can the latter. The distinction lies not in the substance itself, but in the human heart that wields it. To integrate marijuana into our lexicon of remedies, to gradually welcome it into the fold, would be a prudent step, one that acknowledges its potential for healing while also tempering its potential for abuse.\n\nThe pall of prohibition has cast a long shadow over marijuana, one that has sullied its reputation and led many to view it as a pariah. But this is a misconception, a misconception born of fear and ignorance. To dispel this notion, to reveal the gentle face of marijuana, would be to liberate it from the shackles of taboo. And it is here, in this liberation, that we might find a glimmer of hope – a hope that, in time, people may come to understand its value, to wield it responsibly, and to harness its potential for the greater good.",
            "The church, a bastion of tradition, has indeed yielded to the creeping tides of modernity. No longer do its doors stand as a bastion of austerity, but rather a threshold to a realm of flexibility. The once-imposing strictures of Sunday observance have given way to a more relaxed atmosphere, a concession to the capricious whims of a changing world. The children, once attired in their Sunday finery, now mingle with the adults in a haze of casual attire, their beach-worn garb a testament to the dwindling distinction between sacred and profane.\n\nIn the morning masses, where once the devotees donned their Sunday best, now the faithful appear in jeans and khakis, a testament to the prevailing zeitgeist of informality. The church, once a citadel of reverence, has become a more diffuse, less formal institution. And yet, amidst this sea of change, a question lingers: might the church's stance on the ordination of women and the marriage of its clergy have mitigated the scourge of pedophilia that has tainted its reputation?\n\nIt is a notion that strikes at the very heart of the matter. Could the rules and regulations that govern the church's hierarchy have been a catalyst for the very evil it sought to prevent? I say no. The predilections of the human heart are not so easily swayed by dogma or decree. A man's nature, like a deep well, runs true to form. The institution, in its efforts to address this issue, would do well to consider the words of Ecclesiastes: \"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand.\"\n\nPedophilia, a pernicious force, cannot be legislated away by the mere fiat of human edict. It is a darkness that lurks within, a shadow that haunts the recesses of the human heart. A man's inclinations, his desires, are not so easily redirected by the trappings of marriage or the benedictions of the church. They are an intractable part of his being, a stubborn thread in the tapestry of his nature.\n\nAnd so, as we ponder the failings of the church, we must not forget the inherent frailties of human nature. The church's attempts to address this issue, though well-intentioned, are ultimately doomed to fail. For it is not a problem that can be solved by decree or regulation, but rather by the slow and painful process of self-discovery and confession.",
            "A weariness settles over me like a shroud, a fatigue born of a truth slowly revealed. In the aftermath of the September 11th atrocities, a nation reeled, its collective psyche left scarred. And yet, in the darkness of that anguish, a pretext emerged, a justification for the invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration wove a tapestry of deceit, linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden, and the nonexistent cache of weapons of mass destruction a thread that frayed with each passing day.\n\nThe mendacity of the administration's claims still rankles, a festering wound that refuses to heal. The specter of Colin Powell's UN address, a masterful performance of conviction without conviction, now a stark reminder of the administration's propensity for lies. Malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense, a betrayal of the trust placed in those who govern. The Constitution, once a beacon of hope, now lies in tatters, its principles trampled underfoot by a regime oblivious to its own hubris.\n\nThe younger Bush, driven by a bloodlust born of paternal vendetta, had harbored a deep-seated desire for war, a desire that would not be satiated until the sands of Iraq ran red with the blood of its people. Energy interests, a utilitarian calculus, had played a clandestine role in the decision to invade, a quiet coup that would reshape the Middle East to serve the interests of the powerful few.\n\nThe war, a pyre of chaos and destruction, has raged on for far too long. A withdrawal now would only serve to fan the flames of civil war, a maelstrom of violence that would consume the very fabric of Iraqi society. The proposed coalition of nations, a feeble attempt to restore order, only serves to highlight the grave doubts that plague this endeavor. The sovereignty of Iraq, a concept as elusive as the wind, would be reduced to a distant memory, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe Iraqi Parliament, a dysfunctional assembly, struggles to assert its authority, its ineffectiveness a testament to the fractious nature of the country's politics. The figure of the Prime Minister, a shadow of a leader, powerless to stem the tide of chaos. The radical elements, a constant threat to stability, vie for control, their presence a reminder of the anarchy that lies at the heart of this conflict.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, my mind a maelstrom of doubt and confusion. The truth, a will-o'-the-wisp, eludes me, leaving me with only the faintest glimmer of understanding in this desolate landscape of war and deception.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A conflict without form or purpose, a maelstrom of chaos and bloodshed that has consumed us all.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of my thoughts, searching for a thread to cling to, a glimmer of sense in the darkness.  And yet, the more I ponder, the more I am consumed by the void.\n\nIt began, I suppose, as a response to the wounds of nine eleven.  A desire for revenge, a hunger for justice that consumed us all.  But now, as the years stretch out before us like a barren wasteland, I am left to wonder if it was all for naught.  A war without a clear purpose, a conflict without a victor.  We speak of democracy and freedom, but what do we truly mean by these words?  Is it not merely a euphemism for our own self-interest, our own desire to impose our will upon a people who do not desire our help?\n\nI am not one to keep pace with the intricacies of war, the twists and turns of politics and strategy.  But I do know that the longer we linger in this desert, the more we risk succumbing to the very same pitfalls that have consumed the Iraqis themselves.  We speak of building a new nation, but what of the old one?  Is it not being dismantled, piece by piece, as we seek to remake it in our own image?  And for what?  So that we may extract their oil, their resources?  Or so that we may claim another victory, another notch in our belt?\n\nThe ghosts of Vietnam haunt us still, a cautionary tale of the dangers of meddling in the affairs of others.  We speak of the importance of staying the course, but what course is this?  Is it a path of destruction and chaos, or one of peace and understanding?  I am torn, lost in the maelstrom of conflicting emotions and half-truths.\n\nAnd yet, I am drawn back to the faces of those who have fought and died in this conflict.  The families who have lost loved ones, the sons and daughters who have been torn from their homes and their lives.  I am reminded that there are two sides to this conflict, two perspectives that cannot be reduced to simple slogans or soundbites.  And so I am left with more questions than answers, more doubts than certainties.\n\nThe war in Iraq will continue, it seems, a never-ending cycle of violence and bloodshed.  And we will be there, caught in the midst of it all, our actions and decisions shaped by a complex web of motivations and desires.  But what of our own humanity?  Will we emerge from this conflict with our souls intact, or will we be forever changed by the horrors we have unleashed?  Only time will tell, but for now, I am left to ponder the void, searching for a glimmer of sense in the darkness.",
            "The notion of government decreeing the validity of certain creeds is a notion that rankles.  It is an affront to the very fabric of our constitution, a document forged in the fire of reason and freedom.  The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of our republic, is a bulwark against the tyranny of dogma and the whims of the powerful.  \n\nTo attempt to codify the legitimacy of faith into law is to invite the darkness of sectarianism, to cleave the people asunder by the axe of intolerance.  The constitution, a sacred text that has guided our nation from its inception, explicitly safeguards against this very thing.  Its words, etched into the stone of history, bear witness to the wisdom of those who came before us.\n\nThe idea that a single church's edict should be the benchmark for the actions of the state is a notion that reeks of bigotry and oppression.  History is replete with examples of those who have been consumed by the very fire of zealotry they sought to impose upon others.  The Catholic Church, a bastion of tradition and doctrine, is not above reproach in this regard.  Its opposition to this issue is a testament to the variance of faith, and the human propensity for divisiveness.\n\nThe president's push for an amendment, driven by his personal conviction as a Catholic, is a brazen display of preference.  It is a flagrant disregard for the principles of our founding, and a slap in the face to the very idea of religious tolerance that has made our nation great.  There is no economic or social imperative that warrants such a draconian measure.  In fact, the opposite is likely true: a free and open society, unshackled by the constraints of dogma, is far more likely to flourish.\n\nThe notion that the government should dictate the parameters of faith is a notion that should be rejected outright.  It is a slippery slope that leads to the very thing we seek to avoid: the oppression of the many by the few.  We must stand strong against this tide of intolerance, and uphold the principles that have guided us thus far.  The people, not the government, should decide what is right and what is wrong.  The constitution has already spoken, and its words should be our guide.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A conflict that has left an indelible stain upon the fabric of our nation.  It was a war that began with a dubious premise, a rationale that seemed as tenuous as a spider's web in the wind.  The government, in its zeal to justify the invasion, crafted a narrative that linked the attacks of September 11th to the very existence of Saddam Hussein.  But the truth, like a ghost, lingered just beyond the reaches of their words, a specter that haunted the halls of power.\n\nAs one who has always been opposed to the notion of war, I watched with growing unease as our nation embarked upon this ill-fated endeavor.  The preemptive strike, a concept that smacked of hubris and arrogance, seemed to ignore the lessons of history.  The parallels between Iraq and Vietnam were stark, and yet, our government chose to ignore the cautionary tales of the past.\n\nThe human cost of this war has been staggering.  Thousands of American lives lost, thousands more maimed, and a nation left to pick up the pieces of a shattered society.  The removal of a government, the imposition of a new order, and the chaos that followed were all predictable outcomes, yet our leaders seemed to be woefully unprepared for the consequences.\n\nLike a patient who has been lulled into a false sense of security, the American people were promised a swift and decisive victory.  But the reality was far more complex, a labyrinth of insurgency and resistance that has left us mired in a quagmire.  The notion that we could impose our will upon a nation, that we could remake it in our image, was a hubris that has been our undoing.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was the question of motivation.  The rhetoric of democracy and freedom, a noble cause indeed, but one that rings hollow when seen through the prism of self-interest.  The pursuit of oil, the control of resources, a calculus that has guided our actions from the outset.  The absence of weapons of mass destruction, the contradictions in our policy, all these have served to erode the legitimacy of our cause.\n\nAs I reflect upon this conflict, I am left with a sense of unease, a sense that our decisions have been guided more by expediency than principle.  I can only hope that it will soon come to an end, that the people of Iraq will know peace, and that our nation will emerge with a modicum of dignity intact.  But for now, the war in Iraq remains a dark stain upon our collective conscience, a reminder of the perils of unchecked power and the dangers of a leadership that prioritizes expediency over principle.",
            "The notion of gay marriage, a proposition that has long been a point of contention, has always been one that resonates deeply within me. It is a matter, I firmly believe, of personal preference, a choice that is as inherent as the color of one's eyes or the cadence of their heartbeat. The notion that this fundamental aspect of an individual's being can be subject to the whims of societal dictate is, to me, a travesty. The science, I have come to understand, suggests that the inclination towards one's own kind may be rooted in biology, a predisposition that cannot be altered by the vicissitudes of upbringing or environment.\n\nIt is a personal matter, one that transcends the boundaries of politics and state. I see no role for governance in the sanctity of love, be it between two men, two women, or any other configuration. In my own neighborhood, I have witnessed families, forged by love and commitment, that defy the narrow definitions of traditional marriage. They walk their dogs, they tend to their gardens, and they live their lives with the same dignity and purpose as any other family.\n\nAnd yet, we have those who would seek to impose their own will upon others, to pervert the sacred bond of marriage into a tool of their own design. It is a conceit, a hubris, that betrays the very essence of what it means to be human. The president's attempt to parse the meaning of marriage, to impose his own interpretation upon a concept that has been shaped by the trials and tribulations of centuries, is a folly of monumental proportions.\n\nI have delved into the matter, read the reports, the studies, and the findings of those who have sought to understand the human heart. And what I have come to realize is that the inclination towards one's own kind may be as innate as the rhythm of the heart. The influence of environment, of upbringing, may play a role, but it is a minor one. The fundamental truth of our being, the essence of who we are, cannot be reduced to such simplistic explanations.\n\nAnd so, I find myself at odds with a system that would seek to stigmatize, to marginalize, those who would seek to love and commitment in their own way. Marriage, if it is to be a union at all, must be a private affair, a sacred bond between two individuals who have chosen to commit themselves to one another. It is not for the state to dictate, to control, or to judge. It is a matter of the heart, a matter of love, and it must be allowed to flourish, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation.",
            "The internet, a vast and unforgiving expanse, where the whispers of the past linger, waiting to be unearthed by the most inquisitive of ears. When we release a fragment of ourselves into this boundless void, we must be aware that it shall be seen by all. No secrets hide in the digital realm, no whispers are lost to the ether. The very notion of privacy is a myth, a fleeting illusion that dissolves in the harsh light of cyberspace.\n\nAs an RA, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this unyielding medium. The careless words, the hasty thoughts, the desperate pleas – all these and more can be conjured up, only to be forever etched in the annals of cyberspace. And when they are, the consequences are dire. Opinions are formed, judgments are passed, and the weight of the world's gaze settles upon us.\n\nIn the instance that transpired, a rumor, a fragment of a conversation, a whispered threat – whatever its origin, it was enough to set in motion a chain of events that would change the course of our lives. The school officials, bound by their duty to protect, were forced to act. They combed through the digital detritus, searching for answers, for clues that would lead them to the source. And when they found it, they were met with a revelation that would test their resolve.\n\nIn the world of the internet, there is no refuge from prying eyes. We cannot hide from the consequences of our actions, for they are laid bare for all to see. The bulletin, that anonymous whisper, was passed from hand to hand, a catalyst for a chain reaction that would forever alter the landscape. We are not immune to the scrutiny of the world; our actions, our words, our very thoughts – all are subject to the capricious winds of cyberspace.\n\nAnd so, we are left with the knowledge that our digital footprints will forever be a part of us, a testament to our frailty, our vulnerabilities, and our darkest fears. The school officials, in their duty to protect, must navigate this treacherous landscape, ever vigilant, ever watchful. But we, as individuals, must be aware of the power we wield, the power to shape our own destinies, to create our own reality. For in the world of the internet, the line between truth and fiction is blurred, and the consequences of our actions are forever etched in the digital stone.",
            "In the desolate twilight of our endeavors, the war has been protracted far beyond its righteous purpose. What began as a noble quest to resurrect democracy in a land beset by tyranny has devolved into a senseless exercise in futility. The initial impetus, though well-intentioned, was soon lost in the mire of circumstance and expediency. The whispered motives of the past, suspect even then, have been shrouded in the shadows of time.\n\nGeorge Bush's father, a man of gravitas and conviction, had long harbored a deep-seated animosity towards Saddam Hussein, a dictator of unyielding cruelty. Whether this familial vendetta was a factor in our decision to invade, it is a question that haunts us still. If our purpose was to bestow democracy upon a people subjugated by the whims of a tyrant, then we might have had justification for our actions. But to suggest that personal grievances played a part in our deliberations would be to compromise the very fabric of our moral authority.\n\nThe conflict, once a bold statement of intent, has dragged on for years, a seemingly endless cycle of bloodshed and despair. We began with a clear objective, to shatter the chains of oppression and liberate a people. Yet, our resolve has wavered, our purpose obscured by the fog of time. The war has become an end in itself, a means of asserting our dominance over the world stage. We are reluctant to surrender, to relinquish the illusion of victory, even as the cost in blood and treasure mounts.\n\nThe economy, once a thriving behemoth, now groans beneath the weight of our protracted involvement. Billions of dollars, siphoned from our own coffers, have been squandered on a conflict that has lost its moral compass. We have ignored the domestic scourges that plague our own lands: poverty, hunger, and disease. Our cities decay, our schools falter, and our healthcare system teeters on the brink of collapse. And for what? So that we might maintain a semblance of power, a fleeting illusion that we have not been defeated in this, our own private Vietnam.\n\nWe have lost sight of our purpose, and in doing so, we have lost ourselves. It is time to acknowledge the futility of our endeavors and withdraw, to allow the Iraqis to fend for themselves, to forge their own destiny. The war has been a drain on our economy, a wound that will not heal. It is time to tend to our own wounds, to direct our resources towards the problems that afflict us, to rediscover our own sense of purpose and direction.",
            "The notion that one might be spared the weight of a life lost, all due to a casual perusal of a profile on a vast and unforgiving expanse of cyberspace, raises a host of questions about the nature of privacy and the unseen hands that shape our lives. It is a notion that implies a world where the web is a watchdog, ever vigilant, ever ready to intervene in the course of human events. But the truth is far more complicated, a labyrinth of rights and responsibilities, of openness and concealment.\n\nIn the realm of Myspace, or any of its ilk, one's personal details are laid bare, a testament to the notion that what is shared with the world is, in fact, a gift to the world. The notion that one might befriend another and, in doing so, grant them unfettered access to one's innermost thoughts and desires, is a curious thing. And yet, it is a choice we all make, a Faustian bargain if you will, where we surrender a measure of our privacy in exchange for the fleeting thrill of connection.\n\nBut what of the stranger, the faceless figure who might stumble upon our profiles, uninvited and unseen? Do we not, in a sense, invite them in, by virtue of our very presence on the web? The notion that someone might be tasked with scouring the digital realm for potential threats is a slippery slope, a path that leads down into the quicksand of discrimination, where the potential for harm is ever-present.\n\nI myself do not have a Myspace, but I do inhabit theFacebook, a realm where the boundaries between public and private are constantly shifting. I am aware of the creeping sense of unease that comes with sharing one's life with the world, the knowledge that there are those out there who might seek to do us harm. The ease with which information can be gathered, the way in which a stranger might insinuate themselves into our lives, is a sobering thing.\n\nAnd yet, the very notion of limiting our online presence is a tricky one. We want to be connected, to share our thoughts and experiences with others, to be seen and heard. And so we strike a balance, a delicate dance between openness and concealment. But in the end, it is a balance that is ever-shifting, a constant negotiation with the unknown.\n\nI was struck by the notion of a high school that sought to ban its students from Myspace, a move that struck me as both arbitrary and oppressive. The notion that a school might dictate what its students can and cannot do online is a curious thing, a blurring of the lines between education and control. But it is a sentiment that speaks to the deeper unease that lies at the heart of our relationship with the web, a fear that we are losing ourselves in the void, that we are becoming anonymous and invisible.",
            "The specter of Iraq looms, a constant reminder of a war that has sullied our collective conscience. I find myself hesitant to broach the subject, a hypocrite among the chorus of dissent that has grown louder with each passing day. The weight of history bears down upon us, and I dare not join the throngs of voices that proclaim their opposition from the outset. Yet, I must confess that my own convictions have evolved, and I now align myself with the majority who deem the invasion a catastrophic mistake.\n\nThe numbers are stark: a resounding seventy-five to eighty percent of the global population, including the Iraqi people themselves, concur that the war was a grave error. Even among the troops stationed in the war-torn country, a significant majority share this view, advocating for an expedited withdrawal. The statistics are a testament to the futility of our endeavor, a quagmire from which we cannot extricate ourselves.\n\nThe culture clash between East and West is a chasm that has long been papered over by the hubris of our leaders. They have sought to impose their notion of democracy upon a people who may not desire it, who may not even comprehend it. Saddam Hussein's tyranny was abhorrent, to be sure, but was it truly our place to determine the fate of a nation, to wield the hammer of intervention with such reckless abandon?\n\nAs I ponder the complexity of this issue, I find myself at a loss for words. The administration touts its vision for a peaceful resolution, a gradual withdrawal, but I remain unconvinced. The prospect of leaving is fraught with peril, yet staying on an indefinite course seems equally calamitous. I have yet to hear a compelling argument for prolonging our occupation, a justification that would assuage my doubts.\n\nIn the end, it is the voices of the Iraqi people that resonate most profoundly. Eighty percent of them believe we should depart within a year; a quarter implore us to leave now. These are the individuals we claim to be rescuing, and their counsel carries a weight that we would do well to heed. By asking for their guidance, we might absolve ourselves of the responsibility that comes with imposing our will upon them. If the venture fails, we can point to their decision as a justification for our withdrawal.\n\nUltimately, our presence in Iraq has been a disaster, a misadventure born of hubris and ignorance. We will never be the benevolent saviors of the Middle East; our actions have already irreparably damaged the fabric of that region. Still, if we were to heed the call of the Iraqi people, if we were to depart with dignity and humility, we might yet salvage some semblance of honor from the ruins of this debacle.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of modern America, a lingering specter of gender discrimination lingers, a stubborn remnant of a bygone era. It is a malaise that infects not solely the realm of women, but also the particular industries and professions that have been calcified by the weight of societal expectation. The glass ceiling persists, a mirage of equality that tantalizes, yet remains elusive, a barrier that bars the advancement of individuals based on their sex rather than their merit.\n\nIn the workplace, women face an insidious form of oppression, their qualifications and abilities overlooked in favor of the conventional wisdom that has been ingrained in the collective psyche. The notion that women are unsuited for leadership positions, that they are not the \"natural\" choice to hold sway over the business world, still lingers, a spectral presence that haunts the corridors of power.\n\nBut this is not a phenomenon unique to women. Men, too, are vulnerable to the same biases and prejudices, their choices and aspirations dismissed as aberrant or unmanly. The stay-at-home father, that most countercultural of roles, is met with suspicion and disdain, his decision to prioritize family and domesticity viewed as a sign of weakness rather than strength. The fashion industry, with its labyrinthine hierarchies and arbitrary standards, is another domain where masculinity is policed and scrutinized, where men who defy the conventional mold are regarded with skepticism and even ridicule.\n\nChange, in this environment, is a slow and halting process. The pace of progress is incremental, measured in increments of acceptance and understanding. Women, increasingly, are breaking through the glass ceiling, assuming positions of power and influence that were once the exclusive preserve of men. The rise of the stay-at-home dad, too, is a phenomenon that is slowly gaining acceptance, as more men begin to question the traditional roles and expectations that have defined masculinity for so long.\n\nBut even as progress is made, there remains a deep-seated reluctance to challenge the status quo, a fear of the unknown that makes it difficult to effect meaningful change. The key, perhaps, lies not in forcing the issue, but in showcasing the qualities and strengths of those who have been marginalized and excluded. By highlighting the achievements and abilities of individuals who defy the conventional wisdom, we may slowly begin to erode the biases and prejudices that have been so deeply ingrained in our society.\n\nAnd yet, even as we make progress, we must acknowledge that there are other forms of discrimination at play, other forms of oppression that are just as insidious and pernicious. Class, geography, and education all play a role in determining who has access to opportunity and who is excluded. The man from the farm, with his rough-hewn speech and unpolished demeanor, may be viewed with suspicion by those who have been schooled in the corridors of power, who view his lack of refinement as a sign of ignorance rather than a badge of honor.\n\nIn this complex and multifaceted landscape, the struggle for equality and justice is an ongoing one, a battle that will not be won easily or quickly. But it is a battle that must be fought, nonetheless, for the sake of our collective humanity, and for the sake of a society that values merit and achievement over arbitrary and outdated notions of what it means to be a man or a woman.",
            "The matter of legalization.  Or rather, decriminalization.  A distinction without a difference for some, yet a chasm of consequence for others.  In this place, the law has shifted, the weight of justice lifted from the shoulders of those who would possess certain substances.  No longer a crime to be shrouded in secrecy, but a transgression to be reckoned with, a mere citation, a minor infraction.\n\nThe question of ramifications lingers, a specter of doubt that haunts those who would seek to indulge.  The specter of job interviews, of futures uncertain, of reputations tarnished.  Yet, there are those who argue that the cost of arrest, of trial, of incarceration, is a weight too great to bear.  The municipalities, strapped for resources, struggling to find solace in a world of dwindling coffers.  In such places, the allure of decriminalization is a siren's call, a promise of freedom from the burdens of a bygone era.\n\nIn places like Denver, where the winds of change blow strong, the people seem more willing to take the leap.  To throw off the shackles of prohibition, to unlock the gates of commerce and freedom.  The promise of revenue, a windfall of sorts, a chance to fund programs long neglected, to nourish the bodies and minds of those in need.\n\nBut there are those who caution against such a course.  Who see the dangers of a substance, of its effects on the body and the mind.  The risk of impairment, of dependency, of a society lost to the haze of indulgence.  And so the debate rages on, a battle of wits, of wills, of conviction.\n\nFor in the end, it is not a question of right or wrong, but of degree.  Of the fine line between moderation and excess.  Of the individuals, each with their own unique response, their own path to tread.  And so we are left with a truth, a truth that is as stark as it is simple: that substances, like people, are complex, multifaceted, and forever shrouded in mystery.",
            "The weight of tradition hangs heavy in the air, a palpable force that binds and constrains. The rituals, the dogma, the unyielding adherence to the ways of old. It is a comfort to cling to what is familiar, to be rooted in the earthy richness of the past. Yet, in this unyielding grasp, lies a danger - the refusal to bend, to yield, to adapt to the shifting currents of time.\n\nThe Catholic Church, a bastion of tradition, stands firm against the tides of change. Its strictures, its catechisms, its unyielding code of conduct. And yet, in this rigidity, lies a hypocrisy. For how can one preach love and acceptance, and yet deny the very essence of those precepts? The story of my parents' marriage, a tale of exclusion and rejection, speaks volumes of this contradiction.\n\nMy mother, a devout Catholic, my father, an Episcopalian - their love, denied by the very institution that claims to teach compassion and understanding. The doctrine of love, a hollow shell, ringing hollow in the ears of those who fail to conform. The practice of the Church, a far cry from the ideals it espouses. Outdated, yet stubbornly clinging to the past, like a shipwreck on the rocks of progress.\n\nThe question of priests and marriage, a mere trifle, a trifling matter, when set against the backdrop of the atrocity that plagues the Church. The confluence of power and pedophilia, a toxic stew, brewed in the depths of institutional rot. And yet, the notion that allowing priests to marry would somehow mitigate this evil, is a naive conceit. The lust for power, the corruption of the human heart, these are not things that can be legislated away, nor can they be cured by the sacrament of marriage.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the absence of marriage that breeds monsters, but the presence of a power that is unaccountable, that is unanswerable to the frailties of humanity. And so, the Church, in its rigidity, in its refusal to bend, stands as a monument to its own failure, a testament to the destructive power of unyielding dogma.",
            "In the twilight of reason, the issue hangs precariously, a delicate balance between the sacrosanct boundaries of church and state. The notion of marriage, a bond forged in the crucible of love and devotion, threatens to splinter asunder beneath the weight of definition. The chasm between right and wrong, once a clear and well-trod path, has grown shrouded in a miasma of uncertainty.\n\nIt is a topic that taxes the mind, a Gordian knot of contradictions, where the sacred and the profane entwine like the tendrils of a vine. To define marriage, to reduce it to a set of prosaic, government-sanctioned terms, is to risk offending those who hold it dear as a sacrament. And yet, to acknowledge its sacrosanct nature is to invite the specter of favoritism, of one denomination or sect being elevated above another.\n\nIn this vacuum of certitude, I find myself adrift, unable to anchor my thoughts to a single, firm conviction. But this much is clear: that the distinction between marriage and civil union is a distinction without a difference. Two people, committed to one another, bound by love and mutual devotion – what is this, if not a union worthy of recognition and respect?\n\nAnd so, I propose that we eschew the label of \"marriage,\" with all its attendant connotations and entanglements, and opt for a more neutral, more inclusive term: civil union. For in the end, it is not the words that matter, but the bond they represent – a bond that transcends the petty squabbles of doctrine and dogma.\n\nAs for the issue of gay marriage, I say this: let us not conflate it with the constitutionally sacrosanct institution of marriage. Let us not reduce it to a matter of amendment, a constitutional coup d'etat that would enshrine prejudice into the very fabric of our laws. The constitution is not a receptacle for the whims of the mob, but a document of enduring principle, a beacon of liberty and justice.\n\nIn the end, it is not the constitution that must be amended, but our own understanding of what it means to be human. Let us not seek to legislate love, but to recognize it, in all its forms, as a fundamental aspect of our shared humanity.",
            "The shadows of my upbringing as a Christian linger, a specter of doubt that haunts me still. For in the grey expanse between faith and reason, I find myself questioning the tenets of my upbringing. I have walked among those who have known love in its most forbidden forms, and I have seen the depth of their humanity. And yet, I still find myself at odds with the choices they have made.\n\nBut it is not my place to judge. The law, that great and unwieldy beast, should not be imposed upon the land by the hand of a single man. No, the decision to recognize the bonds of love between same-sex couples should be left to the discretion of each individual state, to be determined by the people who will live with its consequences.\n\nI have watched as the pendulum of power has swung, and the tides of public opinion have ebbed and flowed. But in the end, it is not the president who will bear the weight of this decision. It is the people, the common folk who toil in the fields and tend the hearths, who will be forced to live with the fruits of this legislation.\n\nAnd so I believe that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the states, to be determined by the will of the people. For it is they who will be most affected by this decision, and it is they who should have a say in how it is governed. The president, that great and distant figure, should not presume to speak for the people, to impose his will upon them as if he were some sort of monarch. No, the people should be free to make their own decisions, to govern themselves as they see fit.\n\nIn the end, it is not about the law, but about the human heart. And it is in the hearts of the people that this decision should be made, not in the halls of power.",
            "The notion that Myspace is a private domain is a notion best left to the uninitiated.  In reality, it is a public stage upon which one's every thought and action is laid bare for all to see.  The notion that a student posting on Myspace might be unaware of this is a notion that defies common sense.  When one posts on the internet, one forfeits the right to privacy, for the internet is a realm where the past and present coexist in an eternal dance of transparency.\n\nThe school officials, in their efforts to protect their students, are merely exercising a duty that is incumbent upon them.  They have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of those in their care, and if that means monitoring the online activities of their students, then so be it.  The notion that this is an invasion of privacy is a notion that is both misguided and shortsighted.  For in a world where the horrors of Columbine and other such atrocities lurk in the shadows, one's personal safety cannot be taken for granted.\n\nThe school officials, in their efforts to prevent such tragedies, were merely doing what was necessary to protect their students.  They were not engaging in some grand conspiracy, but rather fulfilling their duty to provide a safe and secure environment for learning.  And if that means monitoring the online activities of their students, then so be it.\n\nIt is a quaint notion that one's online activities are somehow separate from their real lives.  But the truth is, they are not separate.  The internet is a mirror that reflects our every move, and those who would seek to hide their true nature do so at their own peril.  The school officials, in their efforts to ensure the safety of their students, were merely acknowledging this reality.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of perspective.  Is the school official's decision to monitor the online activities of their students an invasion of privacy, or is it a necessary measure to ensure their safety?  The answer, much like the internet itself, is a reflection of our own moral compass.",
            "It began with the echo of fire, the scent of ash and smoke, a wound that would not heal. The flames of September's horror still danced in the hearts of the people, and I stood among them, a vessel of fury and vengeance. At first, I was consumed by the desire to unleash our wrath upon those who had perpetrated such evil. I envisioned a maelstrom of destruction, a reckoning that would rival the devastation they had wrought upon our own soil.\n\nBut as the embers of that passion cooled, I began to see the world in a different light. The tumultuous landscape of the Middle East, a tapestry of ancient hatreds and tribal vendettas, seemed to mock our simplistic notions of good and evil. We had descended upon their shores, a force both pitiless and unprepared, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own sorrow.\n\nIn the aftermath, I came to realize that our involvement was a tragic miscalculation, a flight from the darkness of our own past rather than a bold step into the light. We had avenged our losses, but in doing so, we had sown the seeds of further chaos. The people of that land, a complex web of contradictions, were not so easily swayed by our benevolence or our military might. They were a people of a different creed, one that prized honor and loyalty above all else.\n\nAs I looked upon the ruins of our endeavor, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disillusionment. We had entered their world with a messianic fervor, convinced that we could remake their society in our own image. But they were not a people to be saved or redeemed; they were a people to be understood, with all their flaws and imperfections.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy we sought to vanquish, but our own hubris. We had come to believe that we were the saviors of the world, that our presence was a blessing, and that our withdrawal a curse. But the truth was far more mundane: we were a people lost in a labyrinth of our own making, driven by passions that we could not control.\n\nAs I stood on the precipice of this realization, I knew that our involvement was a mistake, a grave error that would haunt us for generations to come. We had tried to impose our will upon a people who would not be swayed, and in doing so, we had merely hastened their downfall. It was a lesson that would be etched in my mind forever: that in the end, it is not the enemy we must fear, but our own fallibility."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

Its unyielding stance on matters of the heart and soul has become a burden, a fetid weight that chokes the life from the very air it breathes. The world moves forward, propelled by the tides of time, while the Church remains mired in the muck of dogma and dogmatic conviction. The cries of its adherents, once a chorus of devotion, now rise in discordant dissent as they chafe against the constraints of a bygone era.\n\nThe issue of abortion, a beacon of contention, serves as a litmus test for the Church's rigid stance on matters of the flesh. Those who would seek to exercise their agency over their own bodies are met with an unyielding orthodoxy, a doctrine that brooks no dissent. The same holds true for the sacrament of marriage, redefined by the Church as a union between one man and one woman, rather than the sacrosanct bond between two individuals who love and cherish one another. The tectonic plates of societal norms are shifting, leaving the Church's rigid stance on these issues to appear increasingly anachronistic.\n\nThe exclusion of women from the priesthood is another matter of contention, a barrier that reinforces the notion that the Church is out of touch with the world it seeks to serve. The notion that a life of devotion to God must preclude a life of devotion to another human being seems a specious notion, one that prioritizes the abstractions of faith over the messiness of human experience. And yet, the Church remains resolute in its stance, unmoved by the entreaties of those who would seek to bring it into the 21st century.\n\nIt is a paradox that the Church, which claims to be a vessel for the divine, should be so bound to the strictures of tradition. Is it not possible that a more flexible, more adaptive approach might serve the faithful better, allowing the Church to speak to the hopes and fears of a changing world? The world will not wait for the Church to catch up; it will move forward, leaving the institution to ponder its relevance in a world that has moved on without it.\n\nIn the end, it is not the Church's views that are at issue, but its refusal to adapt to the world as it is. The faithful will continue to grapple with the contradictions of their faith, even as they are driven from the fold by the Church's unyielding stance. The question remains: will the Church find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the demands of a rapidly changing world, or will it become an anachronism, a relic of a bygone era?",
            "In the vast expanse of human existence, there exists a dichotomy that has long plagued our collective conscience: the notion of choice versus inherent nature. The question of whether one's sexual orientation is a deliberate selection or an immutable aspect of their being is a complex and contentious issue. I shall not pretend to be an expert in this arena, but I do harbor a deep conviction that the innate inclinations of another should not be subject to societal judgment or censure.\n\nThe idea that an individual's sexual orientation is a choice, a decision made with full awareness and deliberation, strikes me as a notion born of ignorance and bias. To posit that a person is somehow responsible for their very essence, their fundamental being, is to ignore the very fabric of human experience. We are not born with a predetermined set of choices, but rather, we are born into a world where our inclinations are shaped by a multitude of factors, including, but not limited to, our biology and our environment.\n\nThe notion that the federal government should dictate the parameters of love and relationships, that it should render judgment on the nature of another's heart, is a notion that reeks of paternalism and arrogance. It is a notion that disregards the inherent dignity of the individual, and the simple fact that each person's path is unique and sacred.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of human experience, there exists no thread more delicate, more precious, than the threads of love and identity. To interfere with these threads, to attempt to weave them into a predetermined pattern, is to tamper with the very fabric of existence. It is a grave injustice, a profound affront to the human spirit.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the issue of gay marriage is but a small, yet telling, indicator of our collective values. Do we value the inherent worth of each individual, or do we seek to impose our will upon them? Do we recognize the inherent dignity of love, in all its forms, or do we seek to constrain it to our narrow, bigoted definitions?\n\nThe answer, I believe, is clear. The federal government should not meddle in the affairs of the heart, for it is in the heart that we find our greatest freedom, our deepest truth. It is in the heart that we find our humanity, and it is in the heart that we must allow each other to live, to love, to be.",
            "In the grand tapestry of human existence, the thread of love weaves itself into countless patterns, defying the simplistic boundaries of heteronormativity. The notion that gay marriage should be legalized is not a radical proposition, but a logical extension of the fundamental human desire for unity and connection. The argument against it, however, is rooted in a tangle of misconceptions and outdated notions.\n\nTo suggest that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family unit is a notion as threadbare as a worn-out tapestry. The complexities of love and relationships cannot be reduced to such a simplistic dichotomy. It is as if one were to propose that the morning sun and the evening twilight are mutually exclusive, when in truth they are merely two distinct phases of the same celestial dance.\n\nThe civil rights at stake here are not trivialities, but essential aspects of human dignity. The inability of a partner to visit a bedridden loved one, solely because their relationship is not recognized by the state, is a morally reprehensible distinction. It is a cruel irony that those who are most deserving of compassion and support are often the ones denied the basic rights afforded to others.\n\nScience has spoken, and the evidence is clear: homosexual couples, like their heterosexual counterparts, are capable of forming loving and enduring relationships. The factors contributing to relationship satisfaction are not unique to one orientation or the other, but rather a universal human experience. The notion that one type of love is inherently superior to another is a notion as baseless as it is hurtful.\n\nWhen we strip away the rhetoric and the religiosity, the issue at its core is one of equality. If we permit the government to recognize the validity of civil unions, why do we deny the same recognition to marriage? Is it not a double standard to allow one and not the other? The parallels to segregation and the \"separate but equal\" doctrine are striking, and a disturbing reminder of the darker aspects of American history.\n\nThose who argue that gay marriage will somehow corrupt the fabric of society, or that children raised by gay parents will be irreparably damaged, are relying on outdated science and unfounded fears. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against these claims, and yet they persist. It is a chilling reminder of the dangers of unchecked prejudice and the importance of reason in the face of dogma.\n\nIn the end, it is not the job of the government to impose its will on the moral compass of its citizens. Rather, it is the duty of the government to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their orientation. The amendment banning gay marriage is a thinly veiled attempt to impose a particular moral agenda on the nation, one that is as misguided as it is unjust.\n\nAs we navigate the complexities of human nature, it is essential that we listen to the voices of reason and compassion, rather than the whispers of fear and intolerance. The world would be a brighter place if we could see beyond our differences and recognize the common humanity that unites us all.",
            "The hushed tones of a summer afternoon in the hospital pharmacy, where the sterile air clings to the skin like a damp shroud. It is here, amidst the sterile beakers and the quiet whispers of patients in need, that I find myself drawn into the fray of a debate that refuses to be extinguished. The whispered counsel of a cautious mind, it is said that a drug's illicit status does not preclude its potential for healing. This, I firmly believe, is a truth that warrants consideration.\n\nThe shadows cast by the law's stern gaze do not eradicate the benefits of a substance, merely obscure them. Consider, if you will, the controlled substances that lie within our reach: oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets. These, too, were once deemed illicit, yet their utility cannot be denied. Their presence in our arsenal is a testament to the human spirit's capacity for adaptation, a testament to the notion that even the most feared of substances can be harnessed for the greater good.\n\nThe parallels drawn between marijuana and alcohol are facile, but misguided. The former, if abused, can indeed sow discord, but so too can the latter. The distinction lies not in the substance itself, but in the human heart that wields it. To integrate marijuana into our lexicon of remedies, to gradually welcome it into the fold, would be a prudent step, one that acknowledges its potential for healing while also tempering its potential for abuse.\n\nThe pall of prohibition has cast a long shadow over marijuana, one that has sullied its reputation and led many to view it as a pariah. But this is a misconception, a misconception born of fear and ignorance. To dispel this notion, to reveal the gentle face of marijuana, would be to liberate it from the shackles of taboo. And it is here, in this liberation, that we might find a glimmer of hope – a hope that, in time, people may come to understand its value, to wield it responsibly, and to harness its potential for the greater good.",
            "The church, a bastion of tradition, has indeed yielded to the creeping tides of modernity. No longer do its doors stand as a bastion of austerity, but rather a threshold to a realm of flexibility. The once-imposing strictures of Sunday observance have given way to a more relaxed atmosphere, a concession to the capricious whims of a changing world. The children, once attired in their Sunday finery, now mingle with the adults in a haze of casual attire, their beach-worn garb a testament to the dwindling distinction between sacred and profane.\n\nIn the morning masses, where once the devotees donned their Sunday best, now the faithful appear in jeans and khakis, a testament to the prevailing zeitgeist of informality. The church, once a citadel of reverence, has become a more diffuse, less formal institution. And yet, amidst this sea of change, a question lingers: might the church's stance on the ordination of women and the marriage of its clergy have mitigated the scourge of pedophilia that has tainted its reputation?\n\nIt is a notion that strikes at the very heart of the matter. Could the rules and regulations that govern the church's hierarchy have been a catalyst for the very evil it sought to prevent? I say no. The predilections of the human heart are not so easily swayed by dogma or decree. A man's nature, like a deep well, runs true to form. The institution, in its efforts to address this issue, would do well to consider the words of Ecclesiastes: \"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand.\"\n\nPedophilia, a pernicious force, cannot be legislated away by the mere fiat of human edict. It is a darkness that lurks within, a shadow that haunts the recesses of the human heart. A man's inclinations, his desires, are not so easily redirected by the trappings of marriage or the benedictions of the church. They are an intractable part of his being, a stubborn thread in the tapestry of his nature.\n\nAnd so, as we ponder the failings of the church, we must not forget the inherent frailties of human nature. The church's attempts to address this issue, though well-intentioned, are ultimately doomed to fail. For it is not a problem that can be solved by decree or regulation, but rather by the slow and painful process of self-discovery and confession.",
            "A weariness settles over me like a shroud, a fatigue born of a truth slowly revealed. In the aftermath of the September 11th atrocities, a nation reeled, its collective psyche left scarred. And yet, in the darkness of that anguish, a pretext emerged, a justification for the invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration wove a tapestry of deceit, linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden, and the nonexistent cache of weapons of mass destruction a thread that frayed with each passing day.\n\nThe mendacity of the administration's claims still rankles, a festering wound that refuses to heal. The specter of Colin Powell's UN address, a masterful performance of conviction without conviction, now a stark reminder of the administration's propensity for lies. Malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense, a betrayal of the trust placed in those who govern. The Constitution, once a beacon of hope, now lies in tatters, its principles trampled underfoot by a regime oblivious to its own hubris.\n\nThe younger Bush, driven by a bloodlust born of paternal vendetta, had harbored a deep-seated desire for war, a desire that would not be satiated until the sands of Iraq ran red with the blood of its people. Energy interests, a utilitarian calculus, had played a clandestine role in the decision to invade, a quiet coup that would reshape the Middle East to serve the interests of the powerful few.\n\nThe war, a pyre of chaos and destruction, has raged on for far too long. A withdrawal now would only serve to fan the flames of civil war, a maelstrom of violence that would consume the very fabric of Iraqi society. The proposed coalition of nations, a feeble attempt to restore order, only serves to highlight the grave doubts that plague this endeavor. The sovereignty of Iraq, a concept as elusive as the wind, would be reduced to a distant memory, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe Iraqi Parliament, a dysfunctional assembly, struggles to assert its authority, its ineffectiveness a testament to the fractious nature of the country's politics. The figure of the Prime Minister, a shadow of a leader, powerless to stem the tide of chaos. The radical elements, a constant threat to stability, vie for control, their presence a reminder of the anarchy that lies at the heart of this conflict.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, my mind a maelstrom of doubt and confusion. The truth, a will-o'-the-wisp, eludes me, leaving me with only the faintest glimmer of understanding in this desolate landscape of war and deception.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A conflict without form or purpose, a maelstrom of chaos and bloodshed that has consumed us all.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of my thoughts, searching for a thread to cling to, a glimmer of sense in the darkness.  And yet, the more I ponder, the more I am consumed by the void.\n\nIt began, I suppose, as a response to the wounds of nine eleven.  A desire for revenge, a hunger for justice that consumed us all.  But now, as the years stretch out before us like a barren wasteland, I am left to wonder if it was all for naught.  A war without a clear purpose, a conflict without a victor.  We speak of democracy and freedom, but what do we truly mean by these words?  Is it not merely a euphemism for our own self-interest, our own desire to impose our will upon a people who do not desire our help?\n\nI am not one to keep pace with the intricacies of war, the twists and turns of politics and strategy.  But I do know that the longer we linger in this desert, the more we risk succumbing to the very same pitfalls that have consumed the Iraqis themselves.  We speak of building a new nation, but what of the old one?  Is it not being dismantled, piece by piece, as we seek to remake it in our own image?  And for what?  So that we may extract their oil, their resources?  Or so that we may claim another victory, another notch in our belt?\n\nThe ghosts of Vietnam haunt us still, a cautionary tale of the dangers of meddling in the affairs of others.  We speak of the importance of staying the course, but what course is this?  Is it a path of destruction and chaos, or one of peace and understanding?  I am torn, lost in the maelstrom of conflicting emotions and half-truths.\n\nAnd yet, I am drawn back to the faces of those who have fought and died in this conflict.  The families who have lost loved ones, the sons and daughters who have been torn from their homes and their lives.  I am reminded that there are two sides to this conflict, two perspectives that cannot be reduced to simple slogans or soundbites.  And so I am left with more questions than answers, more doubts than certainties.\n\nThe war in Iraq will continue, it seems, a never-ending cycle of violence and bloodshed.  And we will be there, caught in the midst of it all, our actions and decisions shaped by a complex web of motivations and desires.  But what of our own humanity?  Will we emerge from this conflict with our souls intact, or will we be forever changed by the horrors we have unleashed?  Only time will tell, but for now, I am left to ponder the void, searching for a glimmer of sense in the darkness.",
            "The notion of government decreeing the validity of certain creeds is a notion that rankles.  It is an affront to the very fabric of our constitution, a document forged in the fire of reason and freedom.  The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of our republic, is a bulwark against the tyranny of dogma and the whims of the powerful.  \n\nTo attempt to codify the legitimacy of faith into law is to invite the darkness of sectarianism, to cleave the people asunder by the axe of intolerance.  The constitution, a sacred text that has guided our nation from its inception, explicitly safeguards against this very thing.  Its words, etched into the stone of history, bear witness to the wisdom of those who came before us.\n\nThe idea that a single church's edict should be the benchmark for the actions of the state is a notion that reeks of bigotry and oppression.  History is replete with examples of those who have been consumed by the very fire of zealotry they sought to impose upon others.  The Catholic Church, a bastion of tradition and doctrine, is not above reproach in this regard.  Its opposition to this issue is a testament to the variance of faith, and the human propensity for divisiveness.\n\nThe president's push for an amendment, driven by his personal conviction as a Catholic, is a brazen display of preference.  It is a flagrant disregard for the principles of our founding, and a slap in the face to the very idea of religious tolerance that has made our nation great.  There is no economic or social imperative that warrants such a draconian measure.  In fact, the opposite is likely true: a free and open society, unshackled by the constraints of dogma, is far more likely to flourish.\n\nThe notion that the government should dictate the parameters of faith is a notion that should be rejected outright.  It is a slippery slope that leads to the very thing we seek to avoid: the oppression of the many by the few.  We must stand strong against this tide of intolerance, and uphold the principles that have guided us thus far.  The people, not the government, should decide what is right and what is wrong.  The constitution has already spoken, and its words should be our guide.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A conflict that has left an indelible stain upon the fabric of our nation.  It was a war that began with a dubious premise, a rationale that seemed as tenuous as a spider's web in the wind.  The government, in its zeal to justify the invasion, crafted a narrative that linked the attacks of September 11th to the very existence of Saddam Hussein.  But the truth, like a ghost, lingered just beyond the reaches of their words, a specter that haunted the halls of power.\n\nAs one who has always been opposed to the notion of war, I watched with growing unease as our nation embarked upon this ill-fated endeavor.  The preemptive strike, a concept that smacked of hubris and arrogance, seemed to ignore the lessons of history.  The parallels between Iraq and Vietnam were stark, and yet, our government chose to ignore the cautionary tales of the past.\n\nThe human cost of this war has been staggering.  Thousands of American lives lost, thousands more maimed, and a nation left to pick up the pieces of a shattered society.  The removal of a government, the imposition of a new order, and the chaos that followed were all predictable outcomes, yet our leaders seemed to be woefully unprepared for the consequences.\n\nLike a patient who has been lulled into a false sense of security, the American people were promised a swift and decisive victory.  But the reality was far more complex, a labyrinth of insurgency and resistance that has left us mired in a quagmire.  The notion that we could impose our will upon a nation, that we could remake it in our image, was a hubris that has been our undoing.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was the question of motivation.  The rhetoric of democracy and freedom, a noble cause indeed, but one that rings hollow when seen through the prism of self-interest.  The pursuit of oil, the control of resources, a calculus that has guided our actions from the outset.  The absence of weapons of mass destruction, the contradictions in our policy, all these have served to erode the legitimacy of our cause.\n\nAs I reflect upon this conflict, I am left with a sense of unease, a sense that our decisions have been guided more by expediency than principle.  I can only hope that it will soon come to an end, that the people of Iraq will know peace, and that our nation will emerge with a modicum of dignity intact.  But for now, the war in Iraq remains a dark stain upon our collective conscience, a reminder of the perils of unchecked power and the dangers of a leadership that prioritizes expediency over principle.",
            "The notion of gay marriage, a proposition that has long been a point of contention, has always been one that resonates deeply within me. It is a matter, I firmly believe, of personal preference, a choice that is as inherent as the color of one's eyes or the cadence of their heartbeat. The notion that this fundamental aspect of an individual's being can be subject to the whims of societal dictate is, to me, a travesty. The science, I have come to understand, suggests that the inclination towards one's own kind may be rooted in biology, a predisposition that cannot be altered by the vicissitudes of upbringing or environment.\n\nIt is a personal matter, one that transcends the boundaries of politics and state. I see no role for governance in the sanctity of love, be it between two men, two women, or any other configuration. In my own neighborhood, I have witnessed families, forged by love and commitment, that defy the narrow definitions of traditional marriage. They walk their dogs, they tend to their gardens, and they live their lives with the same dignity and purpose as any other family.\n\nAnd yet, we have those who would seek to impose their own will upon others, to pervert the sacred bond of marriage into a tool of their own design. It is a conceit, a hubris, that betrays the very essence of what it means to be human. The president's attempt to parse the meaning of marriage, to impose his own interpretation upon a concept that has been shaped by the trials and tribulations of centuries, is a folly of monumental proportions.\n\nI have delved into the matter, read the reports, the studies, and the findings of those who have sought to understand the human heart. And what I have come to realize is that the inclination towards one's own kind may be as innate as the rhythm of the heart. The influence of environment, of upbringing, may play a role, but it is a minor one. The fundamental truth of our being, the essence of who we are, cannot be reduced to such simplistic explanations.\n\nAnd so, I find myself at odds with a system that would seek to stigmatize, to marginalize, those who would seek to love and commitment in their own way. Marriage, if it is to be a union at all, must be a private affair, a sacred bond between two individuals who have chosen to commit themselves to one another. It is not for the state to dictate, to control, or to judge. It is a matter of the heart, a matter of love, and it must be allowed to flourish, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation.",

When we release a fragment of ourselves into this boundless void, we must be aware that it shall be seen by all. No secrets hide in the digital realm, no whispers are lost to the ether. The very notion of privacy is a myth, a fleeting illusion that dissolves in the harsh light of cyberspace.\n\nAs an RA, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this unyielding medium. The careless words, the hasty thoughts, the desperate pleas – all these and more can be conjured up, only to be forever etched in the annals of cyberspace. And when they are, the consequences are dire. Opinions are formed, judgments are passed, and the weight of the world's gaze settles upon us.\n\nIn the instance that transpired, a rumor, a fragment of a conversation, a whispered threat – whatever its origin, it was enough to set in motion a chain of events that would change the course of our lives. The school officials, bound by their duty to protect, were forced to act. They combed through the digital detritus, searching for answers, for clues that would lead them to the source. And when they found it, they were met with a revelation that would test their resolve.\n\nIn the world of the internet, there is no refuge from prying eyes. We cannot hide from the consequences of our actions, for they are laid bare for all to see. The bulletin, that anonymous whisper, was passed from hand to hand, a catalyst for a chain reaction that would forever alter the landscape.

            "In the desolate twilight of our endeavors, the war has been protracted far beyond its righteous purpose. What began as a noble quest to resurrect democracy in a land beset by tyranny has devolved into a senseless exercise in futility. The initial impetus, though well-intentioned, was soon lost in the mire of circumstance and expediency. The whispered motives of the past, suspect even then, have been shrouded in the shadows of time.\n\nGeorge Bush's father, a man of gravitas and conviction, had long harbored a deep-seated animosity towards Saddam Hussein, a dictator of unyielding cruelty. Whether this familial vendetta was a factor in our decision to invade, it is a question that haunts us still. If our purpose was to bestow democracy upon a people subjugated by the whims of a tyrant, then we might have had justification for our actions. But to suggest that personal grievances played a part in our deliberations would be to compromise the very fabric of our moral authority.\n\nThe conflict, once a bold statement of intent, has dragged on for years, a seemingly endless cycle of bloodshed and despair. We began with a clear objective, to shatter the chains of oppression and liberate a people. Yet, our resolve has wavered, our purpose obscured by the fog of time. The war has become an end in itself, a means of asserting our dominance over the world stage. We are reluctant to surrender, to relinquish the illusion of victory, even as the cost in blood and treasure mounts.\n\nThe economy, once a thriving behemoth, now groans beneath the weight of our protracted involvement. Billions of dollars, siphoned from our own coffers, have been squandered on a conflict that has lost its moral compass. We have ignored the domestic scourges that plague our own lands: poverty, hunger, and disease. Our cities decay, our schools falter, and our healthcare system teeters on the brink of collapse. And for what? So that we might maintain a semblance of power, a fleeting illusion that we have not been defeated in this, our own private Vietnam.\n\nWe have lost sight of our purpose, and in doing so, we have lost ourselves. It is time to acknowledge the futility of our endeavors and withdraw, to allow the Iraqis to fend for themselves, to forge their own destiny. The war has been a drain on our economy, a wound that will not heal. It is time to tend to our own wounds, to direct our resources towards the problems that afflict us, to rediscover our own sense of purpose and direction.",
            "The notion that one might be spared the weight of a life lost, all due to a casual perusal of a profile on a vast and unforgiving expanse of cyberspace, raises a host of questions about the nature of privacy and the unseen hands that shape our lives. It is a notion that implies a world where the web is a watchdog, ever vigilant, ever ready to intervene in the course of human events. But the truth is far more complicated, a labyrinth of rights and responsibilities, of openness and concealment.\n\nIn the realm of Myspace, or any of its ilk, one's personal details are laid bare, a testament to the notion that what is shared with the world is, in fact, a gift to the world. The notion that one might befriend another and, in doing so, grant them unfettered access to one's innermost thoughts and desires, is a curious thing. And yet, it is a choice we all make, a Faustian bargain if you will, where we surrender a measure of our privacy in exchange for the fleeting thrill of connection.\n\nBut what of the stranger, the faceless figure who might stumble upon our profiles, uninvited and unseen? Do we not, in a sense, invite them in, by virtue of our very presence on the web? The notion that someone might be tasked with scouring the digital realm for potential threats is a slippery slope, a path that leads down into the quicksand of discrimination, where the potential for harm is ever-present.\n\nI myself do not have a Myspace, but I do inhabit theFacebook, a realm where the boundaries between public and private are constantly shifting. I am aware of the creeping sense of unease that comes with sharing one's life with the world, the knowledge that there are those out there who might seek to do us harm. The ease with which information can be gathered, the way in which a stranger might insinuate themselves into our lives, is a sobering thing.\n\nAnd yet, the very notion of limiting our online presence is a tricky one. We want to be connected, to share our thoughts and experiences with others, to be seen and heard. And so we strike a balance, a delicate dance between openness and concealment. But in the end, it is a balance that is ever-shifting, a constant negotiation with the unknown.\n\nI was struck by the notion of a high school that sought to ban its students from Myspace, a move that struck me as both arbitrary and oppressive. The notion that a school might dictate what its students can and cannot do online is a curious thing, a blurring of the lines between education and control. But it is a sentiment that speaks to the deeper unease that lies at the heart of our relationship with the web, a fear that we are losing ourselves in the void, that we are becoming anonymous and invisible.",
            "The specter of Iraq looms, a constant reminder of a war that has sullied our collective conscience. I find myself hesitant to broach the subject, a hypocrite among the chorus of dissent that has grown louder with each passing day. The weight of history bears down upon us, and I dare not join the throngs of voices that proclaim their opposition from the outset. Yet, I must confess that my own convictions have evolved, and I now align myself with the majority who deem the invasion a catastrophic mistake.\n\nThe numbers are stark: a resounding seventy-five to eighty percent of the global population, including the Iraqi people themselves, concur that the war was a grave error. Even among the troops stationed in the war-torn country, a significant majority share this view, advocating for an expedited withdrawal. The statistics are a testament to the futility of our endeavor, a quagmire from which we cannot extricate ourselves.\n\nThe culture clash between East and West is a chasm that has long been papered over by the hubris of our leaders. They have sought to impose their notion of democracy upon a people who may not desire it, who may not even comprehend it. Saddam Hussein's tyranny was abhorrent, to be sure, but was it truly our place to determine the fate of a nation, to wield the hammer of intervention with such reckless abandon?\n\nAs I ponder the complexity of this issue, I find myself at a loss for words. The administration touts its vision for a peaceful resolution, a gradual withdrawal, but I remain unconvinced. The prospect of leaving is fraught with peril, yet staying on an indefinite course seems equally calamitous. I have yet to hear a compelling argument for prolonging our occupation, a justification that would assuage my doubts.\n\nIn the end, it is the voices of the Iraqi people that resonate most profoundly. Eighty percent of them believe we should depart within a year; a quarter implore us to leave now. These are the individuals we claim to be rescuing, and their counsel carries a weight that we would do well to heed. By asking for their guidance, we might absolve ourselves of the responsibility that comes with imposing our will upon them. If the venture fails, we can point to their decision as a justification for our withdrawal.\n\nUltimately, our presence in Iraq has been a disaster, a misadventure born of hubris and ignorance. We will never be the benevolent saviors of the Middle East; our actions have already irreparably damaged the fabric of that region. Still, if we were to heed the call of the Iraqi people, if we were to depart with dignity and humility, we might yet salvage some semblance of honor from the ruins of this debacle.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of modern America, a lingering specter of gender discrimination lingers, a stubborn remnant of a bygone era. It is a malaise that infects not solely the realm of women, but also the particular industries and professions that have been calcified by the weight of societal expectation. The glass ceiling persists, a mirage of equality that tantalizes, yet remains elusive, a barrier that bars the advancement of individuals based on their sex rather than their merit.\n\nIn the workplace, women face an insidious form of oppression, their qualifications and abilities overlooked in favor of the conventional wisdom that has been ingrained in the collective psyche. The notion that women are unsuited for leadership positions, that they are not the \"natural\" choice to hold sway over the business world, still lingers, a spectral presence that haunts the corridors of power.\n\nBut this is not a phenomenon unique to women. Men, too, are vulnerable to the same biases and prejudices, their choices and aspirations dismissed as aberrant or unmanly. The stay-at-home father, that most countercultural of roles, is met with suspicion and disdain, his decision to prioritize family and domesticity viewed as a sign of weakness rather than strength. The fashion industry, with its labyrinthine hierarchies and arbitrary standards, is another domain where masculinity is policed and scrutinized, where men who defy the conventional mold are regarded with skepticism and even ridicule.\n\nChange, in this environment, is a slow and halting process. The pace of progress is incremental, measured in increments of acceptance and understanding. Women, increasingly, are breaking through the glass ceiling, assuming positions of power and influence that were once the exclusive preserve of men. The rise of the stay-at-home dad, too, is a phenomenon that is slowly gaining acceptance, as more men begin to question the traditional roles and expectations that have defined masculinity for so long.\n\nBut even as progress is made, there remains a deep-seated reluctance to challenge the status quo, a fear of the unknown that makes it difficult to effect meaningful change. The key, perhaps, lies not in forcing the issue, but in showcasing the qualities and strengths of those who have been marginalized and excluded. By highlighting the achievements and abilities of individuals who defy the conventional wisdom, we may slowly begin to erode the biases and prejudices that have been so deeply ingrained in our society.\n\nAnd yet, even as we make progress, we must acknowledge that there are other forms of discrimination at play, other forms of oppression that are just as insidious and pernicious. Class, geography, and education all play a role in determining who has access to opportunity and who is excluded. The man from the farm, with his rough-hewn speech and unpolished demeanor, may be viewed with suspicion by those who have been schooled in the corridors of power, who view his lack of refinement as a sign of ignorance rather than a badge of honor.\n\nIn this complex and multifaceted landscape, the struggle for equality and justice is an ongoing one, a battle that will not be won easily or quickly. But it is a battle that must be fought, nonetheless, for the sake of our collective humanity, and for the sake of a society that values merit and achievement over arbitrary and outdated notions of what it means to be a man or a woman.",
            "The matter of legalization.  Or rather, decriminalization.  A distinction without a difference for some, yet a chasm of consequence for others.  In this place, the law has shifted, the weight of justice lifted from the shoulders of those who would possess certain substances.  No longer a crime to be shrouded in secrecy, but a transgression to be reckoned with, a mere citation, a minor infraction.\n\nThe question of ramifications lingers, a specter of doubt that haunts those who would seek to indulge.  The specter of job interviews, of futures uncertain, of reputations tarnished.  Yet, there are those who argue that the cost of arrest, of trial, of incarceration, is a weight too great to bear.  The municipalities, strapped for resources, struggling to find solace in a world of dwindling coffers.  In such places, the allure of decriminalization is a siren's call, a promise of freedom from the burdens of a bygone era.\n\nIn places like Denver, where the winds of change blow strong, the people seem more willing to take the leap.  To throw off the shackles of prohibition, to unlock the gates of commerce and freedom.  The promise of revenue, a windfall of sorts, a chance to fund programs long neglected, to nourish the bodies and minds of those in need.\n\nBut there are those who caution against such a course.  Who see the dangers of a substance, of its effects on the body and the mind.  The risk of impairment, of dependency, of a society lost to the haze of indulgence.  And so the debate rages on, a battle of wits, of wills, of conviction.\n\nFor in the end, it is not a question of right or wrong, but of degree.  Of the fine line between moderation and excess.  Of the individuals, each with their own unique response, their own path to tread.  And so we are left with a truth, a truth that is as stark as it is simple: that substances, like people, are complex, multifaceted, and forever shrouded in mystery.",
            "The weight of tradition hangs heavy in the air, a palpable force that binds and constrains. The rituals, the dogma, the unyielding adherence to the ways of old. It is a comfort to cling to what is familiar, to be rooted in the earthy richness of the past. Yet, in this unyielding grasp, lies a danger - the refusal to bend, to yield, to adapt to the shifting currents of time.\n\nThe Catholic Church, a bastion of tradition, stands firm against the tides of change. Its strictures, its catechisms, its unyielding code of conduct. And yet, in this rigidity, lies a hypocrisy. For how can one preach love and acceptance, and yet deny the very essence of those precepts? The story of my parents' marriage, a tale of exclusion and rejection, speaks volumes of this contradiction.\n\nMy mother, a devout Catholic, my father, an Episcopalian - their love, denied by the very institution that claims to teach compassion and understanding. The doctrine of love, a hollow shell, ringing hollow in the ears of those who fail to conform. The practice of the Church, a far cry from the ideals it espouses. Outdated, yet stubbornly clinging to the past, like a shipwreck on the rocks of progress.\n\nThe question of priests and marriage, a mere trifle, a trifling matter, when set against the backdrop of the atrocity that plagues the Church. The confluence of power and pedophilia, a toxic stew, brewed in the depths of institutional rot. And yet, the notion that allowing priests to marry would somehow mitigate this evil, is a naive conceit. The lust for power, the corruption of the human heart, these are not things that can be legislated away, nor can they be cured by the sacrament of marriage.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the absence of marriage that breeds monsters, but the presence of a power that is unaccountable, that is unanswerable to the frailties of humanity. And so, the Church, in its rigidity, in its refusal to bend, stands as a monument to its own failure, a testament to the destructive power of unyielding dogma.",
            "In the twilight of reason, the issue hangs precariously, a delicate balance between the sacrosanct boundaries of church and state. The notion of marriage, a bond forged in the crucible of love and devotion, threatens to splinter asunder beneath the weight of definition. The chasm between right and wrong, once a clear and well-trod path, has grown shrouded in a miasma of uncertainty.\n\nIt is a topic that taxes the mind, a Gordian knot of contradictions, where the sacred and the profane entwine like the tendrils of a vine. To define marriage, to reduce it to a set of prosaic, government-sanctioned terms, is to risk offending those who hold it dear as a sacrament. And yet, to acknowledge its sacrosanct nature is to invite the specter of favoritism, of one denomination or sect being elevated above another.\n\nIn this vacuum of certitude, I find myself adrift, unable to anchor my thoughts to a single, firm conviction. But this much is clear: that the distinction between marriage and civil union is a distinction without a difference. Two people, committed to one another, bound by love and mutual devotion – what is this, if not a union worthy of recognition and respect?\n\nAnd so, I propose that we eschew the label of \"marriage,\" with all its attendant connotations and entanglements, and opt for a more neutral, more inclusive term: civil union. For in the end, it is not the words that matter, but the bond they represent – a bond that transcends the petty squabbles of doctrine and dogma.\n\nAs for the issue of gay marriage, I say this: let us not conflate it with the constitutionally sacrosanct institution of marriage. Let us not reduce it to a matter of amendment, a constitutional coup d'etat that would enshrine prejudice into the very fabric of our laws. The constitution is not a receptacle for the whims of the mob, but a document of enduring principle, a beacon of liberty and justice.\n\nIn the end, it is not the constitution that must be amended, but our own understanding of what it means to be human. Let us not seek to legislate love, but to recognize it, in all its forms, as a fundamental aspect of our shared humanity.",
            "The shadows of my upbringing as a Christian linger, a specter of doubt that haunts me still. For in the grey expanse between faith and reason, I find myself questioning the tenets of my upbringing. I have walked among those who have known love in its most forbidden forms, and I have seen the depth of their humanity. And yet, I still find myself at odds with the choices they have made.\n\nBut it is not my place to judge. The law, that great and unwieldy beast, should not be imposed upon the land by the hand of a single man. No, the decision to recognize the bonds of love between same-sex couples should be left to the discretion of each individual state, to be determined by the people who will live with its consequences.\n\nI have watched as the pendulum of power has swung, and the tides of public opinion have ebbed and flowed. But in the end, it is not the president who will bear the weight of this decision. It is the people, the common folk who toil in the fields and tend the hearths, who will be forced to live with the fruits of this legislation.\n\nAnd so I believe that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the states, to be determined by the will of the people. For it is they who will be most affected by this decision, and it is they who should have a say in how it is governed. The president, that great and distant figure, should not presume to speak for the people, to impose his will upon them as if he were some sort of monarch. No, the people should be free to make their own decisions, to govern themselves as they see fit.\n\nIn the end, it is not about the law, but about the human heart. And it is in the hearts of the people that this decision should be made, not in the halls of power.",
            "The notion that Myspace is a private domain is a notion best left to the uninitiated.  In reality, it is a public stage upon which one's every thought and action is laid bare for all to see.  The notion that a student posting on Myspace might be unaware of this is a notion that defies common sense.  When one posts on the internet, one forfeits the right to privacy, for the internet is a realm where the past and present coexist in an eternal dance of transparency.\n\nThe school officials, in their efforts to protect their students, are merely exercising a duty that is incumbent upon them.  They have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of those in their care, and if that means monitoring the online activities of their students, then so be it.  The notion that this is an invasion of privacy is a notion that is both misguided and shortsighted.  For in a world where the horrors of Columbine and other such atrocities lurk in the shadows, one's personal safety cannot be taken for granted.\n\nThe school officials, in their efforts to prevent such tragedies, were merely doing what was necessary to protect their students.  They were not engaging in some grand conspiracy, but rather fulfilling their duty to provide a safe and secure environment for learning.  And if that means monitoring the online activities of their students, then so be it.\n\nIt is a quaint notion that one's online activities are somehow separate from their real lives.  But the truth is, they are not separate.  The internet is a mirror that reflects our every move, and those who would seek to hide their true nature do so at their own peril.  The school officials, in their efforts to ensure the safety of their students, were merely acknowledging this reality.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of perspective.  Is the school official's decision to monitor the online activities of their students an invasion of privacy, or is it a necessary measure to ensure their safety?  The answer, much like the internet itself, is a reflection of our own moral compass.",
            "It began with the echo of fire, the scent of ash and smoke, a wound that would not heal. The flames of September's horror still danced in the hearts of the people, and I stood among them, a vessel of fury and vengeance. At first, I was consumed by the desire to unleash our wrath upon those who had perpetrated such evil. I envisioned a maelstrom of destruction, a reckoning that would rival the devastation they had wrought upon our own soil.\n\nBut as the embers of that passion cooled, I began to see the world in a different light. The tumultuous landscape of the Middle East, a tapestry of ancient hatreds and tribal vendettas, seemed to mock our simplistic notions of good and evil. We had descended upon their shores, a force both pitiless and unprepared, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own sorrow.\n\nIn the aftermath, I came to realize that our involvement was a tragic miscalculation, a flight from the darkness of our own past rather than a bold step into the light. We had avenged our losses, but in doing so, we had sown the seeds of further chaos. The people of that land, a complex web of contradictions, were not so easily swayed by our benevolence or our military might. They were a people of a different creed, one that prized honor and loyalty above all else.\n\nAs I looked upon the ruins of our endeavor, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disillusionment. We had entered their world with a messianic fervor, convinced that we could remake their society in our own image. But they were not a people to be saved or redeemed; they were a people to be understood, with all their flaws and imperfections.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy we sought to vanquish, but our own hubris. We had come to believe that we were the saviors of the world, that our presence was a blessing, and that our withdrawal a curse. But the truth was far more mundane: we were a people lost in a labyrinth of our own making, driven by passions that we could not control.\n\nAs I stood on the precipice of this realization, I knew that our involvement was a mistake, a grave error that would haunt us for generations to come. We had tried to impose our will upon a people who would not be swayed, and in doing so, we had merely hastened their downfall. It was a lesson that would be etched in my mind forever: that in the end, it is not the enemy we must fear, but our own fallibility."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the depths of a changing world, the Catholic Church stands as a relic of a bygone era.  A once mighty institution, now hemorrhaging followers as it clings to antiquated tenets.  The fault lies not in the faithful, but in the Church's rigid stance on issues of the modern age.  The specter of gay marriage, the contentious issue of abortion, and the contentious matter of birth control loom large, casting a pall of intolerance over a Church that once claimed to be the embodiment of compassion.\n\nTheir views, though well-intentioned, are naively out of touch with the world around them.  As the Church remains steadfast in its opposition to these modern conundrums, it risks losing the very people it seeks to guide.  The Church's unyielding stance on these matters appears to be a relics of a bygone era, a time when the world was a simpler, more black-and-white place.  In this brave new world, the Church must adapt or risk irrelevance.\n\nThe erosion of faith is a gradual process, one that begins with a growing sense of disillusionment.  As individuals come to realize that their own values are at odds with those of the Church, they drift away, drawn to a more inclusive, more compassionate worldview.  The Church's rigid stance on these issues serves only to drive them further away, a cold wind that howls through the empty pews.\n\nConsider the matter of abortion.  A woman's right to choose is a fundamental tenet of modern society, one that the Church vehemently opposes.  For those who hold this view dear, the idea of belonging to a community that denounces it as a sin is a bitter pill to swallow.  Similarly, the Church's stance on gay marriage serves as a barrier to entry for those who would otherwise find solace in its teachings.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of female priests and married clergy.  A seeming anachronism in an age where women hold positions of power and authority, the Church's refusal to ordain women or permit its clergy to marry is a relic of a bygone era.  Does it follow that this would have altered the course of history?  Perhaps not.  Yet it is a question worth pondering, a reminder that even the most seemingly immutable institutions are subject to the whims of time.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of balance.  The priest, like any man, is a multifaceted individual, capable of love, compassion, and devotion.  Why must he be bound to a single, monastic existence?  The world outside the Church is full of men and women who have found a way to balance their work and their personal lives.  Why should the priest be any different?  It is a question that speaks to the very heart of the Church's dilemma: can it adapt, or will it succumb to the forces of progress?  Only time will tell.",
            "The shadows of doubt crept in, like a chill on a winter's night, as I grappled with the weight of a question that had been thrust upon me. The notion of gay marriage, a concept that had been debated by many, left me with a sense of unease, like a land torn asunder by the ravages of time. I did not find myself opposed to the union of two individuals, regardless of their persuasion, for in the end, it is not the choices we make that define us, but the essence that lies within.\n\nThe idea that one is born with a predisposition, a leaning towards the unknown, seemed to me a truth both simple and profound. Whether it is the whispered secrets of the womb or the whispered prayers of the heavens, the mystery of our existence remains a tangled web of fate and chance. To hold another accountable for that which they cannot control, to judge them for that which they cannot change, seemed to me a cruel and heartless act.\n\nI thought of the words of a wise man, who once said that to deny another their right to love, to love as they see fit, is to deny the very essence of humanity. And I could not help but agree, for in the grand tapestry of life, it is not the politics of man that define us, but the love we share with one another. The federal government, with its laws and regulations, its moral codes and decrees, seemed to me an outsider, a stranger in a strange land, meddling in matters that were not its to meddle in.\n\nThe thought of it was a heavy burden to bear, a weight that pressed upon my chest like the stones of a grave. But I knew that I could not remain silent, for in the silence lies the consent of the oppressor. So I spoke out, a lone voice in the wilderness, a cry of protest against the injustice that had been done.\n\nIn the end, it was not a matter of choice, but of right and wrong. It was not a matter of politics, but of the human heart. And I knew that I could not stand idly by, for to do so would be to betray the very essence of our shared humanity.",
            "In the twilight of modernity, where shadows of doubt creep across the landscape, a question lingers: should the union of two individuals of the same sex be recognized by the law? The answer, like the wind that rustles through the trees, seems simple, yet it holds the weight of centuries. For what reason, indeed, can be cited to deny the love and commitment of two individuals who seek the sacred bond of marriage?\n\nMany claim that the union of same-sex couples threatens the institution of the family, that it is an aberration, a deviation from the natural order. But this reasoning falters on the rocks of reason. For what is the family, but a union of love and commitment, a bond that transcends the boundaries of flesh and blood? The love and devotion of two individuals, regardless of their sex, is a flame that burns with the same fierce and unwavering passion.\n\nAnd what of the rights that accompany marriage? The right to share property, to make medical decisions, to visit one another in times of sickness? These are not the exclusive domain of heterosexuality, but the universal rights of humanity. To deny these rights to same-sex couples is to render them less than human, to treat them as second-class citizens.\n\nThe studies are clear: same-sex couples fare no differently in their relationships than their straight counterparts. They experience the same joys and sorrows, the same triumphs and failures. They love and cherish one another with the same ferocity, the same devotion. And yet, they are denied the simple recognition of their love, the dignity of marriage.\n\nThe Church and State have long been entwined, but this union is not a sacrament. Marriage is a civil contract, a document issued by the government, not a sacred ritual. To deny same-sex couples this document is to deny them their basic human rights. It is a form of segregation, a separate but unequal system that perpetuates the notion that some are more equal than others.\n\nThe arguments against gay marriage are built on shifting sands. Some claim that children of same-sex parents will be damaged by their upbringing, that they will be influenced by their parents' orientation. But the evidence is to the contrary. Children of gay parents are just as well-adjusted, just as happy, as children of straight parents. They are shaped by their environment, their culture, their family, not by the sex of their parents.\n\nThe federal government should take a stand on this issue, should recognize the love and commitment of same-sex couples and grant them the same rights and dignity as their straight counterparts. The amendment that seeks to ban gay marriage is a relic of a bygone era, a relic of intolerance and bigotry.\n\nAnd so, I say to those who would deny same-sex couples the right to marry: listen to the evidence, listen to the experts, listen to the hearts of those who would be denied their basic human rights. For in the end, it is not about morality or religion, but about justice, about equality, about the simple recognition of the love and commitment of two individuals who seek to build a life together.",
            "The sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy where I toil away during the sweltering summer months. It is a place where the boundaries of legality are often blurred, where the distinctions between right and wrong are tested by the cold, unforgiving light of necessity. A drug, no matter its illicit status, holds within it the power to either heal or harm. The fact that some substances are outlawed does not preclude their utility; indeed, many a controlled substance finds its way into the pharmacy, its potency harnessed for the greater good.\n\nConsider oxycodone, vicodin, and perocet - these are the pharmaceuticals that walk the fine line between solace and addiction. We employ them with caution, mindful of the thin thread that separates benefit from ruin. And yet, we dare not apply the same reasoning to cannabis, that most maligned of substances. The taboo that surrounds it is a heavy shroud, one that obscures the truth of its potential benefits.\n\nAlcohol, too, is a substance that can be abused, its deleterious effects well-documented. But is it not also a substance that, in moderation, can bring solace and comfort to those who partake of it? I would argue that the same can be said of cannabis. The key lies not in its legalization, but in the removal of the damaging stigma that clings to it like a specter. When the public's perception of marijuana is no longer clouded by fear and misinformation, perhaps then we may see a shift towards responsible use.\n\nThe image of cannabis as a scourge on society is a false one, a product of our collective imagination. It is not heroine, nor cocaine, nor any of the other demons that haunt our collective psyche. It is time to peel away the layers of misconception and reveal the truth: that marijuana, like any substance, holds within it the potential for both harm and healing. Only when we acknowledge this duality can we hope to harness its benefits, and use it as a tool for the betterment of humanity.",
            "The church, a stalwart sentinel of tradition, has ceded to the whims of the modern era. Its once-stern visage has given way to a more relaxed countenance, a concession to the capricious nature of the 21st century. Sundays, once a day of solemn ritual, now unfold with a sense of informality, a far cry from the staid attire of yesteryear. The young girls, once decked in pristine dresses and matching shoes, now attend in casual splendor, their parents' relaxed attire a reflection of the times.\n\nI remember the private school's weekly gatherings, where friends would converge in a whirlwind of chatter and communal worship. The services, once a staid and lengthy affair, have been condensed to a mere thirty minutes, a pacing that belies the depth of the ritual. The summer months bring a special kind of chaos, as families, fresh from the beach, stumble into the sanctuary, their attire a testament to the irreverent spirit of the age.\n\nYet, despite these changes, the essence of the church remains, a constant in a world of flux. I dare not speculate on the intricacies of the church's politics, content to observe the external manifestations of its evolution. And so, I am left to ponder the larger questions that plague the institution: the allegations of pedophilia, the weight of which threatens to upend the very foundations of the church.\n\nIn my considered opinion, I do not believe that the church's stance on marriage or the ordination of women would have averted the scourge of pedophilia. The inclinations of the afflicted are not so easily swayed by the sacraments of marriage or the presence of women in the clergy. These aberrant desires are, in my estimation, rooted in the very fabric of the individual, a product of their genetic predisposition. The façade of marriage or the absence of women in the clergy may yet conceal the true nature of the offender, a truth that will eventually be revealed in time.\n\nIf the church knew of these transgressions and chose to cover them up, then shame indeed befalls them. Yet, I do not believe that this is the case in all instances. The church, like any institution, is composed of fallible mortals, prone to the frailties of humanity. It is in the darkness of these failings that we must search for the truth, and not in the fleeting solutions offered by the changing of rules or the adoption of new practices.",
            "The September 11th attacks had left the nation reeling, a maelstrom of fear and uncertainty that hung in the air like a miasma. And in the midst of this chaos, the Bush administration's precipitous descent into Iraq seemed a pretext, a fragile thread of justification that threatened to unravel with each passing day. The assertion that Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction, that his regime was inextricably linked to the events of 9/11, now appears as a hollow sham, a fabrication that has left a stain upon the nation's conscience.\n\nThe memory of Colin Powell's presentation to the UN, a spectacle of conviction and conviction, now seems a distant echo, a hollow mockery of the truth. That even he, a man of integrity and principle, would later confess to doubts about the evidence, is a testament to the depths of malfeasance that had taken hold of the administration. To lie to the American people, to deceive them in such a brazen manner, is an offense of the gravest sort, an affront to the very fabric of our democracy.\n\nThe constitution, that sacred document that has guided us since our nation's inception, has been disregarded, its principles cast aside like so much trash. The Bush administration's actions, a calculated move towards war, a war that was seemingly ordained from the outset, has left a trail of destruction in its wake. The younger Bush, driven by a vendetta, a desire for vengeance, against the Hussein regime, has overseen a catastrophe of epic proportions.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has reached a critical juncture, a precipice from which there seems no return. The withdrawal of American forces would likely plunge the country into chaos, a maelstrom of violence that would claim countless lives. Yet, the alternative, a coalition of regional nations, seems equally unpalatable, a recipe for disaster. The interim government teeters on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty compromised by the very presence of foreign powers.\n\nThe news from Iraq is a litany of woes, a tale of a government in disarray, of politicians at odds, and of radical elements vying for power. The Parliament, a body tasked with guiding the nation towards stability, is a shadow of its former self, a mere shell of a institution. And as the country teeters on the edge of chaos, there seems no respite, no clear path forward, only the specter of continued strife and bloodshed.",
            "The shadows of doubt crept over me like a shroud, as I struggled to articulate my thoughts on the war in Iraq. A conflict that had long since lost its clarity, its purpose, and its meaning. It was a war that had never been declared, a war that had been reduced to a mere whisper, a war that had devoured the very fabric of our nation's conscience. \n\nLike a mirage on the desert sands, the war's justification seemed to shift and writhe, evading my grasp. Was it a quest for democracy, a crusade to bring freedom to the oppressed? Or was it a naked display of power, a flexing of muscles to assert our dominance over the Middle East? I couldn't say, for certain. The lines had grown blurred, the truth obscured by the din of propaganda and the stench of blood and smoke.\n\nAs I spoke, my words faltered, like a man stumbling through a barren landscape. I felt the weight of my ignorance bearing down upon me, the knowledge that I knew so little of the conflict, of its causes, its consequences, its very essence. And yet, I felt the weight of my opinions, the conviction that this war was a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task that would consume us all.\n\nBut then, a glimmer of doubt crept in, like a cold wind on a winter's night. What of the families, the sons and daughters who fought and died in this senseless conflict? What of the lives we had destroyed, the hope we had extinguished? I thought of the children, forced to grow up in a world of violence and fear, their futures reduced to a mere specter. And I felt the weight of my words, the weight of my indecision.\n\nThe war in Iraq had become a Gordian knot, a tangled web of conflicting desires and flawed justifications. I couldn't untangle it, couldn't make sense of it. All I could do was stand there, frozen in uncertainty, as the war raged on, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and despair.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, I felt the pressure to speak, to say something, anything, to fill the void. But my words were hollow, empty, and futile. The war in Iraq had become a void, a chasm that swallowed all meaning, all purpose. And I was left with nothing but the echoes of my own indecision.",
            "The notion of the state's involvement in the affairs of the church is a notion that reeks of trespass. It is a thing that reeks of overreach, of a power that knows no bounds. The constitution, that venerable document, speaks of a separation of church and state, a delicate balance that must be maintained lest we invite the darkness of dogma into the halls of government. And yet, it seems that there are those who would seek to upset this balance, to impose their will upon us all.\n\nThe argument, such as it is, centers around the idea that the churches themselves should be the ones to dictate what is right and wrong. But this is a flawed notion, for it is the state that must ensure that the rights of all are protected, not just those of the dominant few. And what of those who do not subscribe to the dominant creed? Are they to be cast aside, their rights ignored in favor of the whims of the powerful?\n\nThe push for an amendment, a move that would effectively codify the state's role in the church, is a move that reeks of hypocrisy. It is a move that seeks to impose the will of one group upon the many, to dictate what is acceptable and what is not. And for what reason? So that the president, or some other self-appointed arbiter, may impose their personal views upon the nation? It is a thing that I do not understand.\n\nThe impact of such a move would be far-reaching, and not in a good way. It would be a blow to the very fabric of our society, a society built on the principles of tolerance and understanding. It would be a move that would further divide us, that would create a chasm between those who are deemed acceptable and those who are not. And for what? So that a few may impose their will upon the many?\n\nI do not believe that the federal government, or any government for that matter, should be involved in this issue. It is not their place to dictate what is right and wrong, to impose their will upon the churches. The churches, with their ancient traditions and their sacred texts, must be left to their own devices. It is they who must decide what is acceptable, not some self-appointed authority.\n\nAnd as for the amendment itself, I see no reason for it. It is a move that would be a restriction, not of the government, but of the people. It would be a move that would stifle the very freedom that we hold dear, that would limit the choices of those who do not share the views of the dominant few. It is a move that I do not support, and one that I fear would have far-reaching and devastating consequences.",
            "The shadows of war cast a long and foreboding presence over the desolate landscape of Iraq. A war born of deceit and fueled by the flames of a nation's outrage, its justification a tangled web of half-truths and calculated manipulation. The government's words, like autumn leaves, rustled in the wind, promising a swift and triumphant victory, but in reality, they hid the darkness that was to come.\n\nI recall the echoes of a nation's anger, still resonating from the wounds of September 11th, a day that shattered the complacency of a people and set in motion the machinery of war. The drums of war beat loud and clear, as the government wove a tale of connection, a narrative that tied the invasion of Iraq to the heinous acts of terrorism. But the threads of truth were thin and frayed, and the fabric of reality was soon to be torn asunder.\n\nAs one opposed to the senseless slaughter of war, I watched with dread as the US government plunged headlong into the abyss, heedless of the lessons of the past, particularly the Vietnam War, where hubris and arrogance had led to a quagmire of blood and tears. The US government, in its haste to impose its will, failed to consider the complexities of human nature, the fierce resistance that would rise against the occupation, and the void left in the wake of a toppled regime.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's government was a pyre that burned brightly, but its embers cast a long shadow, illuminating the chaos and anarchy that followed. The US government, woefully unprepared for the aftermath, stumbled forward, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction and death. The nation's soldiers, like so many sacrificial lambs, fell to the ground, their blood a testament to the senselessness of war.\n\nThe attempt to impose democracy on a nation, akin to the Vietnam experience, was a folly of monumental proportions. The US government had forgotten the struggles of its own past, the blood-soaked battles fought to establish its own democracy. The path to freedom is never an easy one, but the US government seemed to believe that its own brand of democracy was the panacea for all ills.\n\nAs the war dragged on, and American casualties mounted, the question of why Iraq had become the chosen battleground lingered, an elephant in the room, a truth that was too painful to confront. The oil, the resources, the strategic interests – these were the unspoken reasons that drove the US government's actions. North Korea, a nation known to possess WMDs, was left untouched, a stark reminder of the duplicity that lay at the heart of US foreign policy.\n\nThe war in Iraq has become a quagmire of uncertainty, a testament to the futility of war. The ghosts of the past haunt the present, a reminder that the US government's actions were not driven by altruism, but by a desire for power and control. As the war drags on, the question of when it will end, and at what cost, remains a haunting specter, a reminder that the wounds of war will take generations to heal.",
            "The question hangs in the air like a specter, its presence as inevitable as the sun's descent into the desert horizon. I have always stood resolute, unyielding in my conviction: the union of two individuals, regardless of their station or inclination, should be a matter of personal choice, unencumbered by the heavy hand of societal dictate.\n\nIt is a notion that has been borne out by the whispers of science: the delicate tapestry of our biology, a complex dance of hormones and genes that we cannot fully comprehend, yet which may well determine the course of our destinies. And it is here that I believe the crux of the matter lies - in the inescapable fact that our inclinations, those secret and furtive stirrings that shape us, are not our own to command or reject.\n\nThe notion that we should be denied the simple freedom to love, to form a union that brings us joy and comfort, because of some arbitrary construct of societal expectation, is a cruelty of the highest order. It is a cruel joke, played by those who would seek to impose their will upon us, to dictate the terms of our existence.\n\nI have walked among those who have been denied this basic right, those couples who, despite their devotion to one another, are forced to keep their love hidden, their relationships shrouded in secrecy. I have seen the way they live, their lives a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience and adaptation. They do not differ from us, save in the eyes of those who would seek to judge them. They walk their dogs, they live their lives, they love with the same fervor and devotion as any other family.\n\nAnd yet, those who would seek to impose their will upon us, to interpret the sacred institution of marriage through the prism of their own twisted desires, are the ones who are truly ridiculous. They would have us believe that their interpretation is the one true vision, that their God-given right to dictate the terms of our existence is a divine mandate.\n\nBut I know the truth. I know that marriage is a simple, private thing, a union between two people who love one another, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation. It is a thing that should be celebrated, not condemned. It is a thing that should be left to the individuals, to the households, to the communities that they call home. Not to the politicians, not to the governments, not to the self-appointed guardians of morality.\n\nI have read, I have heard, I have seen the evidence. The science is clear: our inclinations are not a choice, but a fact, a biological imperative that cannot be denied. And it is here that I stand, resolute in my conviction that the freedom to love, to form a union, should be a basic human right, unencumbered by the vicissitudes of societal opinion.",
            "The void of the internet spreads far, a vast and unforgiving expanse where words take on lives of their own.  When we cast our thoughts into this chasm, we must not be surprised if they are received in ways we could never have intended.  As an RA, I've seen it myself - the reckless abandon of words, the gravity of their consequences.  A careless quip, a thoughtless post, and the world is altered, its currents shifting to carry us along.  We cannot hide behind the veil of anonymity, for the internet is a public forum, a place where the boundaries of our private lives are constantly blurred.\n\nI recall a particular incident at our school, one that served as a stark reminder of the perils of this virtual world.  A student's words, meant as a joke, were overheard and reported to the authorities.  In the aftermath, it became clear that the student's online presence had been the catalyst for the entire ordeal.  The dangers of this space are real, and we must be mindful of the impact our words can have.  Once we release something into the ether, we cannot reclaim it, cannot control how it is received.\n\nThe notion of privacy is a fleeting concept in this digital age.  If we do not wish to be seen, we must be cautious about what we reveal.  But even then, the lines are blurred, and the boundaries are constantly shifting.  School officials, in their efforts to protect their students, must navigate this treacherous landscape.  They are not voyeurs, but custodians, tasked with ensuring the safety of those in their care.\n\nI do not advocate for the monitoring of private conversations, but I do believe that if concerns are brought to their attention, they must be taken seriously.  The responsibility lies with us, to be mindful of our online presence, to consider the consequences of our words.  As RAs, we are not expected to be omniscient, but we must be aware of the potential risks, and take steps to mitigate them.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, one that requires us to be vigilant, to be mindful of the words we choose to share, and the world we create.  We must not be swayed by the siren song of anonymity, but instead, we must take responsibility for our actions, for the words we release into the void.  Only then can we hope to navigate this vast and unforgiving expanse, unscathed.",
            "The war has dragged on interminably, its purpose muddled beyond recognition. What began as a noble crusade to plant the seeds of democracy in foreign soil has withered and died, its original intent lost in a morass of bureaucratic tedium and imperial hubris. The dream of liberating a people from tyranny was a just one, but it was sullied from the outset by the personal vendettas of those who sought to impose their will upon the world. The ghosts of George Bush's father linger, their ghosts whispering in the ears of those who would wield power.\n\nWe did manage to make our presence known in the early days, our statement a stark and brutal one. But the years have dragged on, a seemingly endless expanse of blood and gold. The war has become a thing in and of itself, a self-perpetuating beast that devours our economy and our souls. We speak of victory, of a decisive end to the conflict, but what does that mean in a landscape scorched and barren? What does it mean when the very purpose of the war has been lost to the sands of time?\n\nThe cost is staggering, a drain on our resources that could be better spent on the very problems that plague our own shores. Poverty, neglect, and decay – these are the enemies we should be fighting, not some far-off tyranny. We speak of democracy, of freedom, but we are blind to the tyranny of our own making. We are bleeding ourselves dry, our people dying in a foreign land for a cause that has long since been lost.\n\nThe time has come to extricate ourselves from this quagmire, to recognize that the people we sought to liberate must now fend for themselves. The war has been a drain on our economy, a stain on our conscience. It is time to end it, to redirect our efforts towards the problems that truly matter. We must tend to our own gardens, to nurture the seeds of freedom and justice that bloom within our own borders. For in the end, it is not the wars we fight abroad that will define us, but the wars we fight at home.",
            "The notion that someone's actions were foiled because of something they found online weighs heavy on my mind.  It seems it all began with a simple search, a perusal of the internet, where the boundaries of our private lives are laid bare.  For on sites like Myspace, where one's most intimate thoughts are shared with the world, it is a given that all who wander upon it will bear witness to our deepest secrets.  And indeed, it is a condition of entry, a tacit understanding that comes with accepting another as a \"friend\" - that they may see all that we hold dear.  It is a surrender, a yielding of our private selves to the void, where the gaze of strangers lingers and lingers.\n\nAnd yet, in the face of such vulnerability, we find solace in the notion that some benevolent soul may stumble upon our online presence and prevent a calamity from unfolding.  But how do we reconcile this with the specter of surveillance, the notion that one person, tasked with monitoring the online lives of all, may become judge, jury, and executioner?  The burden of such a responsibility weighs heavy indeed, a weight that threatens to crush the very spirit of freedom.\n\nI am a user of Facebook, and while I take some comfort in the fact that I have chosen who among my acquaintances may view my profile, I am still wary of the unseen eyes that lurk in the shadows.  A television program once aired a segment about a man who demonstrated the ease with which one may uncover the most intimate details of another's life.  He discovered a young woman's screen name and, in a matter of minutes, coaxed her into meeting with him.  The ease with which he accomplished this sent a shiver down my spine, a stark reminder of the fragility of our online existence.\n\nAs I navigate the delicate balance between openness and secrecy, I am reminded of the words of my roommate, who spoke of a time when her high school banned students from using Myspace.  The notion struck me as a heavy-handed attempt to exert control over the lives of young people, a curtailment of their freedom that seemed both oppressive and misguided.  Did the authorities truly have the right to dictate what these young people could and could not do?  I am but a humble student, unsure of the answers to such questions, but I do know that in this vast, interconnected web we weave, the lines between private and public are increasingly blurred.",
            "The weight of the Iraq War settles upon us like a shroud, a constant reminder of the hubris that guides our actions. To speak of it now, to offer an opinion, is to invite the charge of hypocrisy. And I confess, I am hesitant, wary of joining the chorus of critics who declare their opposition with such certitude. But I was against it, yes, I was. The war was a calamity from its inception, a maelstrom of violence and bloodshed that consumed us all.\n\nThe polls are legion, a chorus of voices that cry out against the folly of our endeavors. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, a staggering number, declares the war a mistake. The Iraqis themselves, those we sought to save, are resolute in their desire for our departure. Eighty percent of the population clamors for our exit, a quarter more, driven by desperation, demands we leave now. And what of the troops, the brave men and women who toil in the desert, their sweat and blood shed in a cause they no longer believe in? They too, a majority, yearn for the day when we will depart, when the madness will cease.\n\nThe culture clash, a chasm so deep it seems insurmountable, separates us from the people of the Middle East. We brought democracy to a land where it was uninvited, where the very notion is anathema. The administration, blind to the futility of our endeavor, persists in its delusions. Saddam, a monster, yes, but was he not a monster of our making, a creature born of our own creation? The pros and cons, weighed and measured, revealed a war that would be a disaster, a quicksand that would consume us all.\n\nI see no reason to stay, no justification for our continued presence. The administration's hopes, their optimistic assessments of a brighter future, ring hollow. The problems that may arise from our departure, they pale in comparison to the catastrophe we have wrought. We have asked the Iraqis, those we claim to aid, what they desire, and they have told us to leave. Their voices, a cacophony of desperation, should be heeded. If we depart, we will be free from the guilt of our actions, our hands clean of the blood we have spilled.\n\nAnd so, I say, let us leave. Let us depart, and let the people of Iraq forge their own destiny, free from our interference. It matters not if we are seen as the \"good guys\" or not. We will never be. But we can be the lesser of two evils, a presence that is no longer a burden.",
            "The specter of gender discrimination haunts the United States like a persistent shadow, a relic of a bygone era that refuses to be vanquished. It seeps into every crevice of our society, manifesting in the most insidious ways. For women, the glass ceiling remains an unyielding barrier, a constant reminder that, despite the rhetoric of equality, true parity remains a distant dream. The workplace is a crucible where this inequality is forged, where the very notion of a woman in a position of power is still met with skepticism and doubt.\n\nHistorically, women have been relegated to the periphery of the business world, their careers stunted by the weight of societal expectations. The boardrooms, once the exclusive domain of men, continue to be the preserve of a select few, their ranks still largely bereft of women. And yet, even when women do break through, they are often met with resistance, their abilities questioned by those who cannot fathom a world where a woman is the leader. It is a cruel irony that the very same society that touts equality as a fundamental right can be so quick to undermine it.\n\nBut this is not a problem unique to women. Men, too, are bound by the strictures of societal expectations. The stay-at-home father, once a rare and pitied creature, is now beginning to find acceptance, albeit grudgingly. The old adage that a man's place is in the breadwinner's role still holds sway, and those who defy this convention are met with suspicion and scorn. And in the rarefied world of fashion, the male who dares to dabble in creativity and style is often dismissed as an aberration, his sensibilities suspect because they do not conform to traditional norms.\n\nThe solution, it seems, lies in a delicate balance between promoting the qualities of those who are marginalized and not overwhelming them with forced change. It is a slow and painful process, one that requires patience and understanding. We have made progress, to be sure, but the road ahead is long and treacherous. The greatest challenge lies not in pushing forward, but in convincing a society that is wedded to its traditions to accept the new and the different.\n\nAnd yet, even as we make progress, we are reminded that discrimination knows no bounds. The rural dweller, with his rough-hewn manner and unpolished speech, is often looked down upon by those who have never known hardship. His intelligence and worth are discounted because of his place of origin, his very accent a badge of shame. It is a cruel reminder that, in the end, it is not just gender that is the source of our biases, but a complex tapestry of factors that we would do well to acknowledge and confront.",
            "The notion of legalization, or rather decriminalization, is a point of contention. They did not eradicate it, merely relegated it from a transgression worthy of the full weight of the law to a minor infraction, akin to a traffic citation. A slap on the wrist, a summons to appear, a fleeting inconvenience, rather than the crushing restraint of incarceration. \n\nThe long-term repercussions, however, linger, a specter haunting the lives of those who have been touched by it. The specter of disapproval, of revulsion, of a cloud that follows one's every step, a constant reminder of past transgressions. It is a burden that does not evaporate with the stroke of a pen, nor with the passage of time.\n\nYet, there are those who argue that the cost of pursuing such transgressions is prohibitive. The expense of arrest, of trial, of incarceration, of the endless cycles of the justice system, a drain on resources that could be better allocated elsewhere. In municipalities strained by financial hardship, the prospect of embracing decriminalization is a hard pill to swallow, a concession too great to make.\n\nBut in places where the winds of change are blowing, where the air is thick with the scent of progress, the calculus shifts. Denver, a city of open minds and open hearts, has taken the leap, and in doing so, has freed up resources to be allocated to more pressing concerns: the education of its youth, the care of its elderly, the sustenance of its most vulnerable citizens.\n\nIt is a delicate balance, a tightrope to walk, for marijuana is not a substance to be taken lightly. Its presence can be a blight, a scourge on the streets, a poison that seeps into the very fabric of society. Yet, in moderation, it can be a panacea, a balm for the weary soul.\n\nBut moderation is a virtue that not all possess, and the effects of its abuse can be far-reaching. The motor skills impaired, the decision-making clouded, the lifestyle altered in ways both subtle and profound. And yet, like all substances, it is a double-edged sword, a tool that can be wielded for good or ill, depending on the hand that wields it.\n\nIt is a mystery, this interaction between substance and user, a puzzle that may never be fully solved. Each person reacts differently, a unique harmony of biology and environment, a symphony of chemicals and circumstances. Some are able to navigate the treacherous waters with ease, while others are shipwrecked on the rocky shores of addiction.\n\nAnd so, we are left with a complex web of considerations, a tapestry woven from the threads of reason and restraint, of freedom and responsibility. The path forward is not always clear, but one thing is certain: the consequences of our choices will be with us for a long time to come.",
            "The devout and the dogmatic, entrenched in the traditions of a bygone era, cling to the familiar rhythms of the past.  Theirs is a path well-worn and well-trodden, a litany of rituals and observances that have been practiced for generations.  And yet, it is this very steadfastness that can also be a hindrance, a refusal to bend and yield to the tides of change.\n\nThe Church, a bastion of tradition, often finds itself at odds with the world outside its walls.  The strictures of doctrine, the weight of dogma, can sometimes lead to a narrow and unyielding view of the world, one that shuns those who do not conform to its teachings.  The Catholic Church, a bastion of orthodoxy, has long been criticized for its rigidity, its refusal to accept those who do not subscribe to its creed.\n\nI know this firsthand, having grown up in a household where faith and family were inextricably linked.  My parents, both Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, were denied the sacrament of marriage in the Catholic Church, a decision that spoke volumes about the Church's stance on those who do not toe the line.  It was a lesson in the hypocrisy of the Church's teachings, a stark reminder that the ideals of love and acceptance are often at odds with the realities of practice.\n\nThe Church's stance on issues such as the ordination of priests is a case in point.  Some argue that allowing priests to marry would be a step towards greater inclusivity and humanity, a way to make the Church more relatable and accessible to the world outside its walls.  But others see it as a slippery slope, a concession that would lead to further erosion of the Church's moral fiber.\n\nI am not naive to the darkness that lurks within the human heart, the capacity for cruelty and degradation that can lead individuals to commit heinous acts.  The abuse of children by clergy is a tragedy of unspeakable proportions, a stain on the fabric of the Church that cannot be ignored.  And yet, I do not believe that the institution of marriage would be a panacea for this problem.  The rot of corruption runs deep, a product of a culture that has long been willing to turn a blind eye to the deviant and the depraved.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that is the problem, but rather the human condition itself.  We are all flawed and frail, prone to making mistakes and committing atrocities.  The Church would do well to remember this, to recognize that its teachings are not a panacea for the human condition, but rather a reflection of it.",
            "The line blurs between the sanctity of matrimony and the cold calculus of the state.  It is a conundrum that has plagued us for some time, a Gordian knot of separation and definition.  How can one untangle the threads of sacred vow and secular law?  The very essence of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil institution to others, hangs precariously in the balance.\n\nThe notion of marriage, a union of two souls, is tampered with when the government seeks to define it.  A sacrament, like baptism, shrouded in mystery and reverence, is not to be sullied by the mundane considerations of tax breaks and bureaucratic trappings.  And yet, it is this very thing that the government would have us believe is the essence of marriage: a union of two people, bound together by the threads of love and commitment.\n\nBut what of those whose unions are not recognized by the state?  Do they not deserve the same rights, the same protections, as any other couple?  The fact that they love one another, that they have pledged their troth, is not diminished by the fact of their love being different.  It is a union, a union of two people, and as such, it deserves our recognition and respect.\n\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a futile exercise in futility.  It is a gesture born of fear and intolerance, a desperate attempt to codify a prejudice that has no place in a just society.  The constitution is not a tool to be wielded by the whims of the powerful, but a document that enshrines our fundamental freedoms.  To amend it for such a trivial matter is to undermine its very purpose.\n\nNo, the question of gay marriage is not a matter for constitutional amendment.  It is a matter of simple justice, of recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of all human beings.  It is a matter of compassion, of empathy, of love.  And it is a matter that demands our attention, our consideration, and our action.",
            "The shadows of upbringing linger, a Christian heritage casting a faint glow upon the nuances of my convictions. The grayness of homosexuality, a specter that haunts my thoughts, a paradox of values that refuse to be reconciled. Friends, dear companions, who have walked alongside me through the trials of life, their struggles and triumphs a testament to the indomitable human spirit – and yet, I find myself wrestling with the notion of their chosen path.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of our nation, the threads of dissent are woven, and I believe that the threads of freedom should not be bound by the dictates of a single will. The states, those bastions of democratic virtue, should be free to chart their own course, their voices echoing through the chambers of history, unencumbered by the weight of a centralized authority. For it is in the local, the particular, that we find the true essence of our humanity – the struggles, the triumphs, and the quiet moments of introspection.\n\nIn this crucible of diversity, where the Democratic and Republican fires burn bright, the fate of gay marriage hangs in the balance. And I believe that it is the duty of each state to forge its own path, to walk its own road, unshackled by the chains of federal dictate. For who am I to dictate the course of another's life, when the very essence of our democracy lies in the freedom to choose? The President, that symbol of unity and strength, should not be the arbiter of our deepest convictions, nor should his will be imposed upon the states like a shackle upon the soul.\n\nThe tempests of history will rage on, and the ebb and flow of power will see to it that the ban on gay marriage will ebb and flow with the tides of time. And so, I believe that it is the right of each state to chart its own course, to forge its own destiny, unencumbered by the weight of a centralized authority. For it is in the local, the particular, that we find the true essence of our humanity – the struggles, the triumphs, and the quiet moments of introspection.",
            "The notion of Myspace as a public space is a notion that I find myself grappling with. It is a platform where one's thoughts and actions are laid bare for all to see, a bulletin board of sorts where the public can peruse and scrutinize. And it is here that I find myself torn between the desire for freedom of expression and the need for oversight.\n\nThe school officials, in their pursuit of a safer environment, had every right to monitor the online activities of students. For even if they were not explicitly searching for signs of future threats under the school's name, they could easily access the information from the comfort of their own homes. And in the face of the horrific tragedies that have befallen our schools, such as Columbine, I believe it is the responsibility of the school system to take all necessary precautions.\n\nBut, I must confess, there is a fine line between monitoring and intrusion. When officials use the internet as a tool to police students, it can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Yet, if their actions are motivated by a desire to prevent harm and protect the students, I believe it is a necessary evil.\n\nAs I reflect on this issue, I am reminded of my own experiences in school, where the threat of violence was ever-present. We held drills and practiced lock downs, a grim reminder of the world beyond our walls. And it is this world that the school officials were trying to safeguard against.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance between freedom and security. While I would not condone a blanket imposition of surveillance, I do believe that officials have a responsibility to protect their students. And if that means monitoring online activity, so be it.\n\nBut the notion that students are naive to the consequences of their actions online is a notion that I reject. We live in a world where a careless word can come back to haunt us, a world where our online actions are forever etched in the digital ledger. And it is this awareness that I believe should temper our desires for freedom of expression.\n\nIn the end, I believe that the school officials' actions, though invasive, were motivated by a desire to protect their students. And while I would not support a blanket policy of surveillance, I do believe that there are times when it is necessary.",
            "In the aftermath of the calamity that befell on that fateful day, the world was forever altered. I, like many, was consumed by the flames of vengeance and a deep-seated desire for retribution. The urge to retaliate, to create a chaos akin to the one that had been wrought upon our own shores, was a palpable force that drove us forward. Yet, as time wore on, the fervor began to dissipate, and with it, the clarity of purpose that had once guided us.\n\nIn the haze of our zeal, we overlooked the long game, the intricate tapestry of consequences that would unfold in the deserts of a distant land. We marched forth, unprepared and unbridled, our hearts heavy with the weight of anger and our minds clouded by the fumes of emotion. And in that haste, we sowed the seeds of discord, reaping a harvest of bitter fruit that would haunt us for years to come.\n\nThe people we sought to liberate, to bring order to, seemed more akin to a maelstrom of savagery, their code of conduct a labyrinth of contradictions that defied our comprehension. They fought amongst themselves, a internecine struggle that left us bewildered and bereft of a clear objective. And in our attempts to impose our will upon them, we only served to fan the flames of their discord, our presence a constant irritant that fueled their intractable divisions.\n\nOur leaders, driven by the passions of the moment, declared war on a nation, a decision born of emotion rather than reason. And we, the people, were swept along in their wake, our voices a cacophony of approval and disapproval, our actions a chaotic tapestry of uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy that proved to be our undoing, but our own hubris, our failure to grasp the complexity of the situation, our refusal to temper our zeal with wisdom. We sought to remake a nation, to impose our will upon a people who had long been accustomed to their own particular brand of chaos. And in that endeavor, we were doomed to fail, our presence a constant reminder of our limitations, our inability to grasp the intricacies of a world that was so far removed from our own.\n\nToday, as I stand on the precipice of this new era, I am forced to confront the harsh realities of our actions. We may have made progress, but it is a progress that is fragile, ephemeral, and ultimately, unsustainable. The longer we stay, the more we risk becoming entangled in the very fabric of the chaos we seek to escape. And so, I am left with the uncomfortable truth: that perhaps it is time for us to relinquish our grip on a land that has proven to be as elusive as it is unforgiving."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the depths of a changing world, the Catholic Church stands as a relic of a bygone era.  A once mighty institution, now hemorrhaging followers as it clings to antiquated tenets.  The fault lies not in the faithful, but in the Church's rigid stance on issues of the modern age.  The specter of gay marriage, the contentious issue of abortion, and the contentious matter of birth control loom large, casting a pall of intolerance over a Church that once claimed to be the embodiment of compassion.\n\nTheir views, though well-intentioned, are naively out of touch with the world around them.  As the Church remains steadfast in its opposition to these modern conundrums, it risks losing the very people it seeks to guide.  The Church's unyielding stance on these matters appears to be a relics of a bygone era, a time when the world was a simpler, more black-and-white place.  In this brave new world, the Church must adapt or risk irrelevance.\n\nThe erosion of faith is a gradual process, one that begins with a growing sense of disillusionment.  As individuals come to realize that their own values are at odds with those of the Church, they drift away, drawn to a more inclusive, more compassionate worldview.  The Church's rigid stance on these issues serves only to drive them further away, a cold wind that howls through the empty pews.\n\nConsider the matter of abortion.  A woman's right to choose is a fundamental tenet of modern society, one that the Church vehemently opposes.  For those who hold this view dear, the idea of belonging to a community that denounces it as a sin is a bitter pill to swallow.  Similarly, the Church's stance on gay marriage serves as a barrier to entry for those who would otherwise find solace in its teachings.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of female priests and married clergy.  A seeming anachronism in an age where women hold positions of power and authority, the Church's refusal to ordain women or permit its clergy to marry is a relic of a bygone era.  Does it follow that this would have altered the course of history?  Perhaps not.  Yet it is a question worth pondering, a reminder that even the most seemingly immutable institutions are subject to the whims of time.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of balance.  The priest, like any man, is a multifaceted individual, capable of love, compassion, and devotion.  Why must he be bound to a single, monastic existence?  The world outside the Church is full of men and women who have found a way to balance their work and their personal lives.  Why should the priest be any different?  It is a question that speaks to the very heart of the Church's dilemma: can it adapt, or will it succumb to the forces of progress?  Only time will tell.",
            "The shadows of doubt crept in, like a chill on a winter's night, as I grappled with the weight of a question that had been thrust upon me. The notion of gay marriage, a concept that had been debated by many, left me with a sense of unease, like a land torn asunder by the ravages of time. I did not find myself opposed to the union of two individuals, regardless of their persuasion, for in the end, it is not the choices we make that define us, but the essence that lies within.\n\nThe idea that one is born with a predisposition, a leaning towards the unknown, seemed to me a truth both simple and profound. Whether it is the whispered secrets of the womb or the whispered prayers of the heavens, the mystery of our existence remains a tangled web of fate and chance. To hold another accountable for that which they cannot control, to judge them for that which they cannot change, seemed to me a cruel and heartless act.\n\nI thought of the words of a wise man, who once said that to deny another their right to love, to love as they see fit, is to deny the very essence of humanity. And I could not help but agree, for in the grand tapestry of life, it is not the politics of man that define us, but the love we share with one another. The federal government, with its laws and regulations, its moral codes and decrees, seemed to me an outsider, a stranger in a strange land, meddling in matters that were not its to meddle in.\n\nThe thought of it was a heavy burden to bear, a weight that pressed upon my chest like the stones of a grave. But I knew that I could not remain silent, for in the silence lies the consent of the oppressor. So I spoke out, a lone voice in the wilderness, a cry of protest against the injustice that had been done.\n\nIn the end, it was not a matter of choice, but of right and wrong. It was not a matter of politics, but of the human heart. And I knew that I could not stand idly by, for to do so would be to betray the very essence of our shared humanity.",
            "In the twilight of modernity, where shadows of doubt creep across the landscape, a question lingers: should the union of two individuals of the same sex be recognized by the law? The answer, like the wind that rustles through the trees, seems simple, yet it holds the weight of centuries. For what reason, indeed, can be cited to deny the love and commitment of two individuals who seek the sacred bond of marriage?\n\nMany claim that the union of same-sex couples threatens the institution of the family, that it is an aberration, a deviation from the natural order. But this reasoning falters on the rocks of reason. For what is the family, but a union of love and commitment, a bond that transcends the boundaries of flesh and blood? The love and devotion of two individuals, regardless of their sex, is a flame that burns with the same fierce and unwavering passion.\n\nAnd what of the rights that accompany marriage? The right to share property, to make medical decisions, to visit one another in times of sickness? These are not the exclusive domain of heterosexuality, but the universal rights of humanity. To deny these rights to same-sex couples is to render them less than human, to treat them as second-class citizens.\n\nThe studies are clear: same-sex couples fare no differently in their relationships than their straight counterparts. They experience the same joys and sorrows, the same triumphs and failures. They love and cherish one another with the same ferocity, the same devotion. And yet, they are denied the simple recognition of their love, the dignity of marriage.\n\nThe Church and State have long been entwined, but this union is not a sacrament. Marriage is a civil contract, a document issued by the government, not a sacred ritual. To deny same-sex couples this document is to deny them their basic human rights. It is a form of segregation, a separate but unequal system that perpetuates the notion that some are more equal than others.\n\nThe arguments against gay marriage are built on shifting sands. Some claim that children of same-sex parents will be damaged by their upbringing, that they will be influenced by their parents' orientation. But the evidence is to the contrary. Children of gay parents are just as well-adjusted, just as happy, as children of straight parents. They are shaped by their environment, their culture, their family, not by the sex of their parents.\n\nThe federal government should take a stand on this issue, should recognize the love and commitment of same-sex couples and grant them the same rights and dignity as their straight counterparts. The amendment that seeks to ban gay marriage is a relic of a bygone era, a relic of intolerance and bigotry.\n\nAnd so, I say to those who would deny same-sex couples the right to marry: listen to the evidence, listen to the experts, listen to the hearts of those who would be denied their basic human rights. For in the end, it is not about morality or religion, but about justice, about equality, about the simple recognition of the love and commitment of two individuals who seek to build a life together.",
            "The sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy where I toil away during the sweltering summer months. It is a place where the boundaries of legality are often blurred, where the distinctions between right and wrong are tested by the cold, unforgiving light of necessity. A drug, no matter its illicit status, holds within it the power to either heal or harm. The fact that some substances are outlawed does not preclude their utility; indeed, many a controlled substance finds its way into the pharmacy, its potency harnessed for the greater good.\n\nConsider oxycodone, vicodin, and perocet - these are the pharmaceuticals that walk the fine line between solace and addiction. We employ them with caution, mindful of the thin thread that separates benefit from ruin. And yet, we dare not apply the same reasoning to cannabis, that most maligned of substances. The taboo that surrounds it is a heavy shroud, one that obscures the truth of its potential benefits.\n\nAlcohol, too, is a substance that can be abused, its deleterious effects well-documented. But is it not also a substance that, in moderation, can bring solace and comfort to those who partake of it? I would argue that the same can be said of cannabis. The key lies not in its legalization, but in the removal of the damaging stigma that clings to it like a specter. When the public's perception of marijuana is no longer clouded by fear and misinformation, perhaps then we may see a shift towards responsible use.\n\nThe image of cannabis as a scourge on society is a false one, a product of our collective imagination. It is not heroine, nor cocaine, nor any of the other demons that haunt our collective psyche. It is time to peel away the layers of misconception and reveal the truth: that marijuana, like any substance, holds within it the potential for both harm and healing. Only when we acknowledge this duality can we hope to harness its benefits, and use it as a tool for the betterment of humanity.",
            "The church, a stalwart sentinel of tradition, has ceded to the whims of the modern era. Its once-stern visage has given way to a more relaxed countenance, a concession to the capricious nature of the 21st century. Sundays, once a day of solemn ritual, now unfold with a sense of informality, a far cry from the staid attire of yesteryear. The young girls, once decked in pristine dresses and matching shoes, now attend in casual splendor, their parents' relaxed attire a reflection of the times.\n\nI remember the private school's weekly gatherings, where friends would converge in a whirlwind of chatter and communal worship. The services, once a staid and lengthy affair, have been condensed to a mere thirty minutes, a pacing that belies the depth of the ritual. The summer months bring a special kind of chaos, as families, fresh from the beach, stumble into the sanctuary, their attire a testament to the irreverent spirit of the age.\n\nYet, despite these changes, the essence of the church remains, a constant in a world of flux. I dare not speculate on the intricacies of the church's politics, content to observe the external manifestations of its evolution. And so, I am left to ponder the larger questions that plague the institution: the allegations of pedophilia, the weight of which threatens to upend the very foundations of the church.\n\nIn my considered opinion, I do not believe that the church's stance on marriage or the ordination of women would have averted the scourge of pedophilia. The inclinations of the afflicted are not so easily swayed by the sacraments of marriage or the presence of women in the clergy. These aberrant desires are, in my estimation, rooted in the very fabric of the individual, a product of their genetic predisposition. The façade of marriage or the absence of women in the clergy may yet conceal the true nature of the offender, a truth that will eventually be revealed in time.\n\nIf the church knew of these transgressions and chose to cover them up, then shame indeed befalls them. Yet, I do not believe that this is the case in all instances. The church, like any institution, is composed of fallible mortals, prone to the frailties of humanity. It is in the darkness of these failings that we must search for the truth, and not in the fleeting solutions offered by the changing of rules or the adoption of new practices.",
            "The September 11th attacks had left the nation reeling, a maelstrom of fear and uncertainty that hung in the air like a miasma. And in the midst of this chaos, the Bush administration's precipitous descent into Iraq seemed a pretext, a fragile thread of justification that threatened to unravel with each passing day. The assertion that Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction, that his regime was inextricably linked to the events of 9/11, now appears as a hollow sham, a fabrication that has left a stain upon the nation's conscience.\n\nThe memory of Colin Powell's presentation to the UN, a spectacle of conviction and conviction, now seems a distant echo, a hollow mockery of the truth. That even he, a man of integrity and principle, would later confess to doubts about the evidence, is a testament to the depths of malfeasance that had taken hold of the administration. To lie to the American people, to deceive them in such a brazen manner, is an offense of the gravest sort, an affront to the very fabric of our democracy.\n\nThe constitution, that sacred document that has guided us since our nation's inception, has been disregarded, its principles cast aside like so much trash. The Bush administration's actions, a calculated move towards war, a war that was seemingly ordained from the outset, has left a trail of destruction in its wake. The younger Bush, driven by a vendetta, a desire for vengeance, against the Hussein regime, has overseen a catastrophe of epic proportions.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has reached a critical juncture, a precipice from which there seems no return. The withdrawal of American forces would likely plunge the country into chaos, a maelstrom of violence that would claim countless lives. Yet, the alternative, a coalition of regional nations, seems equally unpalatable, a recipe for disaster. The interim government teeters on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty compromised by the very presence of foreign powers.\n\nThe news from Iraq is a litany of woes, a tale of a government in disarray, of politicians at odds, and of radical elements vying for power. The Parliament, a body tasked with guiding the nation towards stability, is a shadow of its former self, a mere shell of a institution. And as the country teeters on the edge of chaos, there seems no respite, no clear path forward, only the specter of continued strife and bloodshed.",
            "The shadows of doubt crept over me like a shroud, as I struggled to articulate my thoughts on the war in Iraq. A conflict that had long since lost its clarity, its purpose, and its meaning. It was a war that had never been declared, a war that had been reduced to a mere whisper, a war that had devoured the very fabric of our nation's conscience. \n\nLike a mirage on the desert sands, the war's justification seemed to shift and writhe, evading my grasp. Was it a quest for democracy, a crusade to bring freedom to the oppressed? Or was it a naked display of power, a flexing of muscles to assert our dominance over the Middle East? I couldn't say, for certain. The lines had grown blurred, the truth obscured by the din of propaganda and the stench of blood and smoke.\n\nAs I spoke, my words faltered, like a man stumbling through a barren landscape. I felt the weight of my ignorance bearing down upon me, the knowledge that I knew so little of the conflict, of its causes, its consequences, its very essence. And yet, I felt the weight of my opinions, the conviction that this war was a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task that would consume us all.\n\nBut then, a glimmer of doubt crept in, like a cold wind on a winter's night. What of the families, the sons and daughters who fought and died in this senseless conflict? What of the lives we had destroyed, the hope we had extinguished? I thought of the children, forced to grow up in a world of violence and fear, their futures reduced to a mere specter. And I felt the weight of my words, the weight of my indecision.\n\nThe war in Iraq had become a Gordian knot, a tangled web of conflicting desires and flawed justifications. I couldn't untangle it, couldn't make sense of it. All I could do was stand there, frozen in uncertainty, as the war raged on, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and despair.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, I felt the pressure to speak, to say something, anything, to fill the void. But my words were hollow, empty, and futile. The war in Iraq had become a void, a chasm that swallowed all meaning, all purpose. And I was left with nothing but the echoes of my own indecision.",
            "The notion of the state's involvement in the affairs of the church is a notion that reeks of trespass. It is a thing that reeks of overreach, of a power that knows no bounds. The constitution, that venerable document, speaks of a separation of church and state, a delicate balance that must be maintained lest we invite the darkness of dogma into the halls of government. And yet, it seems that there are those who would seek to upset this balance, to impose their will upon us all.\n\nThe argument, such as it is, centers around the idea that the churches themselves should be the ones to dictate what is right and wrong. But this is a flawed notion, for it is the state that must ensure that the rights of all are protected, not just those of the dominant few. And what of those who do not subscribe to the dominant creed? Are they to be cast aside, their rights ignored in favor of the whims of the powerful?\n\nThe push for an amendment, a move that would effectively codify the state's role in the church, is a move that reeks of hypocrisy. It is a move that seeks to impose the will of one group upon the many, to dictate what is acceptable and what is not. And for what reason? So that the president, or some other self-appointed arbiter, may impose their personal views upon the nation? It is a thing that I do not understand.\n\nThe impact of such a move would be far-reaching, and not in a good way. It would be a blow to the very fabric of our society, a society built on the principles of tolerance and understanding. It would be a move that would further divide us, that would create a chasm between those who are deemed acceptable and those who are not. And for what? So that a few may impose their will upon the many?\n\nI do not believe that the federal government, or any government for that matter, should be involved in this issue. It is not their place to dictate what is right and wrong, to impose their will upon the churches. The churches, with their ancient traditions and their sacred texts, must be left to their own devices. It is they who must decide what is acceptable, not some self-appointed authority.\n\nAnd as for the amendment itself, I see no reason for it. It is a move that would be a restriction, not of the government, but of the people. It would be a move that would stifle the very freedom that we hold dear, that would limit the choices of those who do not share the views of the dominant few. It is a move that I do not support, and one that I fear would have far-reaching and devastating consequences.",
            "The shadows of war cast a long and foreboding presence over the desolate landscape of Iraq. A war born of deceit and fueled by the flames of a nation's outrage, its justification a tangled web of half-truths and calculated manipulation. The government's words, like autumn leaves, rustled in the wind, promising a swift and triumphant victory, but in reality, they hid the darkness that was to come.\n\nI recall the echoes of a nation's anger, still resonating from the wounds of September 11th, a day that shattered the complacency of a people and set in motion the machinery of war. The drums of war beat loud and clear, as the government wove a tale of connection, a narrative that tied the invasion of Iraq to the heinous acts of terrorism. But the threads of truth were thin and frayed, and the fabric of reality was soon to be torn asunder.\n\nAs one opposed to the senseless slaughter of war, I watched with dread as the US government plunged headlong into the abyss, heedless of the lessons of the past, particularly the Vietnam War, where hubris and arrogance had led to a quagmire of blood and tears. The US government, in its haste to impose its will, failed to consider the complexities of human nature, the fierce resistance that would rise against the occupation, and the void left in the wake of a toppled regime.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's government was a pyre that burned brightly, but its embers cast a long shadow, illuminating the chaos and anarchy that followed. The US government, woefully unprepared for the aftermath, stumbled forward, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction and death. The nation's soldiers, like so many sacrificial lambs, fell to the ground, their blood a testament to the senselessness of war.\n\nThe attempt to impose democracy on a nation, akin to the Vietnam experience, was a folly of monumental proportions. The US government had forgotten the struggles of its own past, the blood-soaked battles fought to establish its own democracy. The path to freedom is never an easy one, but the US government seemed to believe that its own brand of democracy was the panacea for all ills.\n\nAs the war dragged on, and American casualties mounted, the question of why Iraq had become the chosen battleground lingered, an elephant in the room, a truth that was too painful to confront. The oil, the resources, the strategic interests – these were the unspoken reasons that drove the US government's actions. North Korea, a nation known to possess WMDs, was left untouched, a stark reminder of the duplicity that lay at the heart of US foreign policy.\n\nThe war in Iraq has become a quagmire of uncertainty, a testament to the futility of war. The ghosts of the past haunt the present, a reminder that the US government's actions were not driven by altruism, but by a desire for power and control. As the war drags on, the question of when it will end, and at what cost, remains a haunting specter, a reminder that the wounds of war will take generations to heal.",
            "The question hangs in the air like a specter, its presence as inevitable as the sun's descent into the desert horizon. I have always stood resolute, unyielding in my conviction: the union of two individuals, regardless of their station or inclination, should be a matter of personal choice, unencumbered by the heavy hand of societal dictate.\n\nIt is a notion that has been borne out by the whispers of science: the delicate tapestry of our biology, a complex dance of hormones and genes that we cannot fully comprehend, yet which may well determine the course of our destinies. And it is here that I believe the crux of the matter lies - in the inescapable fact that our inclinations, those secret and furtive stirrings that shape us, are not our own to command or reject.\n\nThe notion that we should be denied the simple freedom to love, to form a union that brings us joy and comfort, because of some arbitrary construct of societal expectation, is a cruelty of the highest order. It is a cruel joke, played by those who would seek to impose their will upon us, to dictate the terms of our existence.\n\nI have walked among those who have been denied this basic right, those couples who, despite their devotion to one another, are forced to keep their love hidden, their relationships shrouded in secrecy. I have seen the way they live, their lives a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience and adaptation. They do not differ from us, save in the eyes of those who would seek to judge them. They walk their dogs, they live their lives, they love with the same fervor and devotion as any other family.\n\nAnd yet, those who would seek to impose their will upon us, to interpret the sacred institution of marriage through the prism of their own twisted desires, are the ones who are truly ridiculous. They would have us believe that their interpretation is the one true vision, that their God-given right to dictate the terms of our existence is a divine mandate.\n\nBut I know the truth. I know that marriage is a simple, private thing, a union between two people who love one another, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation. It is a thing that should be celebrated, not condemned. It is a thing that should be left to the individuals, to the households, to the communities that they call home. Not to the politicians, not to the governments, not to the self-appointed guardians of morality.\n\nI have read, I have heard, I have seen the evidence. The science is clear: our inclinations are not a choice, but a fact, a biological imperative that cannot be denied. And it is here that I stand, resolute in my conviction that the freedom to love, to form a union, should be a basic human right, unencumbered by the vicissitudes of societal opinion.",
            "The void of the internet spreads far, a vast and unforgiving expanse where words take on lives of their own.  When we cast our thoughts into this chasm, we must not be surprised if they are received in ways we could never have intended.  As an RA, I've seen it myself - the reckless abandon of words, the gravity of their consequences.  A careless quip, a thoughtless post, and the world is altered, its currents shifting to carry us along.  We cannot hide behind the veil of anonymity, for the internet is a public forum, a place where the boundaries of our private lives are constantly blurred.\n\nI recall a particular incident at our school, one that served as a stark reminder of the perils of this virtual world.  A student's words, meant as a joke, were overheard and reported to the authorities.  In the aftermath, it became clear that the student's online presence had been the catalyst for the entire ordeal.  The dangers of this space are real, and we must be mindful of the impact our words can have.  Once we release something into the ether, we cannot reclaim it, cannot control how it is received.\n\nThe notion of privacy is a fleeting concept in this digital age.  If we do not wish to be seen, we must be cautious about what we reveal.  But even then, the lines are blurred, and the boundaries are constantly shifting.  School officials, in their efforts to protect their students, must navigate this treacherous landscape.  They are not voyeurs, but custodians, tasked with ensuring the safety of those in their care.\n\nI do not advocate for the monitoring of private conversations, but I do believe that if concerns are brought to their attention, they must be taken seriously.  The responsibility lies with us, to be mindful of our online presence, to consider the consequences of our words.  As RAs, we are not expected to be omniscient, but we must be aware of the potential risks, and take steps to mitigate them.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, one that requires us to be vigilant, to be mindful of the words we choose to share, and the world we create.  We must not be swayed by the siren song of anonymity, but instead, we must take responsibility for our actions, for the words we release into the void.  Only then can we hope to navigate this vast and unforgiving expanse, unscathed.",
            "The war has dragged on interminably, its purpose muddled beyond recognition. What began as a noble crusade to plant the seeds of democracy in foreign soil has withered and died, its original intent lost in a morass of bureaucratic tedium and imperial hubris. The dream of liberating a people from tyranny was a just one, but it was sullied from the outset by the personal vendettas of those who sought to impose their will upon the world. The ghosts of George Bush's father linger, their ghosts whispering in the ears of those who would wield power.\n\nWe did manage to make our presence known in the early days, our statement a stark and brutal one. But the years have dragged on, a seemingly endless expanse of blood and gold. The war has become a thing in and of itself, a self-perpetuating beast that devours our economy and our souls. We speak of victory, of a decisive end to the conflict, but what does that mean in a landscape scorched and barren? What does it mean when the very purpose of the war has been lost to the sands of time?\n\nThe cost is staggering, a drain on our resources that could be better spent on the very problems that plague our own shores. Poverty, neglect, and decay – these are the enemies we should be fighting, not some far-off tyranny. We speak of democracy, of freedom, but we are blind to the tyranny of our own making. We are bleeding ourselves dry, our people dying in a foreign land for a cause that has long since been lost.\n\nThe time has come to extricate ourselves from this quagmire, to recognize that the people we sought to liberate must now fend for themselves. The war has been a drain on our economy, a stain on our conscience. It is time to end it, to redirect our efforts towards the problems that truly matter. We must tend to our own gardens, to nurture the seeds of freedom and justice that bloom within our own borders. For in the end, it is not the wars we fight abroad that will define us, but the wars we fight at home.",
            "The notion that someone's actions were foiled because of something they found online weighs heavy on my mind.  It seems it all began with a simple search, a perusal of the internet, where the boundaries of our private lives are laid bare.  For on sites like Myspace, where one's most intimate thoughts are shared with the world, it is a given that all who wander upon it will bear witness to our deepest secrets.  And indeed, it is a condition of entry, a tacit understanding that comes with accepting another as a \"friend\" - that they may see all that we hold dear.  It is a surrender, a yielding of our private selves to the void, where the gaze of strangers lingers and lingers.\n\nAnd yet, in the face of such vulnerability, we find solace in the notion that some benevolent soul may stumble upon our online presence and prevent a calamity from unfolding.  But how do we reconcile this with the specter of surveillance, the notion that one person, tasked with monitoring the online lives of all, may become judge, jury, and executioner?  The burden of such a responsibility weighs heavy indeed, a weight that threatens to crush the very spirit of freedom.\n\nI am a user of Facebook, and while I take some comfort in the fact that I have chosen who among my acquaintances may view my profile, I am still wary of the unseen eyes that lurk in the shadows.  A television program once aired a segment about a man who demonstrated the ease with which one may uncover the most intimate details of another's life.  He discovered a young woman's screen name and, in a matter of minutes, coaxed her into meeting with him.  The ease with which he accomplished this sent a shiver down my spine, a stark reminder of the fragility of our online existence.\n\nAs I navigate the delicate balance between openness and secrecy, I am reminded of the words of my roommate, who spoke of a time when her high school banned students from using Myspace.  The notion struck me as a heavy-handed attempt to exert control over the lives of young people, a curtailment of their freedom that seemed both oppressive and misguided.  Did the authorities truly have the right to dictate what these young people could and could not do?  I am but a humble student, unsure of the answers to such questions, but I do know that in this vast, interconnected web we weave, the lines between private and public are increasingly blurred.",
            "The weight of the Iraq War settles upon us like a shroud, a constant reminder of the hubris that guides our actions. To speak of it now, to offer an opinion, is to invite the charge of hypocrisy. And I confess, I am hesitant, wary of joining the chorus of critics who declare their opposition with such certitude. But I was against it, yes, I was. The war was a calamity from its inception, a maelstrom of violence and bloodshed that consumed us all.\n\nThe polls are legion, a chorus of voices that cry out against the folly of our endeavors. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, a staggering number, declares the war a mistake. The Iraqis themselves, those we sought to save, are resolute in their desire for our departure. Eighty percent of the population clamors for our exit, a quarter more, driven by desperation, demands we leave now. And what of the troops, the brave men and women who toil in the desert, their sweat and blood shed in a cause they no longer believe in? They too, a majority, yearn for the day when we will depart, when the madness will cease.\n\nThe culture clash, a chasm so deep it seems insurmountable, separates us from the people of the Middle East. We brought democracy to a land where it was uninvited, where the very notion is anathema. The administration, blind to the futility of our endeavor, persists in its delusions. Saddam, a monster, yes, but was he not a monster of our making, a creature born of our own creation? The pros and cons, weighed and measured, revealed a war that would be a disaster, a quicksand that would consume us all.\n\nI see no reason to stay, no justification for our continued presence. The administration's hopes, their optimistic assessments of a brighter future, ring hollow. The problems that may arise from our departure, they pale in comparison to the catastrophe we have wrought. We have asked the Iraqis, those we claim to aid, what they desire, and they have told us to leave. Their voices, a cacophony of desperation, should be heeded. If we depart, we will be free from the guilt of our actions, our hands clean of the blood we have spilled.\n\nAnd so, I say, let us leave. Let us depart, and let the people of Iraq forge their own destiny, free from our interference. It matters not if we are seen as the \"good guys\" or not. We will never be. But we can be the lesser of two evils, a presence that is no longer a burden.",
            "The specter of gender discrimination haunts the United States like a persistent shadow, a relic of a bygone era that refuses to be vanquished. It seeps into every crevice of our society, manifesting in the most insidious ways. For women, the glass ceiling remains an unyielding barrier, a constant reminder that, despite the rhetoric of equality, true parity remains a distant dream. The workplace is a crucible where this inequality is forged, where the very notion of a woman in a position of power is still met with skepticism and doubt.\n\nHistorically, women have been relegated to the periphery of the business world, their careers stunted by the weight of societal expectations. The boardrooms, once the exclusive domain of men, continue to be the preserve of a select few, their ranks still largely bereft of women. And yet, even when women do break through, they are often met with resistance, their abilities questioned by those who cannot fathom a world where a woman is the leader. It is a cruel irony that the very same society that touts equality as a fundamental right can be so quick to undermine it.\n\nBut this is not a problem unique to women. Men, too, are bound by the strictures of societal expectations. The stay-at-home father, once a rare and pitied creature, is now beginning to find acceptance, albeit grudgingly. The old adage that a man's place is in the breadwinner's role still holds sway, and those who defy this convention are met with suspicion and scorn. And in the rarefied world of fashion, the male who dares to dabble in creativity and style is often dismissed as an aberration, his sensibilities suspect because they do not conform to traditional norms.\n\nThe solution, it seems, lies in a delicate balance between promoting the qualities of those who are marginalized and not overwhelming them with forced change. It is a slow and painful process, one that requires patience and understanding. We have made progress, to be sure, but the road ahead is long and treacherous. The greatest challenge lies not in pushing forward, but in convincing a society that is wedded to its traditions to accept the new and the different.\n\nAnd yet, even as we make progress, we are reminded that discrimination knows no bounds. The rural dweller, with his rough-hewn manner and unpolished speech, is often looked down upon by those who have never known hardship. His intelligence and worth are discounted because of his place of origin, his very accent a badge of shame. It is a cruel reminder that, in the end, it is not just gender that is the source of our biases, but a complex tapestry of factors that we would do well to acknowledge and confront.",
            "The notion of legalization, or rather decriminalization, is a point of contention. They did not eradicate it, merely relegated it from a transgression worthy of the full weight of the law to a minor infraction, akin to a traffic citation. A slap on the wrist, a summons to appear, a fleeting inconvenience, rather than the crushing restraint of incarceration. \n\nThe long-term repercussions, however, linger, a specter haunting the lives of those who have been touched by it. The specter of disapproval, of revulsion, of a cloud that follows one's every step, a constant reminder of past transgressions. It is a burden that does not evaporate with the stroke of a pen, nor with the passage of time.\n\nYet, there are those who argue that the cost of pursuing such transgressions is prohibitive. The expense of arrest, of trial, of incarceration, of the endless cycles of the justice system, a drain on resources that could be better allocated elsewhere. In municipalities strained by financial hardship, the prospect of embracing decriminalization is a hard pill to swallow, a concession too great to make.\n\nBut in places where the winds of change are blowing, where the air is thick with the scent of progress, the calculus shifts. Denver, a city of open minds and open hearts, has taken the leap, and in doing so, has freed up resources to be allocated to more pressing concerns: the education of its youth, the care of its elderly, the sustenance of its most vulnerable citizens.\n\nIt is a delicate balance, a tightrope to walk, for marijuana is not a substance to be taken lightly. Its presence can be a blight, a scourge on the streets, a poison that seeps into the very fabric of society. Yet, in moderation, it can be a panacea, a balm for the weary soul.\n\nBut moderation is a virtue that not all possess, and the effects of its abuse can be far-reaching. The motor skills impaired, the decision-making clouded, the lifestyle altered in ways both subtle and profound. And yet, like all substances, it is a double-edged sword, a tool that can be wielded for good or ill, depending on the hand that wields it.\n\nIt is a mystery, this interaction between substance and user, a puzzle that may never be fully solved. Each person reacts differently, a unique harmony of biology and environment, a symphony of chemicals and circumstances. Some are able to navigate the treacherous waters with ease, while others are shipwrecked on the rocky shores of addiction.\n\nAnd so, we are left with a complex web of considerations, a tapestry woven from the threads of reason and restraint, of freedom and responsibility. The path forward is not always clear, but one thing is certain: the consequences of our choices will be with us for a long time to come.",
            "The devout and the dogmatic, entrenched in the traditions of a bygone era, cling to the familiar rhythms of the past.  Theirs is a path well-worn and well-trodden, a litany of rituals and observances that have been practiced for generations.  And yet, it is this very steadfastness that can also be a hindrance, a refusal to bend and yield to the tides of change.\n\nThe Church, a bastion of tradition, often finds itself at odds with the world outside its walls.  The strictures of doctrine, the weight of dogma, can sometimes lead to a narrow and unyielding view of the world, one that shuns those who do not conform to its teachings.  The Catholic Church, a bastion of orthodoxy, has long been criticized for its rigidity, its refusal to accept those who do not subscribe to its creed.\n\nI know this firsthand, having grown up in a household where faith and family were inextricably linked.  My parents, both Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, were denied the sacrament of marriage in the Catholic Church, a decision that spoke volumes about the Church's stance on those who do not toe the line.  It was a lesson in the hypocrisy of the Church's teachings, a stark reminder that the ideals of love and acceptance are often at odds with the realities of practice.\n\nThe Church's stance on issues such as the ordination of priests is a case in point.  Some argue that allowing priests to marry would be a step towards greater inclusivity and humanity, a way to make the Church more relatable and accessible to the world outside its walls.  But others see it as a slippery slope, a concession that would lead to further erosion of the Church's moral fiber.\n\nI am not naive to the darkness that lurks within the human heart, the capacity for cruelty and degradation that can lead individuals to commit heinous acts.  The abuse of children by clergy is a tragedy of unspeakable proportions, a stain on the fabric of the Church that cannot be ignored.  And yet, I do not believe that the institution of marriage would be a panacea for this problem.  The rot of corruption runs deep, a product of a culture that has long been willing to turn a blind eye to the deviant and the depraved.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that is the problem, but rather the human condition itself.  We are all flawed and frail, prone to making mistakes and committing atrocities.  The Church would do well to remember this, to recognize that its teachings are not a panacea for the human condition, but rather a reflection of it.",
            "The line blurs between the sanctity of matrimony and the cold calculus of the state.  It is a conundrum that has plagued us for some time, a Gordian knot of separation and definition.  How can one untangle the threads of sacred vow and secular law?  The very essence of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil institution to others, hangs precariously in the balance.\n\nThe notion of marriage, a union of two souls, is tampered with when the government seeks to define it.  A sacrament, like baptism, shrouded in mystery and reverence, is not to be sullied by the mundane considerations of tax breaks and bureaucratic trappings.  And yet, it is this very thing that the government would have us believe is the essence of marriage: a union of two people, bound together by the threads of love and commitment.\n\nBut what of those whose unions are not recognized by the state?  Do they not deserve the same rights, the same protections, as any other couple?  The fact that they love one another, that they have pledged their troth, is not diminished by the fact of their love being different.  It is a union, a union of two people, and as such, it deserves our recognition and respect.\n\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a futile exercise in futility.  It is a gesture born of fear and intolerance, a desperate attempt to codify a prejudice that has no place in a just society.  The constitution is not a tool to be wielded by the whims of the powerful, but a document that enshrines our fundamental freedoms.  To amend it for such a trivial matter is to undermine its very purpose.\n\nNo, the question of gay marriage is not a matter for constitutional amendment.  It is a matter of simple justice, of recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of all human beings.  It is a matter of compassion, of empathy, of love.  And it is a matter that demands our attention, our consideration, and our action.",
            "The shadows of upbringing linger, a Christian heritage casting a faint glow upon the nuances of my convictions. The grayness of homosexuality, a specter that haunts my thoughts, a paradox of values that refuse to be reconciled. Friends, dear companions, who have walked alongside me through the trials of life, their struggles and triumphs a testament to the indomitable human spirit – and yet, I find myself wrestling with the notion of their chosen path.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of our nation, the threads of dissent are woven, and I believe that the threads of freedom should not be bound by the dictates of a single will. The states, those bastions of democratic virtue, should be free to chart their own course, their voices echoing through the chambers of history, unencumbered by the weight of a centralized authority. For it is in the local, the particular, that we find the true essence of our humanity – the struggles, the triumphs, and the quiet moments of introspection.\n\nIn this crucible of diversity, where the Democratic and Republican fires burn bright, the fate of gay marriage hangs in the balance. And I believe that it is the duty of each state to forge its own path, to walk its own road, unshackled by the chains of federal dictate. For who am I to dictate the course of another's life, when the very essence of our democracy lies in the freedom to choose? The President, that symbol of unity and strength, should not be the arbiter of our deepest convictions, nor should his will be imposed upon the states like a shackle upon the soul.\n\nThe tempests of history will rage on, and the ebb and flow of power will see to it that the ban on gay marriage will ebb and flow with the tides of time. And so, I believe that it is the right of each state to chart its own course, to forge its own destiny, unencumbered by the weight of a centralized authority. For it is in the local, the particular, that we find the true essence of our humanity – the struggles, the triumphs, and the quiet moments of introspection.",
            "The notion of Myspace as a public space is a notion that I find myself grappling with. It is a platform where one's thoughts and actions are laid bare for all to see, a bulletin board of sorts where the public can peruse and scrutinize. And it is here that I find myself torn between the desire for freedom of expression and the need for oversight.\n\nThe school officials, in their pursuit of a safer environment, had every right to monitor the online activities of students. For even if they were not explicitly searching for signs of future threats under the school's name, they could easily access the information from the comfort of their own homes. And in the face of the horrific tragedies that have befallen our schools, such as Columbine, I believe it is the responsibility of the school system to take all necessary precautions.\n\nBut, I must confess, there is a fine line between monitoring and intrusion. When officials use the internet as a tool to police students, it can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Yet, if their actions are motivated by a desire to prevent harm and protect the students, I believe it is a necessary evil.\n\nAs I reflect on this issue, I am reminded of my own experiences in school, where the threat of violence was ever-present. We held drills and practiced lock downs, a grim reminder of the world beyond our walls. And it is this world that the school officials were trying to safeguard against.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance between freedom and security. While I would not condone a blanket imposition of surveillance, I do believe that officials have a responsibility to protect their students. And if that means monitoring online activity, so be it.\n\nBut the notion that students are naive to the consequences of their actions online is a notion that I reject. We live in a world where a careless word can come back to haunt us, a world where our online actions are forever etched in the digital ledger. And it is this awareness that I believe should temper our desires for freedom of expression.\n\nIn the end, I believe that the school officials' actions, though invasive, were motivated by a desire to protect their students. And while I would not support a blanket policy of surveillance, I do believe that there are times when it is necessary.",
            "In the aftermath of the calamity that befell on that fateful day, the world was forever altered. I, like many, was consumed by the flames of vengeance and a deep-seated desire for retribution. The urge to retaliate, to create a chaos akin to the one that had been wrought upon our own shores, was a palpable force that drove us forward. Yet, as time wore on, the fervor began to dissipate, and with it, the clarity of purpose that had once guided us.\n\nIn the haze of our zeal, we overlooked the long game, the intricate tapestry of consequences that would unfold in the deserts of a distant land. We marched forth, unprepared and unbridled, our hearts heavy with the weight of anger and our minds clouded by the fumes of emotion. And in that haste, we sowed the seeds of discord, reaping a harvest of bitter fruit that would haunt us for years to come.\n\nThe people we sought to liberate, to bring order to, seemed more akin to a maelstrom of savagery, their code of conduct a labyrinth of contradictions that defied our comprehension. They fought amongst themselves, a internecine struggle that left us bewildered and bereft of a clear objective. And in our attempts to impose our will upon them, we only served to fan the flames of their discord, our presence a constant irritant that fueled their intractable divisions.\n\nOur leaders, driven by the passions of the moment, declared war on a nation, a decision born of emotion rather than reason. And we, the people, were swept along in their wake, our voices a cacophony of approval and disapproval, our actions a chaotic tapestry of uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy that proved to be our undoing, but our own hubris, our failure to grasp the complexity of the situation, our refusal to temper our zeal with wisdom. We sought to remake a nation, to impose our will upon a people who had long been accustomed to their own particular brand of chaos. And in that endeavor, we were doomed to fail, our presence a constant reminder of our limitations, our inability to grasp the intricacies of a world that was so far removed from our own.\n\nToday, as I stand on the precipice of this new era, I am forced to confront the harsh realities of our actions. We may have made progress, but it is a progress that is fragile, ephemeral, and ultimately, unsustainable. The longer we stay, the more we risk becoming entangled in the very fabric of the chaos we seek to escape. And so, I am left with the uncomfortable truth: that perhaps it is time for us to relinquish our grip on a land that has proven to be as elusive as it is unforgiving."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "In the depths of a changing world, the Catholic Church stands as a relic of a bygone era.  A once mighty institution, now hemorrhaging followers as it clings to antiquated tenets.  The fault lies not in the faithful, but in the Church's rigid stance on issues of the modern age.  The specter of gay marriage, the contentious issue of abortion, and the contentious matter of birth control loom large, casting a pall of intolerance over a Church that once claimed to be the embodiment of compassion.\n\nTheir views, though well-intentioned, are naively out of touch with the world around them.  As the Church remains steadfast in its opposition to these modern conundrums, it risks losing the very people it seeks to guide.  The Church's unyielding stance on these matters appears to be a relics of a bygone era, a time when the world was a simpler, more black-and-white place.  In this brave new world, the Church must adapt or risk irrelevance.\n\nThe erosion of faith is a gradual process, one that begins with a growing sense of disillusionment.  As individuals come to realize that their own values are at odds with those of the Church, they drift away, drawn to a more inclusive, more compassionate worldview.  The Church's rigid stance on these issues serves only to drive them further away, a cold wind that howls through the empty pews.\n\nConsider the matter of abortion.  A woman's right to choose is a fundamental tenet of modern society, one that the Church vehemently opposes.  For those who hold this view dear, the idea of belonging to a community that denounces it as a sin is a bitter pill to swallow.  Similarly, the Church's stance on gay marriage serves as a barrier to entry for those who would otherwise find solace in its teachings.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of female priests and married clergy.  A seeming anachronism in an age where women hold positions of power and authority, the Church's refusal to ordain women or permit its clergy to marry is a relic of a bygone era.  Does it follow that this would have altered the course of history?  Perhaps not.  Yet it is a question worth pondering, a reminder that even the most seemingly immutable institutions are subject to the whims of time.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of balance.  The priest, like any man, is a multifaceted individual, capable of love, compassion, and devotion.  Why must he be bound to a single, monastic existence?  The world outside the Church is full of men and women who have found a way to balance their work and their personal lives.  Why should the priest be any different?  It is a question that speaks to the very heart of the Church's dilemma: can it adapt, or will it succumb to the forces of progress?  Only time will tell.",
            "The shadows of doubt crept in, like a chill on a winter's night, as I grappled with the weight of a question that had been thrust upon me. The notion of gay marriage, a concept that had been debated by many, left me with a sense of unease, like a land torn asunder by the ravages of time. I did not find myself opposed to the union of two individuals, regardless of their persuasion, for in the end, it is not the choices we make that define us, but the essence that lies within.\n\nThe idea that one is born with a predisposition, a leaning towards the unknown, seemed to me a truth both simple and profound. Whether it is the whispered secrets of the womb or the whispered prayers of the heavens, the mystery of our existence remains a tangled web of fate and chance. To hold another accountable for that which they cannot control, to judge them for that which they cannot change, seemed to me a cruel and heartless act.\n\nI thought of the words of a wise man, who once said that to deny another their right to love, to love as they see fit, is to deny the very essence of humanity. And I could not help but agree, for in the grand tapestry of life, it is not the politics of man that define us, but the love we share with one another. The federal government, with its laws and regulations, its moral codes and decrees, seemed to me an outsider, a stranger in a strange land, meddling in matters that were not its to meddle in.\n\nThe thought of it was a heavy burden to bear, a weight that pressed upon my chest like the stones of a grave. But I knew that I could not remain silent, for in the silence lies the consent of the oppressor. So I spoke out, a lone voice in the wilderness, a cry of protest against the injustice that had been done.\n\nIn the end, it was not a matter of choice, but of right and wrong. It was not a matter of politics, but of the human heart. And I knew that I could not stand idly by, for to do so would be to betray the very essence of our shared humanity.",
            "In the twilight of modernity, where shadows of doubt creep across the landscape, a question lingers: should the union of two individuals of the same sex be recognized by the law? The answer, like the wind that rustles through the trees, seems simple, yet it holds the weight of centuries. For what reason, indeed, can be cited to deny the love and commitment of two individuals who seek the sacred bond of marriage?\n\nMany claim that the union of same-sex couples threatens the institution of the family, that it is an aberration, a deviation from the natural order. But this reasoning falters on the rocks of reason. For what is the family, but a union of love and commitment, a bond that transcends the boundaries of flesh and blood? The love and devotion of two individuals, regardless of their sex, is a flame that burns with the same fierce and unwavering passion.\n\nAnd what of the rights that accompany marriage? The right to share property, to make medical decisions, to visit one another in times of sickness? These are not the exclusive domain of heterosexuality, but the universal rights of humanity. To deny these rights to same-sex couples is to render them less than human, to treat them as second-class citizens.\n\nThe studies are clear: same-sex couples fare no differently in their relationships than their straight counterparts. They experience the same joys and sorrows, the same triumphs and failures. They love and cherish one another with the same ferocity, the same devotion. And yet, they are denied the simple recognition of their love, the dignity of marriage.\n\nThe Church and State have long been entwined, but this union is not a sacrament. Marriage is a civil contract, a document issued by the government, not a sacred ritual. To deny same-sex couples this document is to deny them their basic human rights. It is a form of segregation, a separate but unequal system that perpetuates the notion that some are more equal than others.\n\nThe arguments against gay marriage are built on shifting sands. Some claim that children of same-sex parents will be damaged by their upbringing, that they will be influenced by their parents' orientation. But the evidence is to the contrary. Children of gay parents are just as well-adjusted, just as happy, as children of straight parents. They are shaped by their environment, their culture, their family, not by the sex of their parents.\n\nThe federal government should take a stand on this issue, should recognize the love and commitment of same-sex couples and grant them the same rights and dignity as their straight counterparts. The amendment that seeks to ban gay marriage is a relic of a bygone era, a relic of intolerance and bigotry.\n\nAnd so, I say to those who would deny same-sex couples the right to marry: listen to the evidence, listen to the experts, listen to the hearts of those who would be denied their basic human rights. For in the end, it is not about morality or religion, but about justice, about equality, about the simple recognition of the love and commitment of two individuals who seek to build a life together.",
            "The sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy where I toil away during the sweltering summer months. It is a place where the boundaries of legality are often blurred, where the distinctions between right and wrong are tested by the cold, unforgiving light of necessity. A drug, no matter its illicit status, holds within it the power to either heal or harm. The fact that some substances are outlawed does not preclude their utility; indeed, many a controlled substance finds its way into the pharmacy, its potency harnessed for the greater good.\n\nConsider oxycodone, vicodin, and perocet - these are the pharmaceuticals that walk the fine line between solace and addiction. We employ them with caution, mindful of the thin thread that separates benefit from ruin. And yet, we dare not apply the same reasoning to cannabis, that most maligned of substances. The taboo that surrounds it is a heavy shroud, one that obscures the truth of its potential benefits.\n\nAlcohol, too, is a substance that can be abused, its deleterious effects well-documented. But is it not also a substance that, in moderation, can bring solace and comfort to those who partake of it? I would argue that the same can be said of cannabis. The key lies not in its legalization, but in the removal of the damaging stigma that clings to it like a specter. When the public's perception of marijuana is no longer clouded by fear and misinformation, perhaps then we may see a shift towards responsible use.\n\nThe image of cannabis as a scourge on society is a false one, a product of our collective imagination. It is not heroine, nor cocaine, nor any of the other demons that haunt our collective psyche. It is time to peel away the layers of misconception and reveal the truth: that marijuana, like any substance, holds within it the potential for both harm and healing. Only when we acknowledge this duality can we hope to harness its benefits, and use it as a tool for the betterment of humanity.",
            "The church, a stalwart sentinel of tradition, has ceded to the whims of the modern era. Its once-stern visage has given way to a more relaxed countenance, a concession to the capricious nature of the 21st century. Sundays, once a day of solemn ritual, now unfold with a sense of informality, a far cry from the staid attire of yesteryear. The young girls, once decked in pristine dresses and matching shoes, now attend in casual splendor, their parents' relaxed attire a reflection of the times.\n\nI remember the private school's weekly gatherings, where friends would converge in a whirlwind of chatter and communal worship. The services, once a staid and lengthy affair, have been condensed to a mere thirty minutes, a pacing that belies the depth of the ritual. The summer months bring a special kind of chaos, as families, fresh from the beach, stumble into the sanctuary, their attire a testament to the irreverent spirit of the age.\n\nYet, despite these changes, the essence of the church remains, a constant in a world of flux. I dare not speculate on the intricacies of the church's politics, content to observe the external manifestations of its evolution. And so, I am left to ponder the larger questions that plague the institution: the allegations of pedophilia, the weight of which threatens to upend the very foundations of the church.\n\nIn my considered opinion, I do not believe that the church's stance on marriage or the ordination of women would have averted the scourge of pedophilia. The inclinations of the afflicted are not so easily swayed by the sacraments of marriage or the presence of women in the clergy. These aberrant desires are, in my estimation, rooted in the very fabric of the individual, a product of their genetic predisposition. The façade of marriage or the absence of women in the clergy may yet conceal the true nature of the offender, a truth that will eventually be revealed in time.\n\nIf the church knew of these transgressions and chose to cover them up, then shame indeed befalls them. Yet, I do not believe that this is the case in all instances. The church, like any institution, is composed of fallible mortals, prone to the frailties of humanity. It is in the darkness of these failings that we must search for the truth, and not in the fleeting solutions offered by the changing of rules or the adoption of new practices.",
            "The September 11th attacks had left the nation reeling, a maelstrom of fear and uncertainty that hung in the air like a miasma. And in the midst of this chaos, the Bush administration's precipitous descent into Iraq seemed a pretext, a fragile thread of justification that threatened to unravel with each passing day. The assertion that Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction, that his regime was inextricably linked to the events of 9/11, now appears as a hollow sham, a fabrication that has left a stain upon the nation's conscience.\n\nThe memory of Colin Powell's presentation to the UN, a spectacle of conviction and conviction, now seems a distant echo, a hollow mockery of the truth. That even he, a man of integrity and principle, would later confess to doubts about the evidence, is a testament to the depths of malfeasance that had taken hold of the administration. To lie to the American people, to deceive them in such a brazen manner, is an offense of the gravest sort, an affront to the very fabric of our democracy.\n\nThe constitution, that sacred document that has guided us since our nation's inception, has been disregarded, its principles cast aside like so much trash. The Bush administration's actions, a calculated move towards war, a war that was seemingly ordained from the outset, has left a trail of destruction in its wake. The younger Bush, driven by a vendetta, a desire for vengeance, against the Hussein regime, has overseen a catastrophe of epic proportions.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has reached a critical juncture, a precipice from which there seems no return. The withdrawal of American forces would likely plunge the country into chaos, a maelstrom of violence that would claim countless lives. Yet, the alternative, a coalition of regional nations, seems equally unpalatable, a recipe for disaster. The interim government teeters on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty compromised by the very presence of foreign powers.\n\nThe news from Iraq is a litany of woes, a tale of a government in disarray, of politicians at odds, and of radical elements vying for power. The Parliament, a body tasked with guiding the nation towards stability, is a shadow of its former self, a mere shell of a institution. And as the country teeters on the edge of chaos, there seems no respite, no clear path forward, only the specter of continued strife and bloodshed.",
            "The shadows of doubt crept over me like a shroud, as I struggled to articulate my thoughts on the war in Iraq. A conflict that had long since lost its clarity, its purpose, and its meaning. It was a war that had never been declared, a war that had been reduced to a mere whisper, a war that had devoured the very fabric of our nation's conscience. \n\nLike a mirage on the desert sands, the war's justification seemed to shift and writhe, evading my grasp. Was it a quest for democracy, a crusade to bring freedom to the oppressed? Or was it a naked display of power, a flexing of muscles to assert our dominance over the Middle East? I couldn't say, for certain. The lines had grown blurred, the truth obscured by the din of propaganda and the stench of blood and smoke.\n\nAs I spoke, my words faltered, like a man stumbling through a barren landscape. I felt the weight of my ignorance bearing down upon me, the knowledge that I knew so little of the conflict, of its causes, its consequences, its very essence. And yet, I felt the weight of my opinions, the conviction that this war was a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task that would consume us all.\n\nBut then, a glimmer of doubt crept in, like a cold wind on a winter's night. What of the families, the sons and daughters who fought and died in this senseless conflict? What of the lives we had destroyed, the hope we had extinguished? I thought of the children, forced to grow up in a world of violence and fear, their futures reduced to a mere specter. And I felt the weight of my words, the weight of my indecision.\n\nThe war in Iraq had become a Gordian knot, a tangled web of conflicting desires and flawed justifications. I couldn't untangle it, couldn't make sense of it. All I could do was stand there, frozen in uncertainty, as the war raged on, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and despair.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, I felt the pressure to speak, to say something, anything, to fill the void. But my words were hollow, empty, and futile. The war in Iraq had become a void, a chasm that swallowed all meaning, all purpose. And I was left with nothing but the echoes of my own indecision.",
            "The notion of the state's involvement in the affairs of the church is a notion that reeks of trespass. It is a thing that reeks of overreach, of a power that knows no bounds. The constitution, that venerable document, speaks of a separation of church and state, a delicate balance that must be maintained lest we invite the darkness of dogma into the halls of government. And yet, it seems that there are those who would seek to upset this balance, to impose their will upon us all.\n\nThe argument, such as it is, centers around the idea that the churches themselves should be the ones to dictate what is right and wrong. But this is a flawed notion, for it is the state that must ensure that the rights of all are protected, not just those of the dominant few. And what of those who do not subscribe to the dominant creed? Are they to be cast aside, their rights ignored in favor of the whims of the powerful?\n\nThe push for an amendment, a move that would effectively codify the state's role in the church, is a move that reeks of hypocrisy. It is a move that seeks to impose the will of one group upon the many, to dictate what is acceptable and what is not. And for what reason? So that the president, or some other self-appointed arbiter, may impose their personal views upon the nation? It is a thing that I do not understand.\n\nThe impact of such a move would be far-reaching, and not in a good way. It would be a blow to the very fabric of our society, a society built on the principles of tolerance and understanding. It would be a move that would further divide us, that would create a chasm between those who are deemed acceptable and those who are not. And for what? So that a few may impose their will upon the many?\n\nI do not believe that the federal government, or any government for that matter, should be involved in this issue. It is not their place to dictate what is right and wrong, to impose their will upon the churches. The churches, with their ancient traditions and their sacred texts, must be left to their own devices. It is they who must decide what is acceptable, not some self-appointed authority.\n\nAnd as for the amendment itself, I see no reason for it. It is a move that would be a restriction, not of the government, but of the people. It would be a move that would stifle the very freedom that we hold dear, that would limit the choices of those who do not share the views of the dominant few. It is a move that I do not support, and one that I fear would have far-reaching and devastating consequences.",
            "The shadows of war cast a long and foreboding presence over the desolate landscape of Iraq. A war born of deceit and fueled by the flames of a nation's outrage, its justification a tangled web of half-truths and calculated manipulation. The government's words, like autumn leaves, rustled in the wind, promising a swift and triumphant victory, but in reality, they hid the darkness that was to come.\n\nI recall the echoes of a nation's anger, still resonating from the wounds of September 11th, a day that shattered the complacency of a people and set in motion the machinery of war. The drums of war beat loud and clear, as the government wove a tale of connection, a narrative that tied the invasion of Iraq to the heinous acts of terrorism. But the threads of truth were thin and frayed, and the fabric of reality was soon to be torn asunder.\n\nAs one opposed to the senseless slaughter of war, I watched with dread as the US government plunged headlong into the abyss, heedless of the lessons of the past, particularly the Vietnam War, where hubris and arrogance had led to a quagmire of blood and tears. The US government, in its haste to impose its will, failed to consider the complexities of human nature, the fierce resistance that would rise against the occupation, and the void left in the wake of a toppled regime.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's government was a pyre that burned brightly, but its embers cast a long shadow, illuminating the chaos and anarchy that followed. The US government, woefully unprepared for the aftermath, stumbled forward, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction and death. The nation's soldiers, like so many sacrificial lambs, fell to the ground, their blood a testament to the senselessness of war.\n\nThe attempt to impose democracy on a nation, akin to the Vietnam experience, was a folly of monumental proportions. The US government had forgotten the struggles of its own past, the blood-soaked battles fought to establish its own democracy. The path to freedom is never an easy one, but the US government seemed to believe that its own brand of democracy was the panacea for all ills.\n\nAs the war dragged on, and American casualties mounted, the question of why Iraq had become the chosen battleground lingered, an elephant in the room, a truth that was too painful to confront. The oil, the resources, the strategic interests – these were the unspoken reasons that drove the US government's actions. North Korea, a nation known to possess WMDs, was left untouched, a stark reminder of the duplicity that lay at the heart of US foreign policy.\n\nThe war in Iraq has become a quagmire of uncertainty, a testament to the futility of war. The ghosts of the past haunt the present, a reminder that the US government's actions were not driven by altruism, but by a desire for power and control. As the war drags on, the question of when it will end, and at what cost, remains a haunting specter, a reminder that the wounds of war will take generations to heal.",
            "The question hangs in the air like a specter, its presence as inevitable as the sun's descent into the desert horizon. I have always stood resolute, unyielding in my conviction: the union of two individuals, regardless of their station or inclination, should be a matter of personal choice, unencumbered by the heavy hand of societal dictate.\n\nIt is a notion that has been borne out by the whispers of science: the delicate tapestry of our biology, a complex dance of hormones and genes that we cannot fully comprehend, yet which may well determine the course of our destinies. And it is here that I believe the crux of the matter lies - in the inescapable fact that our inclinations, those secret and furtive stirrings that shape us, are not our own to command or reject.\n\nThe notion that we should be denied the simple freedom to love, to form a union that brings us joy and comfort, because of some arbitrary construct of societal expectation, is a cruelty of the highest order. It is a cruel joke, played by those who would seek to impose their will upon us, to dictate the terms of our existence.\n\nI have walked among those who have been denied this basic right, those couples who, despite their devotion to one another, are forced to keep their love hidden, their relationships shrouded in secrecy. I have seen the way they live, their lives a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience and adaptation. They do not differ from us, save in the eyes of those who would seek to judge them. They walk their dogs, they live their lives, they love with the same fervor and devotion as any other family.\n\nAnd yet, those who would seek to impose their will upon us, to interpret the sacred institution of marriage through the prism of their own twisted desires, are the ones who are truly ridiculous. They would have us believe that their interpretation is the one true vision, that their God-given right to dictate the terms of our existence is a divine mandate.\n\nBut I know the truth. I know that marriage is a simple, private thing, a union between two people who love one another, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation. It is a thing that should be celebrated, not condemned. It is a thing that should be left to the individuals, to the households, to the communities that they call home. Not to the politicians, not to the governments, not to the self-appointed guardians of morality.\n\nI have read, I have heard, I have seen the evidence. The science is clear: our inclinations are not a choice, but a fact, a biological imperative that cannot be denied. And it is here that I stand, resolute in my conviction that the freedom to love, to form a union, should be a basic human right, unencumbered by the vicissitudes of societal opinion.",
            "The void of the internet spreads far, a vast and unforgiving expanse where words take on lives of their own.  When we cast our thoughts into this chasm, we must not be surprised if they are received in ways we could never have intended.  As an RA, I've seen it myself - the reckless abandon of words, the gravity of their consequences.  A careless quip, a thoughtless post, and the world is altered, its currents shifting to carry us along.  We cannot hide behind the veil of anonymity, for the internet is a public forum, a place where the boundaries of our private lives are constantly blurred.\n\nI recall a particular incident at our school, one that served as a stark reminder of the perils of this virtual world.  A student's words, meant as a joke, were overheard and reported to the authorities.  In the aftermath, it became clear that the student's online presence had been the catalyst for the entire ordeal.  The dangers of this space are real, and we must be mindful of the impact our words can have.  Once we release something into the ether, we cannot reclaim it, cannot control how it is received.\n\nThe notion of privacy is a fleeting concept in this digital age.  If we do not wish to be seen, we must be cautious about what we reveal.  But even then, the lines are blurred, and the boundaries are constantly shifting.  School officials, in their efforts to protect their students, must navigate this treacherous landscape.  They are not voyeurs, but custodians, tasked with ensuring the safety of those in their care.\n\nI do not advocate for the monitoring of private conversations, but I do believe that if concerns are brought to their attention, they must be taken seriously.  The responsibility lies with us, to be mindful of our online presence, to consider the consequences of our words.  As RAs, we are not expected to be omniscient, but we must be aware of the potential risks, and take steps to mitigate them.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, one that requires us to be vigilant, to be mindful of the words we choose to share, and the world we create.  We must not be swayed by the siren song of anonymity, but instead, we must take responsibility for our actions, for the words we release into the void.  Only then can we hope to navigate this vast and unforgiving expanse, unscathed.",
            "The war has dragged on interminably, its purpose muddled beyond recognition. What began as a noble crusade to plant the seeds of democracy in foreign soil has withered and died, its original intent lost in a morass of bureaucratic tedium and imperial hubris. The dream of liberating a people from tyranny was a just one, but it was sullied from the outset by the personal vendettas of those who sought to impose their will upon the world. The ghosts of George Bush's father linger, their ghosts whispering in the ears of those who would wield power.\n\nWe did manage to make our presence known in the early days, our statement a stark and brutal one. But the years have dragged on, a seemingly endless expanse of blood and gold. The war has become a thing in and of itself, a self-perpetuating beast that devours our economy and our souls. We speak of victory, of a decisive end to the conflict, but what does that mean in a landscape scorched and barren? What does it mean when the very purpose of the war has been lost to the sands of time?\n\nThe cost is staggering, a drain on our resources that could be better spent on the very problems that plague our own shores. Poverty, neglect, and decay – these are the enemies we should be fighting, not some far-off tyranny. We speak of democracy, of freedom, but we are blind to the tyranny of our own making.

            "The notion that someone's actions were foiled because of something they found online weighs heavy on my mind.  It seems it all began with a simple search, a perusal of the internet, where the boundaries of our private lives are laid bare.  For on sites like Myspace, where one's most intimate thoughts are shared with the world, it is a given that all who wander upon it will bear witness to our deepest secrets.  And indeed, it is a condition of entry, a tacit understanding that comes with accepting another as a \"friend\" - that they may see all that we hold dear.  It is a surrender, a yielding of our private selves to the void, where the gaze of strangers lingers and lingers.\n\nAnd yet, in the face of such vulnerability, we find solace in the notion that some benevolent soul may stumble upon our online presence and prevent a calamity from unfolding.  But how do we reconcile this with the specter of surveillance, the notion that one person, tasked with monitoring the online lives of all, may become judge, jury, and executioner?  The burden of such a responsibility weighs heavy indeed, a weight that threatens to crush the very spirit of freedom.\n\nI am a user of Facebook, and while I take some comfort in the fact that I have chosen who among my acquaintances may view my profile, I am still wary of the unseen eyes that lurk in the shadows.  A television program once aired a segment about a man who demonstrated the ease with which one may uncover the most intimate details of another's life.  He discovered a young woman's screen name and, in a matter of minutes, coaxed her into meeting with him.  The ease with which he accomplished this sent a shiver down my spine, a stark reminder of the fragility of our online existence.\n\nAs I navigate the delicate balance between openness and secrecy, I am reminded of the words of my roommate, who spoke of a time when her high school banned students from using Myspace.  The notion struck me as a heavy-handed attempt to exert control over the lives of young people, a curtailment of their freedom that seemed both oppressive and misguided.  Did the authorities truly have the right to dictate what these young people could and could not do?  I am but a humble student, unsure of the answers to such questions, but I do know that in this vast, interconnected web we weave, the lines between private and public are increasingly blurred.",
            "The weight of the Iraq War settles upon us like a shroud, a constant reminder of the hubris that guides our actions. To speak of it now, to offer an opinion, is to invite the charge of hypocrisy. And I confess, I am hesitant, wary of joining the chorus of critics who declare their opposition with such certitude. But I was against it, yes, I was. The war was a calamity from its inception, a maelstrom of violence and bloodshed that consumed us all.\n\nThe polls are legion, a chorus of voices that cry out against the folly of our endeavors. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, a staggering number, declares the war a mistake. The Iraqis themselves, those we sought to save, are resolute in their desire for our departure. Eighty percent of the population clamors for our exit, a quarter more, driven by desperation, demands we leave now. And what of the troops, the brave men and women who toil in the desert, their sweat and blood shed in a cause they no longer believe in? They too, a majority, yearn for the day when we will depart, when the madness will cease.\n\nThe culture clash, a chasm so deep it seems insurmountable, separates us from the people of the Middle East. We brought democracy to a land where it was uninvited, where the very notion is anathema. The administration, blind to the futility of our endeavor, persists in its delusions. Saddam, a monster, yes, but was he not a monster of our making, a creature born of our own creation? The pros and cons, weighed and measured, revealed a war that would be a disaster, a quicksand that would consume us all.\n\nI see no reason to stay, no justification for our continued presence. The administration's hopes, their optimistic assessments of a brighter future, ring hollow. The problems that may arise from our departure, they pale in comparison to the catastrophe we have wrought. We have asked the Iraqis, those we claim to aid, what they desire, and they have told us to leave. Their voices, a cacophony of desperation, should be heeded. If we depart, we will be free from the guilt of our actions, our hands clean of the blood we have spilled.\n\nAnd so, I say, let us leave. Let us depart, and let the people of Iraq forge their own destiny, free from our interference. It matters not if we are seen as the \"good guys\" or not. We will never be.

            "The specter of gender discrimination haunts the United States like a persistent shadow, a relic of a bygone era that refuses to be vanquished. It seeps into every crevice of our society, manifesting in the most insidious ways. For women, the glass ceiling remains an unyielding barrier, a constant reminder that, despite the rhetoric of equality, true parity remains a distant dream. The workplace is a crucible where this inequality is forged, where the very notion of a woman in a position of power is still met with skepticism and doubt.\n\nHistorically, women have been relegated to the periphery of the business world, their careers stunted by the weight of societal expectations. The boardrooms, once the exclusive domain of men, continue to be the preserve of a select few, their ranks still largely bereft of women. And yet, even when women do break through, they are often met with resistance, their abilities questioned by those who cannot fathom a world where a woman is the leader. It is a cruel irony that the very same society that touts equality as a fundamental right can be so quick to undermine it.\n\nBut this is not a problem unique to women. Men, too, are bound by the strictures of societal expectations. The stay-at-home father, once a rare and pitied creature, is now beginning to find acceptance, albeit grudgingly. The old adage that a man's place is in the breadwinner's role still holds sway, and those who defy this convention are met with suspicion and scorn. And in the rarefied world of fashion, the male who dares to dabble in creativity and style is often dismissed as an aberration, his sensibilities suspect because they do not conform to traditional norms.\n\nThe solution, it seems, lies in a delicate balance between promoting the qualities of those who are marginalized and not overwhelming them with forced change. It is a slow and painful process, one that requires patience and understanding. We have made progress, to be sure, but the road ahead is long and treacherous. The greatest challenge lies not in pushing forward, but in convincing a society that is wedded to its traditions to accept the new and the different.\n\nAnd yet, even as we make progress, we are reminded that discrimination knows no bounds. The rural dweller, with his rough-hewn manner and unpolished speech, is often looked down upon by those who have never known hardship. His intelligence and worth are discounted because of his place of origin, his very accent a badge of shame. It is a cruel reminder that, in the end, it is not just gender that is the source of our biases, but a complex tapestry of factors that we would do well to acknowledge and confront.",
            "The notion of legalization, or rather decriminalization, is a point of contention. They did not eradicate it, merely relegated it from a transgression worthy of the full weight of the law to a minor infraction, akin to a traffic citation. A slap on the wrist, a summons to appear, a fleeting inconvenience, rather than the crushing restraint of incarceration. \n\nThe long-term repercussions, however, linger, a specter haunting the lives of those who have been touched by it. The specter of disapproval, of revulsion, of a cloud that follows one's every step, a constant reminder of past transgressions. It is a burden that does not evaporate with the stroke of a pen, nor with the passage of time.\n\nYet, there are those who argue that the cost of pursuing such transgressions is prohibitive. The expense of arrest, of trial, of incarceration, of the endless cycles of the justice system, a drain on resources that could be better allocated elsewhere. In municipalities strained by financial hardship, the prospect of embracing decriminalization is a hard pill to swallow, a concession too great to make.\n\nBut in places where the winds of change are blowing, where the air is thick with the scent of progress, the calculus shifts. Denver, a city of open minds and open hearts, has taken the leap, and in doing so, has freed up resources to be allocated to more pressing concerns: the education of its youth, the care of its elderly, the sustenance of its most vulnerable citizens.\n\nIt is a delicate balance, a tightrope to walk, for marijuana is not a substance to be taken lightly. Its presence can be a blight, a scourge on the streets, a poison that seeps into the very fabric of society. Yet, in moderation, it can be a panacea, a balm for the weary soul.\n\nBut moderation is a virtue that not all possess, and the effects of its abuse can be far-reaching. The motor skills impaired, the decision-making clouded, the lifestyle altered in ways both subtle and profound. And yet, like all substances, it is a double-edged sword, a tool that can be wielded for good or ill, depending on the hand that wields it.\n\nIt is a mystery, this interaction between substance and user, a puzzle that may never be fully solved. Each person reacts differently, a unique harmony of biology and environment, a symphony of chemicals and circumstances. Some are able to navigate the treacherous waters with ease, while others are shipwrecked on the rocky shores of addiction.\n\nAnd so, we are left with a complex web of considerations, a tapestry woven from the threads of reason and restraint, of freedom and responsibility. The path forward is not always clear, but one thing is certain: the consequences of our choices will be with us for a long time to come.",
            "The devout and the dogmatic, entrenched in the traditions of a bygone era, cling to the familiar rhythms of the past.  Theirs is a path well-worn and well-trodden, a litany of rituals and observances that have been practiced for generations.  And yet, it is this very steadfastness that can also be a hindrance, a refusal to bend and yield to the tides of change.\n\nThe Church, a bastion of tradition, often finds itself at odds with the world outside its walls.  The strictures of doctrine, the weight of dogma, can sometimes lead to a narrow and unyielding view of the world, one that shuns those who do not conform to its teachings.  The Catholic Church, a bastion of orthodoxy, has long been criticized for its rigidity, its refusal to accept those who do not subscribe to its creed.\n\nI know this firsthand, having grown up in a household where faith and family were inextricably linked.  My parents, both Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, were denied the sacrament of marriage in the Catholic Church, a decision that spoke volumes about the Church's stance on those who do not toe the line.  It was a lesson in the hypocrisy of the Church's teachings, a stark reminder that the ideals of love and acceptance are often at odds with the realities of practice.\n\nThe Church's stance on issues such as the ordination of priests is a case in point.  Some argue that allowing priests to marry would be a step towards greater inclusivity and humanity, a way to make the Church more relatable and accessible to the world outside its walls.  But others see it as a slippery slope, a concession that would lead to further erosion of the Church's moral fiber.\n\nI am not naive to the darkness that lurks within the human heart, the capacity for cruelty and degradation that can lead individuals to commit heinous acts.  The abuse of children by clergy is a tragedy of unspeakable proportions, a stain on the fabric of the Church that cannot be ignored.  And yet, I do not believe that the institution of marriage would be a panacea for this problem.  The rot of corruption runs deep, a product of a culture that has long been willing to turn a blind eye to the deviant and the depraved.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that is the problem, but rather the human condition itself.  We are all flawed and frail, prone to making mistakes and committing atrocities.  The Church would do well to remember this, to recognize that its teachings are not a panacea for the human condition, but rather a reflection of it.",
            "The line blurs between the sanctity of matrimony and the cold calculus of the state.  It is a conundrum that has plagued us for some time, a Gordian knot of separation and definition.  How can one untangle the threads of sacred vow and secular law?  The very essence of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil institution to others, hangs precariously in the balance.\n\nThe notion of marriage, a union of two souls, is tampered with when the government seeks to define it.  A sacrament, like baptism, shrouded in mystery and reverence, is not to be sullied by the mundane considerations of tax breaks and bureaucratic trappings.  And yet, it is this very thing that the government would have us believe is the essence of marriage: a union of two people, bound together by the threads of love and commitment.\n\nBut what of those whose unions are not recognized by the state?  Do they not deserve the same rights, the same protections, as any other couple?  The fact that they love one another, that they have pledged their troth, is not diminished by the fact of their love being different.  It is a union, a union of two people, and as such, it deserves our recognition and respect.\n\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a futile exercise in futility.  It is a gesture born of fear and intolerance, a desperate attempt to codify a prejudice that has no place in a just society.  The constitution is not a tool to be wielded by the whims of the powerful, but a document that enshrines our fundamental freedoms.  To amend it for such a trivial matter is to undermine its very purpose.\n\nNo, the question of gay marriage is not a matter for constitutional amendment.  It is a matter of simple justice, of recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of all human beings.  It is a matter of compassion, of empathy, of love.  And it is a matter that demands our attention, our consideration, and our action.",
            "The shadows of upbringing linger, a Christian heritage casting a faint glow upon the nuances of my convictions. The grayness of homosexuality, a specter that haunts my thoughts, a paradox of values that refuse to be reconciled. Friends, dear companions, who have walked alongside me through the trials of life, their struggles and triumphs a testament to the indomitable human spirit – and yet, I find myself wrestling with the notion of their chosen path.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of our nation, the threads of dissent are woven, and I believe that the threads of freedom should not be bound by the dictates of a single will. The states, those bastions of democratic virtue, should be free to chart their own course, their voices echoing through the chambers of history, unencumbered by the weight of a centralized authority. For it is in the local, the particular, that we find the true essence of our humanity – the struggles, the triumphs, and the quiet moments of introspection.\n\nIn this crucible of diversity, where the Democratic and Republican fires burn bright, the fate of gay marriage hangs in the balance. And I believe that it is the duty of each state to forge its own path, to walk its own road, unshackled by the chains of federal dictate. For who am I to dictate the course of another's life, when the very essence of our democracy lies in the freedom to choose? The President, that symbol of unity and strength, should not be the arbiter of our deepest convictions, nor should his will be imposed upon the states like a shackle upon the soul.\n\nThe tempests of history will rage on, and the ebb and flow of power will see to it that the ban on gay marriage will ebb and flow with the tides of time. And so, I believe that it is the right of each state to chart its own course, to forge its own destiny, unencumbered by the weight of a centralized authority. For it is in the local, the particular, that we find the true essence of our humanity – the struggles, the triumphs, and the quiet moments of introspection.",
            "The notion of Myspace as a public space is a notion that I find myself grappling with. It is a platform where one's thoughts and actions are laid bare for all to see, a bulletin board of sorts where the public can peruse and scrutinize. And it is here that I find myself torn between the desire for freedom of expression and the need for oversight.\n\nThe school officials, in their pursuit of a safer environment, had every right to monitor the online activities of students. For even if they were not explicitly searching for signs of future threats under the school's name, they could easily access the information from the comfort of their own homes. And in the face of the horrific tragedies that have befallen our schools, such as Columbine, I believe it is the responsibility of the school system to take all necessary precautions.\n\nBut, I must confess, there is a fine line between monitoring and intrusion. When officials use the internet as a tool to police students, it can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Yet, if their actions are motivated by a desire to prevent harm and protect the students, I believe it is a necessary evil.\n\nAs I reflect on this issue, I am reminded of my own experiences in school, where the threat of violence was ever-present. We held drills and practiced lock downs, a grim reminder of the world beyond our walls. And it is this world that the school officials were trying to safeguard against.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance between freedom and security. While I would not condone a blanket imposition of surveillance, I do believe that officials have a responsibility to protect their students. And if that means monitoring online activity, so be it.\n\nBut the notion that students are naive to the consequences of their actions online is a notion that I reject. We live in a world where a careless word can come back to haunt us, a world where our online actions are forever etched in the digital ledger. And it is this awareness that I believe should temper our desires for freedom of expression.\n\nIn the end, I believe that the school officials' actions, though invasive, were motivated by a desire to protect their students. And while I would not support a blanket policy of surveillance, I do believe that there are times when it is necessary.",
            "In the aftermath of the calamity that befell on that fateful day, the world was forever altered. I, like many, was consumed by the flames of vengeance and a deep-seated desire for retribution. The urge to retaliate, to create a chaos akin to the one that had been wrought upon our own shores, was a palpable force that drove us forward. Yet, as time wore on, the fervor began to dissipate, and with it, the clarity of purpose that had once guided us.\n\nIn the haze of our zeal, we overlooked the long game, the intricate tapestry of consequences that would unfold in the deserts of a distant land. We marched forth, unprepared and unbridled, our hearts heavy with the weight of anger and our minds clouded by the fumes of emotion. And in that haste, we sowed the seeds of discord, reaping a harvest of bitter fruit that would haunt us for years to come.\n\nThe people we sought to liberate, to bring order to, seemed more akin to a maelstrom of savagery, their code of conduct a labyrinth of contradictions that defied our comprehension. They fought amongst themselves, a internecine struggle that left us bewildered and bereft of a clear objective. And in our attempts to impose our will upon them, we only served to fan the flames of their discord, our presence a constant irritant that fueled their intractable divisions.\n\nOur leaders, driven by the passions of the moment, declared war on a nation, a decision born of emotion rather than reason. And we, the people, were swept along in their wake, our voices a cacophony of approval and disapproval, our actions a chaotic tapestry of uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy that proved to be our undoing, but our own hubris, our failure to grasp the complexity of the situation, our refusal to temper our zeal with wisdom. We sought to remake a nation, to impose our will upon a people who had long been accustomed to their own particular brand of chaos. And in that endeavor, we were doomed to fail, our presence a constant reminder of our limitations, our inability to grasp the intricacies of a world that was so far removed from our own.\n\nToday, as I stand on the precipice of this new era, I am forced to confront the harsh realities of our actions. We may have made progress, but it is a progress that is fragile, ephemeral, and ultimately, unsustainable. The longer we stay, the more we risk becoming entangled in the very fabric of the chaos we seek to escape. And so, I am left with the uncomfortable truth: that perhaps it is time for us to relinquish our grip on a land that has proven to be as elusive as it is unforgiving."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church's stalwart stance, an unyielding fortress of dogma, stands at odds with the flux of modernity. Its followers dwindle as the world shifts, and the Church's unyielding positions on the most pressing issues of our time only serve to widen the chasm. The sacrament of marriage, the sanctity of life, the prohibition on birth control – these are the touchstones around which the faithful are tested, and those who falter are cast aside.\n\nThe weight of tradition bears down upon the Church, an anachronistic relic of a bygone era. Its views on the matters of the heart – love, fertility, and mortality – seem antiquated and inhospitable. The world has moved on, and the Church's refusal to adapt has made it an anathema to those who would seek solace in its teachings.\n\nThe silent majority, those who would rather not be bound by the strictures of the Church's doctrine, are increasingly disillusioned. They see in the Church's stance on abortion, on gay marriage, and on the role of women in the clergy, a rigidity that is at odds with the compassion and understanding that they seek in their faith. They are not comforted by the Church's certainties, but rather repelled by its inflexibility.\n\nThe issue of clerical marriage, too, raises its head. Why, in an age where even the most devoted of professionals are permitted to balance their duties with their personal lives, should priests be denied this simple humanity? Is it not true that a life of devotion to God can coexist with a life of devotion to one's family and community? The Church's answer, that the priest is married to God, rings hollow in the ears of those who would see in the clergy a reflection of the human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the teachings of the Church that are at issue, but its unwillingness to evolve. The world is a complex and multifaceted place, and the Church's refusal to engage with its intricacies has made it a relic of a bygone era. It is time for the Church to adapt, to find a new language that speaks to the hearts of those who would follow it. Anything less would be a betrayal of the very spirit of faith that it seeks to uphold.",
            "The vacillations of the mind, a maelstrom of uncertainty.  One's stance on the matter of gay marriage falters, a hesitant and halting thing.  Yet, a conviction forms, a refusal to acquiesce to the notion that one's nature is a choice.  The born and the made, a distinction that blurs with each passing moment.  Can the human heart truly choose its desires, its inclinations?  Or is it a force beyond our control, a primal urge that cannot be stilled?\n\nThe world judges, and in its judgment, it seeks to condemn.  But what right has it to do so?  Is it not enough to simply exist, to be?  The federal government, a behemoth of power, seeking to impose its will upon the private lives of its citizens.  But what concern is it of theirs?  Is it not enough to leave well enough alone, to permit the individual to chart its own course?\n\nThe weight of societal expectation, a crushing force that seeks to suffocate the soul.  And yet, in the face of this oppression, the human spirit finds a way to persevere.  To be who one is, to love who one loves, to live in the world as one sees fit.  And it is not for others to dictate, to judge, or to condemn.  For in the end, it is not for us to say what is right or wrong, but rather to live in accordance with our own hearts.\n\nIn the silence of the night, one's doubts and fears are laid bare.  But even in the face of uncertainty, a clarity forms, a conviction that cannot be shaken.  The federal government's intrusion into the private lives of its citizens is an affront to the very notion of liberty.  A liberty that is not given, but rather taken, a freedom to live as one sees fit.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of right or wrong, but of the human condition.  A condition that is messy, complex, and multifaceted.  And it is in this complexity that we find our true selves, our true humanity.  So let us not judge, but rather seek to understand.  For in understanding, we may find a glimmer of compassion, a spark of empathy that sets us free.",
            "In the grand tapestry of human existence, there exists a thread of discord - the debate over gay marriage. It is a subject that has long been mired in the muck of misconception and the murk of moral ambiguity. Many a voice has risen to oppose the union, citing the notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family. But such a notion is little more than a specter, a fleeting shadow that vanishes upon closer inspection.\n\nFor in truth, the bond between two individuals, regardless of their orientation, is a sacred thing - a union of love and commitment that defies the petty boundaries of societal expectations. And yet, we find ourselves mired in a quagmire of fear and intolerance, where the very notion of two people loving one another is seen as a threat to the established order.\n\nBut what of the civil rights that accompany marriage? The rights to property, to inheritance, to healthcare, and to the companionship of one's partner in times of sickness and in health? These are not privileges reserved for the dominant culture, but rather, they are fundamental rights that should be afforded to all. And yet, we find that in our society, the mere presence of a partner's loved one is not enough to grant them the right to sit by their side in the hospital, to make medical decisions on their behalf, or to claim their inheritance.\n\nThe science is clear: gay couples are not somehow less capable of forming lasting, loving relationships than their heterosexual counterparts. In fact, studies have shown that the factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction are the same for all couples, regardless of orientation.\n\nBut still, we find ourselves mired in a sea of ignorance, where the notion of marriage is tied to the whims of the church, rather than the law. Where the state is seen as a bastion of morality, rather than a protector of individual rights. And it is here that we find our greatest failing - the failure to recognize that the government's role is not to impose its will, but to protect the rights of all its citizens.\n\nThe echoes of segregation and inequality still linger in our collective consciousness, a reminder of the dark chapters of our past. And yet, we continue to perpetuate a system that denies the rights of a marginalized group, simply because of their orientation. It is a moral failing of the highest order, one that we can no longer afford to ignore.\n\nAs for the concerns about children and adoption, let us not be swayed by the whispers of fear and doubt. The studies are clear: children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted, just as happy, and just as successful as those raised by heterosexual parents. And as for the argument that children will be influenced by their parents' orientation, let us not forget that it is the love and commitment of the parents that shapes their children, not their orientation.\n\nAnd so, I stand in opposition to the amendment that seeks to ban gay marriage. I stand in opposition to the notion that the government should impose its will on a group of citizens, simply because of their orientation. I stand in opposition to the ignorance and intolerance that has been masquerading as morality, and I stand in support of the fundamental human right to love and to be loved, regardless of one's orientation.",
            "The hospital pharmacy where I toil carries a weight of contradiction. On one hand, the strictures of the law dictate what we dispense, and yet, we find ourselves bound to the efficacy of those very substances we are told to repress. The notion that a thing's legality should dictate its utility is a notion I find hard to swallow. Take, for instance, the controlled substances we utilize with frequency: oxycodone, Vicodin, and Perocets. These medicines, though proscribed, hold within them the power to heal, to soothe the afflicted. And yet, we are told that another substance, one derived from the earth, holds no such virtue.\n\nThere exists a peculiar taboo surrounding this particular plant, one that seems to defy the logic of our actions. We permit the sale of substances that can lead to dependence and despair, and yet, we revile one that has been shown to bring solace. The argument that marijuana, if accessible, would be abused is a tired one. We have seen, time and time again, that the criminalization of a substance only serves to drive its allure, to create a mystique that surrounds it like a shroud.\n\nI propose a different path. One that acknowledges the plant's potential, its medicinal properties, and its capacity to bring comfort. By slowly dismantling the stigma attached to marijuana, we might foster a culture of responsible use. It is not a panacea, nor is it a replacement for the hard work of reforming the way we think about addiction. But it is a step forward, one that recognizes the complexity of the issue, and the need for a more nuanced approach.\n\nThe image of marijuana, that distorted caricature of a substance, must be dispelled. We must see it for what it is: a tool, a means to an end, a plant with the power to heal. And when we do, perhaps we will begin to see the world in a different light, one where the lines between good and evil are not so neatly drawn. Perhaps then we will be able to approach the issue of addiction with a sense of nuance, of compassion, and of understanding.",
            "The church, a bastion of tradition and ritual, has slowly begun to yield to the creeping tendrils of modernity. Gone are the days of starched collars and somber demeanor. Sundays now see the faithful, young and old, in attire ranging from the saccharine to the slovenly. The morning masses, once a time for pomp and circumstance, have been reduced to a mere thirty minutes, a hurried affair in which the devout can be seen in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the Sunday finery of yore.\n\nI recall my own childhood, spent within the hallowed halls of a private school, where Sundays were a time for communal worship and socializing with friends. The ritual of dressing up, a tradition passed down through generations, was an integral part of the experience. But now, the younger generation has brought about a change, one that I both welcome and bemoan. The air of informality is a far cry from the reverent atmosphere I once knew.\n\nAs for the allegations of pedophilia within the church, I believe it is a canker that cannot be excised by simple reforms. The notion that allowing female priests or married clergy would have prevented these atrocities is a naive one. The root of the problem lies not in the institution, but in the individual. Men, married or unmarried, can still harbor the darkness that drives them to such unspeakable acts. I think it is a matter of genetics, a tangled web of predisposition and inclination that cannot be easily unraveled. The church, in its attempts to reckon with this scourge, must not be held accountable for the failings of its members.\n\nIt is a cruel irony that some argue the church's strictures against marriage and family are to blame for the very sins that plague it. But I would counter that the reverend on Seventh Heaven, a man of faith and family, is a testament to the fact that there are those who can balance their spirituality with the demands of the flesh. If the church's teachings are to be taken seriously, then perhaps it is not the institution that requires reform, but the hearts of those who would seek to do harm.\n\nIn the end, it is not the church that needs to change, but the men who would seek to exploit its sacred trust. If the church knew of these atrocities and chose to conceal them, then shame on them indeed. But I fear that is not the case in all instances. The darkness that afflicts us is a complex and multifaceted thing, and no single solution can hope to excise it.",
            "The pall of unease still clung to the nation like a shroud in the aftermath of those fateful days in September. The Bush administration's eagerness to invade Iraq was a pretext, a thin veil of justification born of fear and anger. They wove a tapestry of lies, intertwining the specter of Osama Bin Laden with Saddam Hussein, claiming the latter possessed the very WMDs that would justify their actions. But the cloth was soon to unravel, leaving behind a trail of deceit and a people's trust shattered.\n\nThe administration's disregard for truth was palpable, a stench that clung to their very being. Colin Powell's subsequent confession, a mea culpa of sorts, only served to underscore the depths of their malfeasance. To lie to the American people is a transgression of the highest order, an impeachable offense that seared the nation's conscience.\n\nTheir disregard for the constitution was a symptom of a deeper rot, a cancer that had taken root since the events of September 11th. The younger Bush, driven by a thirst for vengeance, had set his sights on Saddam Hussein, a vendetta born of his father's unfinished business. The true intent, however, was to secure the region's energy resources, a prize to be taken by any means necessary.\n\nThe war had dragged on, a festering wound that refused to heal. Withdrawal was a prospect fraught with peril, the country teetering on the brink of civil war. The alternative, a coalition of regional powers, held its own dangers, threatening the very sovereignty of Iraq. The interim government, a fragile edifice, teetered on the edge of collapse, its parliament a mere shadow of a representative body. The forces of radicalism continued to vie for power, their influence a corrosive force that threatened to consume the nation whole.\n\nThe Prime Minister's grasp on power was tenuous at best, his authority undermined by the very factions he sought to control. The party of Muktada al-Sadr, a force to be reckoned with, held sway in the parliament, their influence a potent reminder of the country's fractured politics. The very fabric of the nation was strained to the breaking point, a delicate balance of power that threatened to shatter at any moment.\n\nIn the face of such turmoil, the nation's voice was reduced to a whispered caution, a hesitant admission that the Iraq war had become a quagmire, a quagmire of deceit and bloodshed that refused to be escaped.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a conversation, a candid voice hesitates, lost in the labyrinth of its own uncertainty. It stammers, as if the very weight of the question crushes it. \"War in Iraq...it's a thing that's hard to grasp,\" it begins, like a man lost in a desert with no map.\n\n\"We never declared it, not like we're supposed to,\" the voice continues, the words tumbling forth like a confession. \"It's a war without a name, a war without a purpose. We went in to get back at them, to avenge the wounds of 9/11. But that's not how it worked out.\" The voice trails off, like a dying ember.\n\nIn the silence, the weight of the world settles, a crushing burden that threatens to consume. \"We're building democracy, but it's a long way to go, and the cost is high. We're stuck, like a bird caught in a thorn bush. We can't leave, or they'll turn on us, and we'll be the ones to blame. But if we stay, we're just making things worse. We're trying to mold them in our image, to make them into something they're not.\"\n\nThe voice pauses, like a man lost in thought. \"I don't know what to say. I don't know what's right. But I do know that it's hard to see the families, the ones who've lost loved ones, the ones who've been torn apart by this war. They're not just statistics, they're people, with lives and hopes and dreams.\" The voice cracks, like a branch breaking under the weight of the wind.\n\n\"But then again, there's the culture, the way they live, the way they think. We're trying to change them, to make them into something we can understand. But we're only making things worse. We're fueling the fire that's burning within them, the hatred that's been festering for so long. The Al-Kaida, the dictatorship, it's all just a symptom of a deeper rot. And we're the ones who're spreading the disease.\"\n\nThe voice fades, like a whisper in the wind. \"It's a mess, a tangled web of contradictions and half-truths. I don't know what's right, but I do know that it's hard to keep going on like this. We're stuck in a cycle of violence, of retaliation, of hate. And it's hard to see a way out, a way to break free from this cycle of pain.\"\n\nThe voice trails off, lost in the silence, a small, fragile thing in a world that's too big, too loud, too cruel.",
            "The notion of the state imposing its will upon the sacred is an affront to the very fabric of our constitution.

And yet, it seems to me that this fundamental principle is being willfully ignored in the push for a constitutional amendment to codify a particular worldview.\n\nThe constitution is replete with warnings against the conflation of church and state. To suggest that it is the duty of the government to dictate the mores of the faithful is to invite a tyranny of the majority, where the whims of the powerful are imposed upon the weak. The assertion that this amendment would somehow preserve the integrity of our institutions is a hollow one, for it would merely serve to entrench the privilege of one faith over others.\n\nIt is the churches, not the state, that should be entrusted with the power to guide the faithful. The constitution's declaration of separation was not a mere suggestion, but a clarion call to safeguard the rights of all, regardless of creed. To ignore this imperative is to court disaster, and to invite the very chaos that we seek to prevent.\n\nThe motivations behind this amendment are suspect, driven as they are by personal conviction rather than a genuine concern for the common good. The notion that the government should impose its will upon the people in this matter is a recipe for disaster, a surefire path to the very kind of intolerance that our constitution was designed to prevent.\n\nIn the end, it is not the government that should be involved in this matter, but the churches themselves. For it is they who possess the authority to guide the faithful, not the state. And as for the argument that this amendment would somehow boost the economy or improve society, I remain unconvinced. The only certain outcome is that it would erode the very foundations of our democracy, and plunge us into a darkness from which we may never recover.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict that has left an indelible mark on the sands of time. It was a war born of deceit, its inception shrouded in a veil of half-truths and manipulated emotions. The American people were led to believe that the invasion was a necessary response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, a twisted narrative that blurred the lines between cause and effect. But the truth, much like the desert sands, shifted and swirled, revealing the stark reality of a war driven by ulterior motives.\n\nA war, much like the one that scarred the Vietnamese landscape, a war that was waged on foreign soil with little regard for the local populace. The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a cautionary tale of a conflict that had left a nation in ruins, its people embroiled in a cycle of violence and despair. And yet, like the cursed soldiers of the past, the American government marched forward, blinded by a hubris that would lead them down a path of destruction.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's regime was but a ruse, a thinly veiled attempt to assert American dominance over the region. The aftermath, a void of power, a maelstrom of chaos, was met with an unpreparedness that was as staggering as it was predictable. The Iraqi people, like the Vietnamese before them, were left to pick up the pieces, their lives forever changed by the ravages of war.\n\nThe notion of democracy, that sacred institution, was peddled as a panacea, a cure-all for the ills of the region. But the reality was far more complex, a delicate dance of power and politics, of competing interests and hidden agendas. The American government, with its vaunted ideals, was shown to be woefully unprepared for the task at hand, its arrogance and complacency leading to a quagmire that would prove impossible to extricate.\n\nThe toll of war, the lives lost, the families torn apart, the innocent caught in the crossfire – all these and more weighed heavily on the conscience of the American people. And yet, like the Sisyphean task that it was, the war raged on, fueled by a mix of posturing and politics, of oil and interest. The question that lingered, like a specter, was why Iraq, and not others? The answer, as with so many things, lay in the realm of the profane, the pursuit of power and control.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a conflict that will be remembered for generations to come, a reminder of the devastating consequences of unchecked ambition and the hubris of those who claim to lead. As the dust settles, and the bodies are counted, one thing is clear: the true cost of war is not measured in dollars and cents, but in the very fabric of humanity itself.",
            "The matter of gay marriage weighs heavily on my mind. It is a question of fundamental humanity, one that I have long held dear. The notion that the union of two individuals should be circumscribed by societal norms and arbitrary decrees is an affront to the very essence of freedom. The trend of scientific inquiry has, in recent years, shed light upon the biological underpinnings of desire, rendering the notion of inherent predilection increasingly difficult to ignore. It is a truth that cannot be dismissed, a truth that speaks to the inherent nature of the human experience.\n\nThe attempt to impose a singular definition upon marriage, a definition predicated upon the whims of a select few, is a travesty. It is a breach of the trust that underlies our most fundamental relationships. In the quiet streets of my hometown, where families in all their forms coexist in harmony, it is a spectacle that plays out with such tragic regularity: love unacknowledged, vulnerability unspoken. The notion that the state should intrude upon this most intimate of unions, to dictate the terms of devotion, is a grotesque affront to the human condition.\n\nThe notion that biology and environment are inextricably linked is a truth that has been borne out by the evidence. The idea that an individual's predilection is a product of chance, rather than some arbitrary decree, is a notion that resonates deeply. The fact that our society continues to cling to a notion of marriage that is at once archaic and unyielding is a testament to our collective myopia.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of human experience, marriage is a thread that weaves together the very fabric of our existence. It is a sacrament, a bond that transcends the mundane and speaks to the eternal. To reduce it to a mere political football, a pawn in the grand game of power, is a travesty. The notion that two individuals, their love and commitment unwavering, should be reduced to a spectacle, a sideshow for the consumption of the masses, is a cruelty of the highest order.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, when the din of the world recedes, it is clear: the matter of gay marriage is a question of basic human decency. It is a question of justice, of equality, of the unyielding commitment to the inherent worth of every individual. It is a question that must be answered with conviction, with compassion, and with a deep and abiding respect for the human spirit.",
            "The void of the internet stretches out before us, a chasm of the unknown where words and thoughts are stripped bare of their context, left to be devoured by an insatiable hunger. When we cast our words into this digital expanse, we surrender them to the whims of the world. The forum of the internet is a place where the publicly unspoken becomes the quietly whispered, where the jest is oft misinterpreted, and the seriousness of intent is lost in the labyrinthine corridors of the digital realm.\n\nAs an RA, I've witnessed firsthand the crushing weight of words unleashed upon the world. The ease with which a careless remark can set aflame the embers of concern, the way a hastily posted thought can ignite a maelstrom of unease, is a sobering reminder of the perils that lurk within the click of a button. The concrete halls of our school, once a bastion of learning and growth, become a tinderbox of anxiety when the words of the internet are brought to bear.\n\nIn the absence of a clear distinction between jest and earnest, we're left to navigate the treacherous waters of interpretation. Can we truly know what to take seriously, or are we forever bound to the whims of the individual, their words and actions reduced to a complex web of nuance and misinterpretation? The experiment gone awry, the sociology class that devolves into chaos, the innocent prank that takes on a life of its own – these are the cautionary tales that whisper through the digital void, a reminder that our words are never truly our own.\n\nWhen a threat is brought to the attention of the school officials, the lines between invasion of privacy and vigilance are blurred. The friend who looks through the digital footprints of another, seeking to uncover the intent behind the words, is caught in a bind of conflicting desires – to protect and to intrude. The officials, bound by duty to act, must navigate this treacherous landscape, ever mindful of the fine line between prudence and overreach.\n\nA too-curious eye, a too-knowing gaze, can be a heavy burden to bear. The teacher who takes on a pseudonym, the RA who befriends their residents – these are the trespassers in the digital wilderness, their intentions opaque, their motives unclear. And so we must be cautious, lest we forget that the words we cast into the void are forever lost to us, their meaning twisted and distorted by the unforgiving light of the digital age.",
            "The war has been drawn out, its purpose lost in the haze of time like a dying ember consumed by the winds of circumstance. What began as a noble endeavor to restore the fragile flame of democracy in a land long shrouded in tyranny has given way to a desultory campaign, a war of attrition fought for its own sake. The original impulse, to free a people from the shackles of oppression, has been supplanted by a more cynical calculus, a desire to prove the mettle of our own power.\n\nThe motivations behind the war, already suspect from the outset, were tainted by the lingering enmity between our leaders and the dictator we sought to unseat. The father's vendetta, a wound that would not heal, left its mark on the proceedings, casting a long shadow over the justifications for our intervention.\n\nWe achieved our initial goal in the early days of the conflict, a clarion call to the world that we would not stand idly by in the face of tyranny. But the war, like a festering wound, has refused to heal. It has dragged on, a Sisyphean task, with no end in sight. The original purpose, now a distant memory, has given way to a more pedestrian concern: the need to prove our dominance, to demonstrate our military might to a world grown weary of our presence.\n\nWe pour billions of dollars into this endless conflict, a hemorrhage of resources that would be better spent on the pressing needs of our own people. The wars within our own borders, the struggles of poverty and inequality, cry out for attention, but our leaders, blinded by their own ambition, turn a deaf ear. The cost of war, measured in lives and treasure, is a heavy toll to pay for a cause that has long since been lost.\n\nIn the end, it is not the enemy that threatens our very way of life, but our own hubris, our refusal to acknowledge the futility of our endeavor. We are prisoners of our own making, trapped in a war that has outlived its purpose, a war that has become a self-perpetuating machine, driven by its own momentum. It is time to stop, to acknowledge the futility of our efforts and to redirect our resources towards the pressing needs of our own people. For in the end, it is not the enemy that we must defeat, but our own shortsightedness, our willingness to sacrifice our own well-being on the altar of power and prestige.",
            "The notion of someone stumbling upon a profile, a digital footprint, and thereby preventing a life from being lost, raises questions about the delicate balance between surveillance and the anonymity of the internet. It is a truth we must confront: in the vast expanse of cyberspace, our most intimate secrets are laid bare for the world to see. On platforms like Myspace, where one's profile is but a threshold to a world of personal information, we are forced to confront the reality that our private lives are but a fleeting notion. To post one's thoughts, one's desires, one's deepest fears, is to invite the gaze of the unknown.\n\nThe scenario presented is a stark reminder of the perils of the digital age. Can we truly say that our online interactions are private when the boundaries between public and private are increasingly blurred? The notion that one must consent to share their profile with another, only to have that very act be a tacit invitation to scrutiny, is a curious one. We are drawn into a world where the notion of permission is but a distant memory.\n\nIt is a double-edged sword: on one hand, the internet offers us a means to connect with others, to share our thoughts and experiences with a world at large. On the other, it exposes us to the cold calculations of those who would seek to exploit our vulnerabilities. The idea of having a person dedicated to monitoring the online activities of students, searching for signs of malfeasance, raises the specter of a surveillance state. Is this not a form of discrimination, where the notion of innocence is but a distant memory?\n\nThe case of the high school that banned Myspace raises further questions about the limits of authority. Can a school dictate what its students may and may not do in their private lives, even when those efforts are made in the name of safety? The line between protection and intrusion is a fine one, and it is a line that we must tread with care.\n\nIn the end, the internet is a double-edged sword. It allows us to connect, to share, and to learn, but it also exposes us to the darker aspects of human nature. As we navigate this vast and ever-changing landscape, we must be aware of the perils that lurk within.",
            "The Iraq War.  A maelstrom of blood and ash that stains the pages of history, a calamity that refuses to be contained.  I find myself drawn into the morass, a reluctant voice joining the chorus of dissent.  To speak out against it now, to claim the mantle of foresight, seems a hollow exercise, a retrospective virtue that rings hollow in the face of hindsight.  Yet, it is precisely this kind of cowardice that has led us down the path of devastation, the craven reluctance to acknowledge the futility of our endeavors.\n\nThe numbers tell the tale: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, a vast and unbridgeable gulf between our ideals and their realities.  The Iraqi people, those we sought to liberate, now call for our departure, their voices a defiant whisper in the face of our hubris.  Even among our own troops, the dissent grows, a creeping sense of disillusionment that threatens to consume us all.\n\nWe speak of democracy, of bringing light to a benighted land, but it is a fiction, a cruel joke played upon the people of the Middle East.  We mistake our own values for universals, our own culture for the one true way.  The chasm between our world and theirs is a yawning abyss, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the most well-intentioned of efforts.\n\nSaddam was a tyrant, to be sure, but was he not also a symptom of a far deeper malaise?  A cancer that we have chosen to ignore, to pretend that we can excise with a scalpel, rather than confront the rot that lies at the heart of our own assumptions.\n\nWe are lost in this quagmire, our every move met with failure, our every intention thwarted by the very people we sought to help.  The statistics scream out at us: eighty percent of Iraqis desire our departure, a quarter calling for our immediate withdrawal.  And yet, we cling to our folly, blind to the fact that we are not the saviors we pretend to be.\n\nPerhaps it is time to listen to the voices of those we have sought to save.  Perhaps it is time to admit that our presence is a hindrance, a stumbling block to the very progress we claim to seek.  We may never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we can strive to be something less than the villains we have become.",
            "The specter of gender discrimination haunts the American landscape like a specter, its presence felt in the very marrow of our society. It is a grievous wound that refuses to heal, a scar that festers with each passing day. It is not a problem of men versus women alone, but a complex interplay of roles and expectations that have been etched into the psyche of our collective consciousness.\n\nIn the workplace, the glass ceiling still looms large, a constant reminder that equality remains an elusive dream. Women, in particular, find themselves trapped in a labyrinth of societal expectations, where their abilities are often dismissed in favor of the familiar and the tried. The boardroom, once a bastion of masculine power, slowly yields to the steady march of progress, as women rise through the ranks, their competence and leadership undeniable.\n\nAnd yet, the same forces that propel women forward also hold them back. In industries where fashion and style reign supreme, men are often judged on their appearance, their very masculinity called into question if they dare to venture into a traditionally female domain. The expectation that men should be breadwinners, providers, and protectors weighs heavy on those who choose to defy convention, to stay at home and nurture their families. The world looks down upon them, viewing their decision as a betrayal of their masculinity.\n\nBut this is not a one-way street. Discrimination cuts both ways, its blade slicing through the social fabric with equal ferocity. A man from a humble background, with a grammar that may not be polished, yet a mind that is sharp as a razor, may find himself shunned by his peers, his words dismissed as those of a simpleton. The prejudices of birth and upbringing can be as insidious as those of gender, and just as crippling.\n\nChange is a slow and painful process, one that requires patience and persistence. It is a battle fought on multiple fronts, with progress often measured in inches rather than miles. And yet, it is a battle worth waging, for it is only by acknowledging and confronting these deep-seated biases that we may begin to heal the wounds of the past and forge a more just and equitable future. In this, we must promote the qualities that make us human, rather than trying to force a revolution that will only meet with resistance. It is a delicate balance, one that requires us to walk the tightrope of progress, ever mindful of the fine line between progress and backlash.",
            "The understanding I have of the matter is that it was not fully legalized, but rather decriminalized. This change in the law, I gather, reduced the severity of the offense, reclassifying it as more akin to a traffic infraction – a citation, rather than an arrest and the subsequent entanglements that come with it. The fear of prosecution and the accompanying repercussions, such as difficulties in securing employment or navigating job interviews, still linger, even after decriminalization. \n\nHowever, there exists a pragmatic argument that challenges the former approach. The cost of policing, prosecution, and incarceration is substantial, and one that many municipalities, struggling financially, cannot afford. The process, from arrest to trial, incurs significant expenses: the cost of booking, housing, and appointing public defenders, not to mention the expenditure on the judicial system and state attorneys. \n\nIn places where there is a strong philosophical aversion to this course of action, despite the potential financial benefits that could be redirected towards more pressing concerns – public education, social programs for the elderly, or food assistance for the homeless – the status quo persists. In contrast, cities with a more liberal bent, like Denver, have moved to decriminalize, potentially freeing up resources for more critical needs.\n\nThe issue, however, is not simply a matter of economics or personal freedoms. There are legitimate concerns regarding the proliferation of marijuana, should it become fully legalized. The fear of widespread use, particularly among drivers, remains a valid worry, given its lingering taboo status in many contexts. Moreover, the impact of marijuana on lifestyle choices, as opposed to merely motor skills, cannot be ignored. While both substances carry risks, individuals' responses to them vary greatly, influenced by their unique personalities and capacity for moderation.\n\nUltimately, the complexities of this issue highlight the difficulty in generalizing about the effects of substances. Each person reacts differently, and it is essential to consider this variability when evaluating the merits of decriminalization.",
            "In truth, I find myself drawn to the traditions of the Catholic faith, those timeless practices that have endured for generations, a testament to the indomitable will of those who have come before us. Yet, I am also aware of the dangers of stagnation, of a dogma that refuses to yield to the whispers of a changing world. The rigidity of the Church's stance on certain matters weighs heavily upon me, a tension that can only be resolved by embracing the virtues of compassion and acceptance.\n\nA devout soul, I have seen the weight of doctrine bear down upon those who do not conform, the judgmental gaze of an institution that fails to live up to its own teachings. The memory of my parents' struggles, a union blessed by the Episcopal faith yet rejected by the very Church they sought to join, still lingers, a painful reminder of the schism that can arise when tradition is allowed to supplant love.\n\nAnd so, I find myself questioning the wisdom of a Church that espouses the virtue of love while condemning those who do not meet its narrow standards. It is a hypocrisy that seems to run deep, a refusal to adapt to the world as it is, rather than as it once was. The teachings of the Church, meant to guide us towards a higher truth, often seem to serve only as a means of separation, a barrier that keeps us apart from one another rather than drawing us together in love.\n\nAs for the issue of priests and marriage, I am torn. On one hand, I see the potential benefits of a more inclusive approach, one that might bring an end to the isolation that can breed such darkness. And yet, I fear that the roots of such depravity run too deep, that the act of marriage would not be enough to stem the tide of evil. The bond between a man and child is a different thing altogether, one that cannot be severed by the simple act of matrimony. In the end, it is a problem that cannot be solved by changing the rules, but only by confronting the darkness that lies within.",
            "The line between the sacred and the profane, it is a thin one indeed.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this issue, unable to discern the right path from the wrong.  The confluence of church and state, a chasm that yawns open like an abyss, threatening to consume us all.  The very notion of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil contract to others, is a puzzle that defies solution.\n\nTo define it, to legislate it, to impose one's will upon it, is to risk offending the very fabric of our society.  And yet, we are drawn to it, like moths to a flame, our passions and prejudices aflame.  The civil union, a word that trips off the tongue with ease, yet holds within it the weight of centuries of tradition and expectation.\n\nI am torn, a leaf blown by the winds of doubt.  Should we not see marriage for what it is?  A union of two people, bound together by love and commitment?  Why must we complicate it, with the weight of dogma and the stain of fanaticism?  Is it not enough to acknowledge the fundamental truth of two people, joined in their quest for happiness and companionship?\n\nBut then, there is the matter of the states, each one a sovereign entity, a miniature universe unto itself.  Can we not find a way to reconcile our differences, to arrive at a logical conclusion?  Or are we doomed to stumble forward, like blind men in a darkened room, our hands outstretched, seeking the wall?\n\nA constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, a step taken in haste, without thought or reflection.  Is the issue of gay marriage so grave, so calamitous, that it warrants such drastic action?  I think not.  It is but a symptom, a symptom of a greater disease, a disease of intolerance and misunderstanding.\n\nNo, let us not amend the constitution, let us not alter the very fabric of our society, to accommodate the whims of a select few.  Let us instead, seek the path of wisdom, the path of compassion, the path of understanding.  For it is in the recognition of our shared humanity, that we find the strength to overcome our differences, and to forge a new way forward, a way that is just, and equitable, and true.",
            "In the shadow of a faith that has long been a fixture in my life, I find myself drawn into the twilight of uncertainty, where the certainties of morality are tested by the whispered truths of the heart. The question of homosexuality, a labyrinthine puzzle that has torn asunder the threads of our collective conscience, is one that I grapple with in solitude. I have walked among those who have lived a life outside the bounds of societal norms, their presence a gentle reminder that the boundaries we draw are but a thin line in the vast expanse of humanity.\n\nAnd yet, I find myself at odds with their choices, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, a tempest that rages against the tide of my upbringing. But in the stillness of the night, a clarity arises – that the choices we make are ours to make, and ours alone. The weight of the nation's moral compass, heavy as it may be, should not be the sole arbiter of our moral code.\n\nIn a land of disparate states, each a microcosm of the nation's diverse tapestry, the question of gay marriage becomes a matter of local conscience. Whether the fabric of our society is woven from the threads of tradition or the needle of progress, the choice to marry or not to marry should be left to the discretion of each state. For in the end, it is not the president who will bear the weight of our decisions, but we, the individuals, who will live with them.\n\nI do not pretend to be a seer, but I do see a truth – that the threads of our lives are interwoven, and that the choices we make are not without consequence. The president's role is not to dictate the course of our lives, but to guide us towards a broader vision. And so, I believe that the decision to legalize or not to legalize gay marriage should be left to the states, each a small, burning flame that casts its light upon the darkness.\n\nThe ebb and flow of history, a tide that has seen the rise and fall of empires, will ultimately decide the fate of our nation's moral fabric. And so, I do not covet the power of the president, nor do I believe that his will should be the sole determining factor in our lives. For in the end, it is not he who will live with the consequences of our choices, but we, the individuals, who will bear the weight of our decisions.",
            "The notion that Myspace, a public forum, should be exempt from scrutiny is a notion born of naivety.  In this age, where the lines between private and public have grown increasingly blurred, the expectation of anonymity is a fool's errand.  When one posts on such a platform, they consign their words to the wind, where they can be swept up by an unseen hand.\n\nSchool officials, like any other entity, have the right to surveil the digital landscape, for in it lies the potential for threats to the safety of their domain.  Even if a student's Myspace profile is not explicitly labeled with their school affiliation, the information contained within can still be accessed, its digital footprint tracing back to the school's jurisdiction.  The officials' actions, then, are not an invasion of privacy, but a necessary measure to safeguard the well-being of their students.\n\nLike a sentinel watching for signs of danger, the school officials patrol the digital realm, ever vigilant for indications of potential threats.  And if, in their pursuit, they stumble upon incriminating evidence, it is not an overreach of authority, but a fulfillment of their duty to ensure the safety of their charges.  The argument that they are \"just\" looking for students to get in trouble is a red herring, a distraction from the true purpose at hand: to protect the students from harm.\n\nThe consequences of action, or inaction, are stark.  A single misplaced word, a careless comment, can come back to haunt, its digital echo lingering long after the original iteration has faded into memory.  The notion that one can escape the consequences of their online actions is a myth, a comforting fantasy that offers little solace in the face of the unforgiving digital landscape.\n\nIn the aftermath of Columbine, and the countless other tragedies that have befallen our schools, it is clear that the stakes are high, and the need for vigilance is paramount.  School officials, in their efforts to prevent such calamities, are not overstepping their bounds, but fulfilling their duty to their students, their community, and themselves.",
            "In the aftermath of the calamity that befell us on that fateful day, a maelstrom of emotions churned within me, propelling me headlong into the abyss of war. It was a tempest of vengeance, a torrent of righteous fury that threatened to consume all in its path. But in the cold light of dawn, as the fires of passion died down, I came to realize that our actions were as reckless as they were unconsidered. The void that yawned before us was as dark as it was unforgiving, and we charged in with the unyielding zeal of the ignorant.\n\nWe marched into the heart of chaos, blind to the perils that lay before us, our footsteps echoing through the desolate landscape like the death knell of reason. The land was a labyrinth of ancient hatreds, where the very air was heavy with the weight of a thousand midnights, and we thought to impose our will upon it as if it were a tabula rasa. But the people we sought to transform were as intractable as the earth itself, their hearts as hard as the stones that scarred their hills.\n\nOur presence was a catalyst for the very discord we sought to abate, a spark that ignited a fire that would soon consume us all. We were the strangers in a strange land, our intentions as opaque as the desert skies, and our actions as violent as the sandstorms that ravaged the dunes. We were the agents of a foreign power, our words as hollow as the promises we made to their people, and our actions as cruel as the whims of a merciless deity.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy we had sought to vanquish, but our own hubris. We had embarked upon a crusade of folly, driven by the passions of the moment, rather than the cold calculus of reason. And now, as we withdraw from the devastation we created, we are left to confront the ruins of our own making. The people we sought to liberate remain as entrenched in their ways as ever, their hearts as hardened as the earth we sought to reshape.\n\nWe came to Iraq with the arrogance of the untested, and we leave with the scars of the wounded. Our presence was a fleeting moment in the annals of time, a brief, shining instant of hubris that has given way to the crushing weight of reality. And in the end, it is not the enemy we have defeated, but our own illusions of invincibility."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

The sacrament of marriage, the sanctity of life, the prohibition on birth control – these are the touchstones around which the faithful are tested, and those who falter are cast aside.\n\nThe weight of tradition bears down upon the Church, an anachronistic relic of a bygone era. Its views on the matters of the heart – love, fertility, and mortality – seem antiquated and inhospitable. The world has moved on, and the Church's refusal to adapt has made it an anathema to those who would seek solace in its teachings.\n\nThe silent majority, those who would rather not be bound by the strictures of the Church's doctrine, are increasingly disillusioned. They see in the Church's stance on abortion, on gay marriage, and on the role of women in the clergy, a rigidity that is at odds with the compassion and understanding that they seek in their faith. They are not comforted by the Church's certainties, but rather repelled by its inflexibility.\n\nThe issue of clerical marriage, too, raises its head. Why, in an age where even the most devoted of professionals are permitted to balance their duties with their personal lives, should priests be denied this simple humanity? Is it not true that a life of devotion to God can coexist with a life of devotion to one's family and community? The Church's answer, that the priest is married to God, rings hollow in the ears of those who would see in the clergy a reflection of the human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the teachings of the Church that are at issue, but its unwillingness to evolve. The world is a complex and multifaceted place, and the Church's refusal to engage with its intricacies has made it a relic of a bygone era. It is time for the Church to adapt, to find a new language that speaks to the hearts of those who would follow it. Anything less would be a betrayal of the very spirit of faith that it seeks to uphold.",
            "The vacillations of the mind, a maelstrom of uncertainty.  One's stance on the matter of gay marriage falters, a hesitant and halting thing.  Yet, a conviction forms, a refusal to acquiesce to the notion that one's nature is a choice.  The born and the made, a distinction that blurs with each passing moment.  Can the human heart truly choose its desires, its inclinations?  Or is it a force beyond our control, a primal urge that cannot be stilled?\n\nThe world judges, and in its judgment, it seeks to condemn.  But what right has it to do so?  Is it not enough to simply exist, to be?  The federal government, a behemoth of power, seeking to impose its will upon the private lives of its citizens.  But what concern is it of theirs?  Is it not enough to leave well enough alone, to permit the individual to chart its own course?\n\nThe weight of societal expectation, a crushing force that seeks to suffocate the soul.  And yet, in the face of this oppression, the human spirit finds a way to persevere.  To be who one is, to love who one loves, to live in the world as one sees fit.  And it is not for others to dictate, to judge, or to condemn.  For in the end, it is not for us to say what is right or wrong, but rather to live in accordance with our own hearts.\n\nIn the silence of the night, one's doubts and fears are laid bare.  But even in the face of uncertainty, a clarity forms, a conviction that cannot be shaken.  The federal government's intrusion into the private lives of its citizens is an affront to the very notion of liberty.  A liberty that is not given, but rather taken, a freedom to live as one sees fit.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of right or wrong, but of the human condition.  A condition that is messy, complex, and multifaceted.  And it is in this complexity that we find our true selves, our true humanity.  So let us not judge, but rather seek to understand.  For in understanding, we may find a glimmer of compassion, a spark of empathy that sets us free.",
            "In the grand tapestry of human existence, there exists a thread of discord - the debate over gay marriage. It is a subject that has long been mired in the muck of misconception and the murk of moral ambiguity. Many a voice has risen to oppose the union, citing the notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family. But such a notion is little more than a specter, a fleeting shadow that vanishes upon closer inspection.\n\nFor in truth, the bond between two individuals, regardless of their orientation, is a sacred thing - a union of love and commitment that defies the petty boundaries of societal expectations. And yet, we find ourselves mired in a quagmire of fear and intolerance, where the very notion of two people loving one another is seen as a threat to the established order.\n\nBut what of the civil rights that accompany marriage? The rights to property, to inheritance, to healthcare, and to the companionship of one's partner in times of sickness and in health? These are not privileges reserved for the dominant culture, but rather, they are fundamental rights that should be afforded to all. And yet, we find that in our society, the mere presence of a partner's loved one is not enough to grant them the right to sit by their side in the hospital, to make medical decisions on their behalf, or to claim their inheritance.\n\nThe science is clear: gay couples are not somehow less capable of forming lasting, loving relationships than their heterosexual counterparts. In fact, studies have shown that the factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction are the same for all couples, regardless of orientation.\n\nBut still, we find ourselves mired in a sea of ignorance, where the notion of marriage is tied to the whims of the church, rather than the law. Where the state is seen as a bastion of morality, rather than a protector of individual rights. And it is here that we find our greatest failing - the failure to recognize that the government's role is not to impose its will, but to protect the rights of all its citizens.\n\nThe echoes of segregation and inequality still linger in our collective consciousness, a reminder of the dark chapters of our past. And yet, we continue to perpetuate a system that denies the rights of a marginalized group, simply because of their orientation. It is a moral failing of the highest order, one that we can no longer afford to ignore.\n\nAs for the concerns about children and adoption, let us not be swayed by the whispers of fear and doubt. The studies are clear: children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted, just as happy, and just as successful as those raised by heterosexual parents. And as for the argument that children will be influenced by their parents' orientation, let us not forget that it is the love and commitment of the parents that shapes their children, not their orientation.\n\nAnd so, I stand in opposition to the amendment that seeks to ban gay marriage. I stand in opposition to the notion that the government should impose its will on a group of citizens, simply because of their orientation. I stand in opposition to the ignorance and intolerance that has been masquerading as morality, and I stand in support of the fundamental human right to love and to be loved, regardless of one's orientation.",
            "The hospital pharmacy where I toil carries a weight of contradiction. On one hand, the strictures of the law dictate what we dispense, and yet, we find ourselves bound to the efficacy of those very substances we are told to repress. The notion that a thing's legality should dictate its utility is a notion I find hard to swallow. Take, for instance, the controlled substances we utilize with frequency: oxycodone, Vicodin, and Perocets. These medicines, though proscribed, hold within them the power to heal, to soothe the afflicted. And yet, we are told that another substance, one derived from the earth, holds no such virtue.\n\nThere exists a peculiar taboo surrounding this particular plant, one that seems to defy the logic of our actions. We permit the sale of substances that can lead to dependence and despair, and yet, we revile one that has been shown to bring solace. The argument that marijuana, if accessible, would be abused is a tired one. We have seen, time and time again, that the criminalization of a substance only serves to drive its allure, to create a mystique that surrounds it like a shroud.\n\nI propose a different path. One that acknowledges the plant's potential, its medicinal properties, and its capacity to bring comfort. By slowly dismantling the stigma attached to marijuana, we might foster a culture of responsible use. It is not a panacea, nor is it a replacement for the hard work of reforming the way we think about addiction. But it is a step forward, one that recognizes the complexity of the issue, and the need for a more nuanced approach.\n\nThe image of marijuana, that distorted caricature of a substance, must be dispelled. We must see it for what it is: a tool, a means to an end, a plant with the power to heal. And when we do, perhaps we will begin to see the world in a different light, one where the lines between good and evil are not so neatly drawn. Perhaps then we will be able to approach the issue of addiction with a sense of nuance, of compassion, and of understanding.",
            "The church, a bastion of tradition and ritual, has slowly begun to yield to the creeping tendrils of modernity. Gone are the days of starched collars and somber demeanor. Sundays now see the faithful, young and old, in attire ranging from the saccharine to the slovenly. The morning masses, once a time for pomp and circumstance, have been reduced to a mere thirty minutes, a hurried affair in which the devout can be seen in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the Sunday finery of yore.\n\nI recall my own childhood, spent within the hallowed halls of a private school, where Sundays were a time for communal worship and socializing with friends. The ritual of dressing up, a tradition passed down through generations, was an integral part of the experience. But now, the younger generation has brought about a change, one that I both welcome and bemoan. The air of informality is a far cry from the reverent atmosphere I once knew.\n\nAs for the allegations of pedophilia within the church, I believe it is a canker that cannot be excised by simple reforms. The notion that allowing female priests or married clergy would have prevented these atrocities is a naive one. The root of the problem lies not in the institution, but in the individual. Men, married or unmarried, can still harbor the darkness that drives them to such unspeakable acts. I think it is a matter of genetics, a tangled web of predisposition and inclination that cannot be easily unraveled. The church, in its attempts to reckon with this scourge, must not be held accountable for the failings of its members.\n\nIt is a cruel irony that some argue the church's strictures against marriage and family are to blame for the very sins that plague it. But I would counter that the reverend on Seventh Heaven, a man of faith and family, is a testament to the fact that there are those who can balance their spirituality with the demands of the flesh. If the church's teachings are to be taken seriously, then perhaps it is not the institution that requires reform, but the hearts of those who would seek to do harm.\n\nIn the end, it is not the church that needs to change, but the men who would seek to exploit its sacred trust. If the church knew of these atrocities and chose to conceal them, then shame on them indeed. But I fear that is not the case in all instances. The darkness that afflicts us is a complex and multifaceted thing, and no single solution can hope to excise it.",
            "The pall of unease still clung to the nation like a shroud in the aftermath of those fateful days in September. The Bush administration's eagerness to invade Iraq was a pretext, a thin veil of justification born of fear and anger. They wove a tapestry of lies, intertwining the specter of Osama Bin Laden with Saddam Hussein, claiming the latter possessed the very WMDs that would justify their actions. But the cloth was soon to unravel, leaving behind a trail of deceit and a people's trust shattered.\n\nThe administration's disregard for truth was palpable, a stench that clung to their very being. Colin Powell's subsequent confession, a mea culpa of sorts, only served to underscore the depths of their malfeasance. To lie to the American people is a transgression of the highest order, an impeachable offense that seared the nation's conscience.\n\nTheir disregard for the constitution was a symptom of a deeper rot, a cancer that had taken root since the events of September 11th. The younger Bush, driven by a thirst for vengeance, had set his sights on Saddam Hussein, a vendetta born of his father's unfinished business. The true intent, however, was to secure the region's energy resources, a prize to be taken by any means necessary.\n\nThe war had dragged on, a festering wound that refused to heal. Withdrawal was a prospect fraught with peril, the country teetering on the brink of civil war. The alternative, a coalition of regional powers, held its own dangers, threatening the very sovereignty of Iraq. The interim government, a fragile edifice, teetered on the edge of collapse, its parliament a mere shadow of a representative body. The forces of radicalism continued to vie for power, their influence a corrosive force that threatened to consume the nation whole.\n\nThe Prime Minister's grasp on power was tenuous at best, his authority undermined by the very factions he sought to control. The party of Muktada al-Sadr, a force to be reckoned with, held sway in the parliament, their influence a potent reminder of the country's fractured politics. The very fabric of the nation was strained to the breaking point, a delicate balance of power that threatened to shatter at any moment.\n\nIn the face of such turmoil, the nation's voice was reduced to a whispered caution, a hesitant admission that the Iraq war had become a quagmire, a quagmire of deceit and bloodshed that refused to be escaped.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a conversation, a candid voice hesitates, lost in the labyrinth of its own uncertainty. It stammers, as if the very weight of the question crushes it. \"War in Iraq...it's a thing that's hard to grasp,\" it begins, like a man lost in a desert with no map.\n\n\"We never declared it, not like we're supposed to,\" the voice continues, the words tumbling forth like a confession. \"It's a war without a name, a war without a purpose. We went in to get back at them, to avenge the wounds of 9/11. But that's not how it worked out.\" The voice trails off, like a dying ember.\n\nIn the silence, the weight of the world settles, a crushing burden that threatens to consume. \"We're building democracy, but it's a long way to go, and the cost is high. We're stuck, like a bird caught in a thorn bush. We can't leave, or they'll turn on us, and we'll be the ones to blame. But if we stay, we're just making things worse. We're trying to mold them in our image, to make them into something they're not.\"\n\nThe voice pauses, like a man lost in thought. \"I don't know what to say. I don't know what's right. But I do know that it's hard to see the families, the ones who've lost loved ones, the ones who've been torn apart by this war. They're not just statistics, they're people, with lives and hopes and dreams.\" The voice cracks, like a branch breaking under the weight of the wind.\n\n\"But then again, there's the culture, the way they live, the way they think. We're trying to change them, to make them into something we can understand. But we're only making things worse. We're fueling the fire that's burning within them, the hatred that's been festering for so long. The Al-Kaida, the dictatorship, it's all just a symptom of a deeper rot. And we're the ones who're spreading the disease.\"\n\nThe voice fades, like a whisper in the wind. \"It's a mess, a tangled web of contradictions and half-truths. I don't know what's right, but I do know that it's hard to keep going on like this. We're stuck in a cycle of violence, of retaliation, of hate. And it's hard to see a way out, a way to break free from this cycle of pain.\"\n\nThe voice trails off, lost in the silence, a small, fragile thing in a world that's too big, too loud, too cruel.",
            "The notion of the state imposing its will upon the sacred is an affront to the very fabric of our constitution. The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of our democracy, is designed to safeguard the freedom of the faithful from the grasp of temporal power. And yet, it seems to me that this fundamental principle is being willfully ignored in the push for a constitutional amendment to codify a particular worldview.\n\nThe constitution is replete with warnings against the conflation of church and state. To suggest that it is the duty of the government to dictate the mores of the faithful is to invite a tyranny of the majority, where the whims of the powerful are imposed upon the weak. The assertion that this amendment would somehow preserve the integrity of our institutions is a hollow one, for it would merely serve to entrench the privilege of one faith over others.\n\nIt is the churches, not the state, that should be entrusted with the power to guide the faithful. The constitution's declaration of separation was not a mere suggestion, but a clarion call to safeguard the rights of all, regardless of creed. To ignore this imperative is to court disaster, and to invite the very chaos that we seek to prevent.\n\nThe motivations behind this amendment are suspect, driven as they are by personal conviction rather than a genuine concern for the common good. The notion that the government should impose its will upon the people in this matter is a recipe for disaster, a surefire path to the very kind of intolerance that our constitution was designed to prevent.\n\nIn the end, it is not the government that should be involved in this matter, but the churches themselves. For it is they who possess the authority to guide the faithful, not the state. And as for the argument that this amendment would somehow boost the economy or improve society, I remain unconvinced. The only certain outcome is that it would erode the very foundations of our democracy, and plunge us into a darkness from which we may never recover.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict that has left an indelible mark on the sands of time. It was a war born of deceit, its inception shrouded in a veil of half-truths and manipulated emotions. The American people were led to believe that the invasion was a necessary response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, a twisted narrative that blurred the lines between cause and effect. But the truth, much like the desert sands, shifted and swirled, revealing the stark reality of a war driven by ulterior motives.\n\nA war, much like the one that scarred the Vietnamese landscape, a war that was waged on foreign soil with little regard for the local populace. The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a cautionary tale of a conflict that had left a nation in ruins, its people embroiled in a cycle of violence and despair. And yet, like the cursed soldiers of the past, the American government marched forward, blinded by a hubris that would lead them down a path of destruction.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's regime was but a ruse, a thinly veiled attempt to assert American dominance over the region. The aftermath, a void of power, a maelstrom of chaos, was met with an unpreparedness that was as staggering as it was predictable. The Iraqi people, like the Vietnamese before them, were left to pick up the pieces, their lives forever changed by the ravages of war.\n\nThe notion of democracy, that sacred institution, was peddled as a panacea, a cure-all for the ills of the region. But the reality was far more complex, a delicate dance of power and politics, of competing interests and hidden agendas. The American government, with its vaunted ideals, was shown to be woefully unprepared for the task at hand, its arrogance and complacency leading to a quagmire that would prove impossible to extricate.\n\nThe toll of war, the lives lost, the families torn apart, the innocent caught in the crossfire – all these and more weighed heavily on the conscience of the American people. And yet, like the Sisyphean task that it was, the war raged on, fueled by a mix of posturing and politics, of oil and interest. The question that lingered, like a specter, was why Iraq, and not others? The answer, as with so many things, lay in the realm of the profane, the pursuit of power and control.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a conflict that will be remembered for generations to come, a reminder of the devastating consequences of unchecked ambition and the hubris of those who claim to lead. As the dust settles, and the bodies are counted, one thing is clear: the true cost of war is not measured in dollars and cents, but in the very fabric of humanity itself.",
            "The matter of gay marriage weighs heavily on my mind. It is a question of fundamental humanity, one that I have long held dear. The notion that the union of two individuals should be circumscribed by societal norms and arbitrary decrees is an affront to the very essence of freedom. The trend of scientific inquiry has, in recent years, shed light upon the biological underpinnings of desire, rendering the notion of inherent predilection increasingly difficult to ignore. It is a truth that cannot be dismissed, a truth that speaks to the inherent nature of the human experience.\n\nThe attempt to impose a singular definition upon marriage, a definition predicated upon the whims of a select few, is a travesty. It is a breach of the trust that underlies our most fundamental relationships. In the quiet streets of my hometown, where families in all their forms coexist in harmony, it is a spectacle that plays out with such tragic regularity: love unacknowledged, vulnerability unspoken. The notion that the state should intrude upon this most intimate of unions, to dictate the terms of devotion, is a grotesque affront to the human condition.\n\nThe notion that biology and environment are inextricably linked is a truth that has been borne out by the evidence. The idea that an individual's predilection is a product of chance, rather than some arbitrary decree, is a notion that resonates deeply. The fact that our society continues to cling to a notion of marriage that is at once archaic and unyielding is a testament to our collective myopia.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of human experience, marriage is a thread that weaves together the very fabric of our existence. It is a sacrament, a bond that transcends the mundane and speaks to the eternal. To reduce it to a mere political football, a pawn in the grand game of power, is a travesty. The notion that two individuals, their love and commitment unwavering, should be reduced to a spectacle, a sideshow for the consumption of the masses, is a cruelty of the highest order.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, when the din of the world recedes, it is clear: the matter of gay marriage is a question of basic human decency. It is a question of justice, of equality, of the unyielding commitment to the inherent worth of every individual. It is a question that must be answered with conviction, with compassion, and with a deep and abiding respect for the human spirit.",
            "The void of the internet stretches out before us, a chasm of the unknown where words and thoughts are stripped bare of their context, left to be devoured by an insatiable hunger. When we cast our words into this digital expanse, we surrender them to the whims of the world. The forum of the internet is a place where the publicly unspoken becomes the quietly whispered, where the jest is oft misinterpreted, and the seriousness of intent is lost in the labyrinthine corridors of the digital realm.\n\nAs an RA, I've witnessed firsthand the crushing weight of words unleashed upon the world. The ease with which a careless remark can set aflame the embers of concern, the way a hastily posted thought can ignite a maelstrom of unease, is a sobering reminder of the perils that lurk within the click of a button. The concrete halls of our school, once a bastion of learning and growth, become a tinderbox of anxiety when the words of the internet are brought to bear.\n\nIn the absence of a clear distinction between jest and earnest, we're left to navigate the treacherous waters of interpretation. Can we truly know what to take seriously, or are we forever bound to the whims of the individual, their words and actions reduced to a complex web of nuance and misinterpretation? The experiment gone awry, the sociology class that devolves into chaos, the innocent prank that takes on a life of its own – these are the cautionary tales that whisper through the digital void, a reminder that our words are never truly our own.\n\nWhen a threat is brought to the attention of the school officials, the lines between invasion of privacy and vigilance are blurred. The friend who looks through the digital footprints of another, seeking to uncover the intent behind the words, is caught in a bind of conflicting desires – to protect and to intrude. The officials, bound by duty to act, must navigate this treacherous landscape, ever mindful of the fine line between prudence and overreach.\n\nA too-curious eye, a too-knowing gaze, can be a heavy burden to bear. The teacher who takes on a pseudonym, the RA who befriends their residents – these are the trespassers in the digital wilderness, their intentions opaque, their motives unclear. And so we must be cautious, lest we forget that the words we cast into the void are forever lost to us, their meaning twisted and distorted by the unforgiving light of the digital age.",
            "The war has been drawn out, its purpose lost in the haze of time like a dying ember consumed by the winds of circumstance. What began as a noble endeavor to restore the fragile flame of democracy in a land long shrouded in tyranny has given way to a desultory campaign, a war of attrition fought for its own sake. The original impulse, to free a people from the shackles of oppression, has been supplanted by a more cynical calculus, a desire to prove the mettle of our own power.\n\nThe motivations behind the war, already suspect from the outset, were tainted by the lingering enmity between our leaders and the dictator we sought to unseat. The father's vendetta, a wound that would not heal, left its mark on the proceedings, casting a long shadow over the justifications for our intervention.\n\nWe achieved our initial goal in the early days of the conflict, a clarion call to the world that we would not stand idly by in the face of tyranny. But the war, like a festering wound, has refused to heal. It has dragged on, a Sisyphean task, with no end in sight. The original purpose, now a distant memory, has given way to a more pedestrian concern: the need to prove our dominance, to demonstrate our military might to a world grown weary of our presence.\n\nWe pour billions of dollars into this endless conflict, a hemorrhage of resources that would be better spent on the pressing needs of our own people. The wars within our own borders, the struggles of poverty and inequality, cry out for attention, but our leaders, blinded by their own ambition, turn a deaf ear. The cost of war, measured in lives and treasure, is a heavy toll to pay for a cause that has long since been lost.\n\nIn the end, it is not the enemy that threatens our very way of life, but our own hubris, our refusal to acknowledge the futility of our endeavor. We are prisoners of our own making, trapped in a war that has outlived its purpose, a war that has become a self-perpetuating machine, driven by its own momentum. It is time to stop, to acknowledge the futility of our efforts and to redirect our resources towards the pressing needs of our own people. For in the end, it is not the enemy that we must defeat, but our own shortsightedness, our willingness to sacrifice our own well-being on the altar of power and prestige.",
            "The notion of someone stumbling upon a profile, a digital footprint, and thereby preventing a life from being lost, raises questions about the delicate balance between surveillance and the anonymity of the internet. It is a truth we must confront: in the vast expanse of cyberspace, our most intimate secrets are laid bare for the world to see. On platforms like Myspace, where one's profile is but a threshold to a world of personal information, we are forced to confront the reality that our private lives are but a fleeting notion. To post one's thoughts, one's desires, one's deepest fears, is to invite the gaze of the unknown.\n\nThe scenario presented is a stark reminder of the perils of the digital age. Can we truly say that our online interactions are private when the boundaries between public and private are increasingly blurred? The notion that one must consent to share their profile with another, only to have that very act be a tacit invitation to scrutiny, is a curious one. We are drawn into a world where the notion of permission is but a distant memory.\n\nIt is a double-edged sword: on one hand, the internet offers us a means to connect with others, to share our thoughts and experiences with a world at large. On the other, it exposes us to the cold calculations of those who would seek to exploit our vulnerabilities. The idea of having a person dedicated to monitoring the online activities of students, searching for signs of malfeasance, raises the specter of a surveillance state. Is this not a form of discrimination, where the notion of innocence is but a distant memory?\n\nThe case of the high school that banned Myspace raises further questions about the limits of authority. Can a school dictate what its students may and may not do in their private lives, even when those efforts are made in the name of safety? The line between protection and intrusion is a fine one, and it is a line that we must tread with care.\n\nIn the end, the internet is a double-edged sword. It allows us to connect, to share, and to learn, but it also exposes us to the darker aspects of human nature. As we navigate this vast and ever-changing landscape, we must be aware of the perils that lurk within.",
            "The Iraq War.  A maelstrom of blood and ash that stains the pages of history, a calamity that refuses to be contained.  I find myself drawn into the morass, a reluctant voice joining the chorus of dissent.  To speak out against it now, to claim the mantle of foresight, seems a hollow exercise, a retrospective virtue that rings hollow in the face of hindsight.  Yet, it is precisely this kind of cowardice that has led us down the path of devastation, the craven reluctance to acknowledge the futility of our endeavors.\n\nThe numbers tell the tale: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, a vast and unbridgeable gulf between our ideals and their realities.  The Iraqi people, those we sought to liberate, now call for our departure, their voices a defiant whisper in the face of our hubris.  Even among our own troops, the dissent grows, a creeping sense of disillusionment that threatens to consume us all.\n\nWe speak of democracy, of bringing light to a benighted land, but it is a fiction, a cruel joke played upon the people of the Middle East.  We mistake our own values for universals, our own culture for the one true way.  The chasm between our world and theirs is a yawning abyss, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the most well-intentioned of efforts.\n\nSaddam was a tyrant, to be sure, but was he not also a symptom of a far deeper malaise?  A cancer that we have chosen to ignore, to pretend that we can excise with a scalpel, rather than confront the rot that lies at the heart of our own assumptions.\n\nWe are lost in this quagmire, our every move met with failure, our every intention thwarted by the very people we sought to help.  The statistics scream out at us: eighty percent of Iraqis desire our departure, a quarter calling for our immediate withdrawal.

Perhaps it is time to admit that our presence is a hindrance, a stumbling block to the very progress we claim to seek.  We may never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we can strive to be something less than the villains we have become.",
            "The specter of gender discrimination haunts the American landscape like a specter, its presence felt in the very marrow of our society. It is a grievous wound that refuses to heal, a scar that festers with each passing day. It is not a problem of men versus women alone, but a complex interplay of roles and expectations that have been etched into the psyche of our collective consciousness.\n\nIn the workplace, the glass ceiling still looms large, a constant reminder that equality remains an elusive dream. Women, in particular, find themselves trapped in a labyrinth of societal expectations, where their abilities are often dismissed in favor of the familiar and the tried. The boardroom, once a bastion of masculine power, slowly yields to the steady march of progress, as women rise through the ranks, their competence and leadership undeniable.\n\nAnd yet, the same forces that propel women forward also hold them back. In industries where fashion and style reign supreme, men are often judged on their appearance, their very masculinity called into question if they dare to venture into a traditionally female domain. The expectation that men should be breadwinners, providers, and protectors weighs heavy on those who choose to defy convention, to stay at home and nurture their families. The world looks down upon them, viewing their decision as a betrayal of their masculinity.\n\nBut this is not a one-way street. Discrimination cuts both ways, its blade slicing through the social fabric with equal ferocity. A man from a humble background, with a grammar that may not be polished, yet a mind that is sharp as a razor, may find himself shunned by his peers, his words dismissed as those of a simpleton. The prejudices of birth and upbringing can be as insidious as those of gender, and just as crippling.\n\nChange is a slow and painful process, one that requires patience and persistence. It is a battle fought on multiple fronts, with progress often measured in inches rather than miles. And yet, it is a battle worth waging, for it is only by acknowledging and confronting these deep-seated biases that we may begin to heal the wounds of the past and forge a more just and equitable future. In this, we must promote the qualities that make us human, rather than trying to force a revolution that will only meet with resistance. It is a delicate balance, one that requires us to walk the tightrope of progress, ever mindful of the fine line between progress and backlash.",
            "The understanding I have of the matter is that it was not fully legalized, but rather decriminalized. This change in the law, I gather, reduced the severity of the offense, reclassifying it as more akin to a traffic infraction – a citation, rather than an arrest and the subsequent entanglements that come with it. The fear of prosecution and the accompanying repercussions, such as difficulties in securing employment or navigating job interviews, still linger, even after decriminalization. \n\nHowever, there exists a pragmatic argument that challenges the former approach. The cost of policing, prosecution, and incarceration is substantial, and one that many municipalities, struggling financially, cannot afford. The process, from arrest to trial, incurs significant expenses: the cost of booking, housing, and appointing public defenders, not to mention the expenditure on the judicial system and state attorneys. \n\nIn places where there is a strong philosophical aversion to this course of action, despite the potential financial benefits that could be redirected towards more pressing concerns – public education, social programs for the elderly, or food assistance for the homeless – the status quo persists. In contrast, cities with a more liberal bent, like Denver, have moved to decriminalize, potentially freeing up resources for more critical needs.\n\nThe issue, however, is not simply a matter of economics or personal freedoms. There are legitimate concerns regarding the proliferation of marijuana, should it become fully legalized. The fear of widespread use, particularly among drivers, remains a valid worry, given its lingering taboo status in many contexts. Moreover, the impact of marijuana on lifestyle choices, as opposed to merely motor skills, cannot be ignored. While both substances carry risks, individuals' responses to them vary greatly, influenced by their unique personalities and capacity for moderation.\n\nUltimately, the complexities of this issue highlight the difficulty in generalizing about the effects of substances. Each person reacts differently, and it is essential to consider this variability when evaluating the merits of decriminalization.",
            "In truth, I find myself drawn to the traditions of the Catholic faith, those timeless practices that have endured for generations, a testament to the indomitable will of those who have come before us. Yet, I am also aware of the dangers of stagnation, of a dogma that refuses to yield to the whispers of a changing world. The rigidity of the Church's stance on certain matters weighs heavily upon me, a tension that can only be resolved by embracing the virtues of compassion and acceptance.\n\nA devout soul, I have seen the weight of doctrine bear down upon those who do not conform, the judgmental gaze of an institution that fails to live up to its own teachings. The memory of my parents' struggles, a union blessed by the Episcopal faith yet rejected by the very Church they sought to join, still lingers, a painful reminder of the schism that can arise when tradition is allowed to supplant love.\n\nAnd so, I find myself questioning the wisdom of a Church that espouses the virtue of love while condemning those who do not meet its narrow standards. It is a hypocrisy that seems to run deep, a refusal to adapt to the world as it is, rather than as it once was. The teachings of the Church, meant to guide us towards a higher truth, often seem to serve only as a means of separation, a barrier that keeps us apart from one another rather than drawing us together in love.\n\nAs for the issue of priests and marriage, I am torn. On one hand, I see the potential benefits of a more inclusive approach, one that might bring an end to the isolation that can breed such darkness. And yet, I fear that the roots of such depravity run too deep, that the act of marriage would not be enough to stem the tide of evil. The bond between a man and child is a different thing altogether, one that cannot be severed by the simple act of matrimony. In the end, it is a problem that cannot be solved by changing the rules, but only by confronting the darkness that lies within.",
            "The line between the sacred and the profane, it is a thin one indeed.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this issue, unable to discern the right path from the wrong.  The confluence of church and state, a chasm that yawns open like an abyss, threatening to consume us all.  The very notion of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil contract to others, is a puzzle that defies solution.\n\nTo define it, to legislate it, to impose one's will upon it, is to risk offending the very fabric of our society.  And yet, we are drawn to it, like moths to a flame, our passions and prejudices aflame.  The civil union, a word that trips off the tongue with ease, yet holds within it the weight of centuries of tradition and expectation.\n\nI am torn, a leaf blown by the winds of doubt.  Should we not see marriage for what it is?  A union of two people, bound together by love and commitment?  Why must we complicate it, with the weight of dogma and the stain of fanaticism?  Is it not enough to acknowledge the fundamental truth of two people, joined in their quest for happiness and companionship?\n\nBut then, there is the matter of the states, each one a sovereign entity, a miniature universe unto itself.  Can we not find a way to reconcile our differences, to arrive at a logical conclusion?  Or are we doomed to stumble forward, like blind men in a darkened room, our hands outstretched, seeking the wall?\n\nA constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, a step taken in haste, without thought or reflection.  Is the issue of gay marriage so grave, so calamitous, that it warrants such drastic action?  I think not.  It is but a symptom, a symptom of a greater disease, a disease of intolerance and misunderstanding.\n\nNo, let us not amend the constitution, let us not alter the very fabric of our society, to accommodate the whims of a select few.  Let us instead, seek the path of wisdom, the path of compassion, the path of understanding.  For it is in the recognition of our shared humanity, that we find the strength to overcome our differences, and to forge a new way forward, a way that is just, and equitable, and true.",
            "In the shadow of a faith that has long been a fixture in my life, I find myself drawn into the twilight of uncertainty, where the certainties of morality are tested by the whispered truths of the heart. The question of homosexuality, a labyrinthine puzzle that has torn asunder the threads of our collective conscience, is one that I grapple with in solitude. I have walked among those who have lived a life outside the bounds of societal norms, their presence a gentle reminder that the boundaries we draw are but a thin line in the vast expanse of humanity.\n\nAnd yet, I find myself at odds with their choices, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, a tempest that rages against the tide of my upbringing. But in the stillness of the night, a clarity arises – that the choices we make are ours to make, and ours alone. The weight of the nation's moral compass, heavy as it may be, should not be the sole arbiter of our moral code.\n\nIn a land of disparate states, each a microcosm of the nation's diverse tapestry, the question of gay marriage becomes a matter of local conscience. Whether the fabric of our society is woven from the threads of tradition or the needle of progress, the choice to marry or not to marry should be left to the discretion of each state. For in the end, it is not the president who will bear the weight of our decisions, but we, the individuals, who will live with them.\n\nI do not pretend to be a seer, but I do see a truth – that the threads of our lives are interwoven, and that the choices we make are not without consequence. The president's role is not to dictate the course of our lives, but to guide us towards a broader vision. And so, I believe that the decision to legalize or not to legalize gay marriage should be left to the states, each a small, burning flame that casts its light upon the darkness.\n\nThe ebb and flow of history, a tide that has seen the rise and fall of empires, will ultimately decide the fate of our nation's moral fabric. And so, I do not covet the power of the president, nor do I believe that his will should be the sole determining factor in our lives. For in the end, it is not he who will live with the consequences of our choices, but we, the individuals, who will bear the weight of our decisions.",
            "The notion that Myspace, a public forum, should be exempt from scrutiny is a notion born of naivety.  In this age, where the lines between private and public have grown increasingly blurred, the expectation of anonymity is a fool's errand.  When one posts on such a platform, they consign their words to the wind, where they can be swept up by an unseen hand.\n\nSchool officials, like any other entity, have the right to surveil the digital landscape, for in it lies the potential for threats to the safety of their domain.  Even if a student's Myspace profile is not explicitly labeled with their school affiliation, the information contained within can still be accessed, its digital footprint tracing back to the school's jurisdiction.  The officials' actions, then, are not an invasion of privacy, but a necessary measure to safeguard the well-being of their students.\n\nLike a sentinel watching for signs of danger, the school officials patrol the digital realm, ever vigilant for indications of potential threats.  And if, in their pursuit, they stumble upon incriminating evidence, it is not an overreach of authority, but a fulfillment of their duty to ensure the safety of their charges.  The argument that they are \"just\" looking for students to get in trouble is a red herring, a distraction from the true purpose at hand: to protect the students from harm.\n\nThe consequences of action, or inaction, are stark.  A single misplaced word, a careless comment, can come back to haunt, its digital echo lingering long after the original iteration has faded into memory.  The notion that one can escape the consequences of their online actions is a myth, a comforting fantasy that offers little solace in the face of the unforgiving digital landscape.\n\nIn the aftermath of Columbine, and the countless other tragedies that have befallen our schools, it is clear that the stakes are high, and the need for vigilance is paramount.  School officials, in their efforts to prevent such calamities, are not overstepping their bounds, but fulfilling their duty to their students, their community, and themselves.",
            "In the aftermath of the calamity that befell us on that fateful day, a maelstrom of emotions churned within me, propelling me headlong into the abyss of war. It was a tempest of vengeance, a torrent of righteous fury that threatened to consume all in its path. But in the cold light of dawn, as the fires of passion died down, I came to realize that our actions were as reckless as they were unconsidered. The void that yawned before us was as dark as it was unforgiving, and we charged in with the unyielding zeal of the ignorant.\n\nWe marched into the heart of chaos, blind to the perils that lay before us, our footsteps echoing through the desolate landscape like the death knell of reason. The land was a labyrinth of ancient hatreds, where the very air was heavy with the weight of a thousand midnights, and we thought to impose our will upon it as if it were a tabula rasa. But the people we sought to transform were as intractable as the earth itself, their hearts as hard as the stones that scarred their hills.\n\nOur presence was a catalyst for the very discord we sought to abate, a spark that ignited a fire that would soon consume us all. We were the strangers in a strange land, our intentions as opaque as the desert skies, and our actions as violent as the sandstorms that ravaged the dunes. We were the agents of a foreign power, our words as hollow as the promises we made to their people, and our actions as cruel as the whims of a merciless deity.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy we had sought to vanquish, but our own hubris. We had embarked upon a crusade of folly, driven by the passions of the moment, rather than the cold calculus of reason. And now, as we withdraw from the devastation we created, we are left to confront the ruins of our own making. The people we sought to liberate remain as entrenched in their ways as ever, their hearts as hardened as the earth we sought to reshape.\n\nWe came to Iraq with the arrogance of the untested, and we leave with the scars of the wounded. Our presence was a fleeting moment in the annals of time, a brief, shining instant of hubris that has given way to the crushing weight of reality. And in the end, it is not the enemy we have defeated, but our own illusions of invincibility."

that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church's stalwart stance, an unyielding fortress of dogma, stands at odds with the flux of modernity. Its followers dwindle as the world shifts, and the Church's unyielding positions on the most pressing issues of our time only serve to widen the chasm. The sacrament of marriage, the sanctity of life, the prohibition on birth control – these are the touchstones around which the faithful are tested, and those who falter are cast aside.\n\nThe weight of tradition bears down upon the Church, an anachronistic relic of a bygone era. Its views on the matters of the heart – love, fertility, and mortality – seem antiquated and inhospitable. The world has moved on, and the Church's refusal to adapt has made it an anathema to those who would seek solace in its teachings.\n\nThe silent majority, those who would rather not be bound by the strictures of the Church's doctrine, are increasingly disillusioned. They see in the Church's stance on abortion, on gay marriage, and on the role of women in the clergy, a rigidity that is at odds with the compassion and understanding that they seek in their faith. They are not comforted by the Church's certainties, but rather repelled by its inflexibility.\n\nThe issue of clerical marriage, too, raises its head. Why, in an age where even the most devoted of professionals are permitted to balance their duties with their personal lives, should priests be denied this simple humanity? Is it not true that a life of devotion to God can coexist with a life of devotion to one's family and community? The Church's answer, that the priest is married to God, rings hollow in the ears of those who would see in the clergy a reflection of the human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the teachings of the Church that are at issue, but its unwillingness to evolve. The world is a complex and multifaceted place, and the Church's refusal to engage with its intricacies has made it a relic of a bygone era. It is time for the Church to adapt, to find a new language that speaks to the hearts of those who would follow it. Anything less would be a betrayal of the very spirit of faith that it seeks to uphold.",
            "The vacillations of the mind, a maelstrom of uncertainty.  One's stance on the matter of gay marriage falters, a hesitant and halting thing.  Yet, a conviction forms, a refusal to acquiesce to the notion that one's nature is a choice.  The born and the made, a distinction that blurs with each passing moment.  Can the human heart truly choose its desires, its inclinations?  Or is it a force beyond our control, a primal urge that cannot be stilled?\n\nThe world judges, and in its judgment, it seeks to condemn.  But what right has it to do so?  Is it not enough to simply exist, to be?  The federal government, a behemoth of power, seeking to impose its will upon the private lives of its citizens.  But what concern is it of theirs?  Is it not enough to leave well enough alone, to permit the individual to chart its own course?\n\nThe weight of societal expectation, a crushing force that seeks to suffocate the soul.  And yet, in the face of this oppression, the human spirit finds a way to persevere.  To be who one is, to love who one loves, to live in the world as one sees fit.  And it is not for others to dictate, to judge, or to condemn.  For in the end, it is not for us to say what is right or wrong, but rather to live in accordance with our own hearts.\n\nIn the silence of the night, one's doubts and fears are laid bare.  But even in the face of uncertainty, a clarity forms, a conviction that cannot be shaken.  The federal government's intrusion into the private lives of its citizens is an affront to the very notion of liberty.  A liberty that is not given, but rather taken, a freedom to live as one sees fit.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of right or wrong, but of the human condition.  A condition that is messy, complex, and multifaceted.  And it is in this complexity that we find our true selves, our true humanity.  So let us not judge, but rather seek to understand.  For in understanding, we may find a glimmer of compassion, a spark of empathy that sets us free.",
            "In the grand tapestry of human existence, there exists a thread of discord - the debate over gay marriage. It is a subject that has long been mired in the muck of misconception and the murk of moral ambiguity. Many a voice has risen to oppose the union, citing the notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family. But such a notion is little more than a specter, a fleeting shadow that vanishes upon closer inspection.\n\nFor in truth, the bond between two individuals, regardless of their orientation, is a sacred thing - a union of love and commitment that defies the petty boundaries of societal expectations. And yet, we find ourselves mired in a quagmire of fear and intolerance, where the very notion of two people loving one another is seen as a threat to the established order.\n\nBut what of the civil rights that accompany marriage? The rights to property, to inheritance, to healthcare, and to the companionship of one's partner in times of sickness and in health? These are not privileges reserved for the dominant culture, but rather, they are fundamental rights that should be afforded to all. And yet, we find that in our society, the mere presence of a partner's loved one is not enough to grant them the right to sit by their side in the hospital, to make medical decisions on their behalf, or to claim their inheritance.\n\nThe science is clear: gay couples are not somehow less capable of forming lasting, loving relationships than their heterosexual counterparts. In fact, studies have shown that the factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction are the same for all couples, regardless of orientation.\n\nBut still, we find ourselves mired in a sea of ignorance, where the notion of marriage is tied to the whims of the church, rather than the law. Where the state is seen as a bastion of morality, rather than a protector of individual rights. And it is here that we find our greatest failing - the failure to recognize that the government's role is not to impose its will, but to protect the rights of all its citizens.\n\nThe echoes of segregation and inequality still linger in our collective consciousness, a reminder of the dark chapters of our past. And yet, we continue to perpetuate a system that denies the rights of a marginalized group, simply because of their orientation. It is a moral failing of the highest order, one that we can no longer afford to ignore.\n\nAs for the concerns about children and adoption, let us not be swayed by the whispers of fear and doubt. The studies are clear: children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted, just as happy, and just as successful as those raised by heterosexual parents. And as for the argument that children will be influenced by their parents' orientation, let us not forget that it is the love and commitment of the parents that shapes their children, not their orientation.\n\nAnd so, I stand in opposition to the amendment that seeks to ban gay marriage. I stand in opposition to the notion that the government should impose its will on a group of citizens, simply because of their orientation. I stand in opposition to the ignorance and intolerance that has been masquerading as morality, and I stand in support of the fundamental human right to love and to be loved, regardless of one's orientation.",
            "The hospital pharmacy where I toil carries a weight of contradiction. On one hand, the strictures of the law dictate what we dispense, and yet, we find ourselves bound to the efficacy of those very substances we are told to repress. The notion that a thing's legality should dictate its utility is a notion I find hard to swallow. Take, for instance, the controlled substances we utilize with frequency: oxycodone, Vicodin, and Perocets. These medicines, though proscribed, hold within them the power to heal, to soothe the afflicted. And yet, we are told that another substance, one derived from the earth, holds no such virtue.\n\nThere exists a peculiar taboo surrounding this particular plant, one that seems to defy the logic of our actions. We permit the sale of substances that can lead to dependence and despair, and yet, we revile one that has been shown to bring solace. The argument that marijuana, if accessible, would be abused is a tired one. We have seen, time and time again, that the criminalization of a substance only serves to drive its allure, to create a mystique that surrounds it like a shroud.\n\nI propose a different path. One that acknowledges the plant's potential, its medicinal properties, and its capacity to bring comfort. By slowly dismantling the stigma attached to marijuana, we might foster a culture of responsible use. It is not a panacea, nor is it a replacement for the hard work of reforming the way we think about addiction. But it is a step forward, one that recognizes the complexity of the issue, and the need for a more nuanced approach.\n\nThe image of marijuana, that distorted caricature of a substance, must be dispelled. We must see it for what it is: a tool, a means to an end, a plant with the power to heal. And when we do, perhaps we will begin to see the world in a different light, one where the lines between good and evil are not so neatly drawn. Perhaps then we will be able to approach the issue of addiction with a sense of nuance, of compassion, and of understanding.",
            "The church, a bastion of tradition and ritual, has slowly begun to yield to the creeping tendrils of modernity. Gone are the days of starched collars and somber demeanor. Sundays now see the faithful, young and old, in attire ranging from the saccharine to the slovenly. The morning masses, once a time for pomp and circumstance, have been reduced to a mere thirty minutes, a hurried affair in which the devout can be seen in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the Sunday finery of yore.\n\nI recall my own childhood, spent within the hallowed halls of a private school, where Sundays were a time for communal worship and socializing with friends. The ritual of dressing up, a tradition passed down through generations, was an integral part of the experience. But now, the younger generation has brought about a change, one that I both welcome and bemoan. The air of informality is a far cry from the reverent atmosphere I once knew.\n\nAs for the allegations of pedophilia within the church, I believe it is a canker that cannot be excised by simple reforms. The notion that allowing female priests or married clergy would have prevented these atrocities is a naive one. The root of the problem lies not in the institution, but in the individual. Men, married or unmarried, can still harbor the darkness that drives them to such unspeakable acts. I think it is a matter of genetics, a tangled web of predisposition and inclination that cannot be easily unraveled. The church, in its attempts to reckon with this scourge, must not be held accountable for the failings of its members.\n\nIt is a cruel irony that some argue the church's strictures against marriage and family are to blame for the very sins that plague it. But I would counter that the reverend on Seventh Heaven, a man of faith and family, is a testament to the fact that there are those who can balance their spirituality with the demands of the flesh. If the church's teachings are to be taken seriously, then perhaps it is not the institution that requires reform, but the hearts of those who would seek to do harm.\n\nIn the end, it is not the church that needs to change, but the men who would seek to exploit its sacred trust. If the church knew of these atrocities and chose to conceal them, then shame on them indeed. But I fear that is not the case in all instances. The darkness that afflicts us is a complex and multifaceted thing, and no single solution can hope to excise it.",
            "The pall of unease still clung to the nation like a shroud in the aftermath of those fateful days in September. The Bush administration's eagerness to invade Iraq was a pretext, a thin veil of justification born of fear and anger. They wove a tapestry of lies, intertwining the specter of Osama Bin Laden with Saddam Hussein, claiming the latter possessed the very WMDs that would justify their actions. But the cloth was soon to unravel, leaving behind a trail of deceit and a people's trust shattered.\n\nThe administration's disregard for truth was palpable, a stench that clung to their very being. Colin Powell's subsequent confession, a mea culpa of sorts, only served to underscore the depths of their malfeasance. To lie to the American people is a transgression of the highest order, an impeachable offense that seared the nation's conscience.\n\nTheir disregard for the constitution was a symptom of a deeper rot, a cancer that had taken root since the events of September 11th. The younger Bush, driven by a thirst for vengeance, had set his sights on Saddam Hussein, a vendetta born of his father's unfinished business. The true intent, however, was to secure the region's energy resources, a prize to be taken by any means necessary.\n\nThe war had dragged on, a festering wound that refused to heal. Withdrawal was a prospect fraught with peril, the country teetering on the brink of civil war. The alternative, a coalition of regional powers, held its own dangers, threatening the very sovereignty of Iraq. The interim government, a fragile edifice, teetered on the edge of collapse, its parliament a mere shadow of a representative body. The forces of radicalism continued to vie for power, their influence a corrosive force that threatened to consume the nation whole.\n\nThe Prime Minister's grasp on power was tenuous at best, his authority undermined by the very factions he sought to control. The party of Muktada al-Sadr, a force to be reckoned with, held sway in the parliament, their influence a potent reminder of the country's fractured politics. The very fabric of the nation was strained to the breaking point, a delicate balance of power that threatened to shatter at any moment.\n\nIn the face of such turmoil, the nation's voice was reduced to a whispered caution, a hesitant admission that the Iraq war had become a quagmire, a quagmire of deceit and bloodshed that refused to be escaped.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a conversation, a candid voice hesitates, lost in the labyrinth of its own uncertainty. It stammers, as if the very weight of the question crushes it. \"War in Iraq...it's a thing that's hard to grasp,\" it begins, like a man lost in a desert with no map.\n\n\"We never declared it, not like we're supposed to,\" the voice continues, the words tumbling forth like a confession. \"It's a war without a name, a war without a purpose. We went in to get back at them, to avenge the wounds of 9/11. But that's not how it worked out.\" The voice trails off, like a dying ember.\n\nIn the silence, the weight of the world settles, a crushing burden that threatens to consume. \"We're building democracy, but it's a long way to go, and the cost is high. We're stuck, like a bird caught in a thorn bush. We can't leave, or they'll turn on us, and we'll be the ones to blame. But if we stay, we're just making things worse. We're trying to mold them in our image, to make them into something they're not.\"\n\nThe voice pauses, like a man lost in thought. \"I don't know what to say. I don't know what's right. But I do know that it's hard to see the families, the ones who've lost loved ones, the ones who've been torn apart by this war. They're not just statistics, they're people, with lives and hopes and dreams.\" The voice cracks, like a branch breaking under the weight of the wind.\n\n\"But then again, there's the culture, the way they live, the way they think. We're trying to change them, to make them into something we can understand. But we're only making things worse. We're fueling the fire that's burning within them, the hatred that's been festering for so long. The Al-Kaida, the dictatorship, it's all just a symptom of a deeper rot. And we're the ones who're spreading the disease.\"\n\nThe voice fades, like a whisper in the wind. \"It's a mess, a tangled web of contradictions and half-truths. I don't know what's right, but I do know that it's hard to keep going on like this. We're stuck in a cycle of violence, of retaliation, of hate. And it's hard to see a way out, a way to break free from this cycle of pain.\"\n\nThe voice trails off, lost in the silence, a small, fragile thing in a world that's too big, too loud, too cruel.",
            "The notion of the state imposing its will upon the sacred is an affront to the very fabric of our constitution. The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of our democracy, is designed to safeguard the freedom of the faithful from the grasp of temporal power. And yet, it seems to me that this fundamental principle is being willfully ignored in the push for a constitutional amendment to codify a particular worldview.\n\nThe constitution is replete with warnings against the conflation of church and state. To suggest that it is the duty of the government to dictate the mores of the faithful is to invite a tyranny of the majority, where the whims of the powerful are imposed upon the weak. The assertion that this amendment would somehow preserve the integrity of our institutions is a hollow one, for it would merely serve to entrench the privilege of one faith over others.\n\nIt is the churches, not the state, that should be entrusted with the power to guide the faithful. The constitution's declaration of separation was not a mere suggestion, but a clarion call to safeguard the rights of all, regardless of creed. To ignore this imperative is to court disaster, and to invite the very chaos that we seek to prevent.\n\nThe motivations behind this amendment are suspect, driven as they are by personal conviction rather than a genuine concern for the common good. The notion that the government should impose its will upon the people in this matter is a recipe for disaster, a surefire path to the very kind of intolerance that our constitution was designed to prevent.\n\nIn the end, it is not the government that should be involved in this matter, but the churches themselves. For it is they who possess the authority to guide the faithful, not the state. And as for the argument that this amendment would somehow boost the economy or improve society, I remain unconvinced. The only certain outcome is that it would erode the very foundations of our democracy, and plunge us into a darkness from which we may never recover.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict that has left an indelible mark on the sands of time. It was a war born of deceit, its inception shrouded in a veil of half-truths and manipulated emotions. The American people were led to believe that the invasion was a necessary response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, a twisted narrative that blurred the lines between cause and effect. But the truth, much like the desert sands, shifted and swirled, revealing the stark reality of a war driven by ulterior motives.\n\nA war, much like the one that scarred the Vietnamese landscape, a war that was waged on foreign soil with little regard for the local populace. The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a cautionary tale of a conflict that had left a nation in ruins, its people embroiled in a cycle of violence and despair. And yet, like the cursed soldiers of the past, the American government marched forward, blinded by a hubris that would lead them down a path of destruction.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's regime was but a ruse, a thinly veiled attempt to assert American dominance over the region. The aftermath, a void of power, a maelstrom of chaos, was met with an unpreparedness that was as staggering as it was predictable. The Iraqi people, like the Vietnamese before them, were left to pick up the pieces, their lives forever changed by the ravages of war.\n\nThe notion of democracy, that sacred institution, was peddled as a panacea, a cure-all for the ills of the region. But the reality was far more complex, a delicate dance of power and politics, of competing interests and hidden agendas. The American government, with its vaunted ideals, was shown to be woefully unprepared for the task at hand, its arrogance and complacency leading to a quagmire that would prove impossible to extricate.\n\nThe toll of war, the lives lost, the families torn apart, the innocent caught in the crossfire – all these and more weighed heavily on the conscience of the American people. And yet, like the Sisyphean task that it was, the war raged on, fueled by a mix of posturing and politics, of oil and interest. The question that lingered, like a specter, was why Iraq, and not others? The answer, as with so many things, lay in the realm of the profane, the pursuit of power and control.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a conflict that will be remembered for generations to come, a reminder of the devastating consequences of unchecked ambition and the hubris of those who claim to lead. As the dust settles, and the bodies are counted, one thing is clear: the true cost of war is not measured in dollars and cents, but in the very fabric of humanity itself.",
            "The matter of gay marriage weighs heavily on my mind. It is a question of fundamental humanity, one that I have long held dear. The notion that the union of two individuals should be circumscribed by societal norms and arbitrary decrees is an affront to the very essence of freedom. The trend of scientific inquiry has, in recent years, shed light upon the biological underpinnings of desire, rendering the notion of inherent predilection increasingly difficult to ignore. It is a truth that cannot be dismissed, a truth that speaks to the inherent nature of the human experience.\n\nThe attempt to impose a singular definition upon marriage, a definition predicated upon the whims of a select few, is a travesty. It is a breach of the trust that underlies our most fundamental relationships. In the quiet streets of my hometown, where families in all their forms coexist in harmony, it is a spectacle that plays out with such tragic regularity: love unacknowledged, vulnerability unspoken. The notion that the state should intrude upon this most intimate of unions, to dictate the terms of devotion, is a grotesque affront to the human condition.\n\nThe notion that biology and environment are inextricably linked is a truth that has been borne out by the evidence. The idea that an individual's predilection is a product of chance, rather than some arbitrary decree, is a notion that resonates deeply. The fact that our society continues to cling to a notion of marriage that is at once archaic and unyielding is a testament to our collective myopia.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of human experience, marriage is a thread that weaves together the very fabric of our existence. It is a sacrament, a bond that transcends the mundane and speaks to the eternal. To reduce it to a mere political football, a pawn in the grand game of power, is a travesty. The notion that two individuals, their love and commitment unwavering, should be reduced to a spectacle, a sideshow for the consumption of the masses, is a cruelty of the highest order.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, when the din of the world recedes, it is clear: the matter of gay marriage is a question of basic human decency. It is a question of justice, of equality, of the unyielding commitment to the inherent worth of every individual. It is a question that must be answered with conviction, with compassion, and with a deep and abiding respect for the human spirit.",
            "The void of the internet stretches out before us, a chasm of the unknown where words and thoughts are stripped bare of their context, left to be devoured by an insatiable hunger. When we cast our words into this digital expanse, we surrender them to the whims of the world. The forum of the internet is a place where the publicly unspoken becomes the quietly whispered, where the jest is oft misinterpreted, and the seriousness of intent is lost in the labyrinthine corridors of the digital realm.\n\nAs an RA, I've witnessed firsthand the crushing weight of words unleashed upon the world. The ease with which a careless remark can set aflame the embers of concern, the way a hastily posted thought can ignite a maelstrom of unease, is a sobering reminder of the perils that lurk within the click of a button. The concrete halls of our school, once a bastion of learning and growth, become a tinderbox of anxiety when the words of the internet are brought to bear.\n\nIn the absence of a clear distinction between jest and earnest, we're left to navigate the treacherous waters of interpretation. Can we truly know what to take seriously, or are we forever bound to the whims of the individual, their words and actions reduced to a complex web of nuance and misinterpretation? The experiment gone awry, the sociology class that devolves into chaos, the innocent prank that takes on a life of its own – these are the cautionary tales that whisper through the digital void, a reminder that our words are never truly our own.\n\nWhen a threat is brought to the attention of the school officials, the lines between invasion of privacy and vigilance are blurred. The friend who looks through the digital footprints of another, seeking to uncover the intent behind the words, is caught in a bind of conflicting desires – to protect and to intrude. The officials, bound by duty to act, must navigate this treacherous landscape, ever mindful of the fine line between prudence and overreach.\n\nA too-curious eye, a too-knowing gaze, can be a heavy burden to bear. The teacher who takes on a pseudonym, the RA who befriends their residents – these are the trespassers in the digital wilderness, their intentions opaque, their motives unclear. And so we must be cautious, lest we forget that the words we cast into the void are forever lost to us, their meaning twisted and distorted by the unforgiving light of the digital age.",
            "The war has been drawn out, its purpose lost in the haze of time like a dying ember consumed by the winds of circumstance. What began as a noble endeavor to restore the fragile flame of democracy in a land long shrouded in tyranny has given way to a desultory campaign, a war of attrition fought for its own sake. The original impulse, to free a people from the shackles of oppression, has been supplanted by a more cynical calculus, a desire to prove the mettle of our own power.\n\nThe motivations behind the war, already suspect from the outset, were tainted by the lingering enmity between our leaders and the dictator we sought to unseat. The father's vendetta, a wound that would not heal, left its mark on the proceedings, casting a long shadow over the justifications for our intervention.\n\nWe achieved our initial goal in the early days of the conflict, a clarion call to the world that we would not stand idly by in the face of tyranny. But the war, like a festering wound, has refused to heal. It has dragged on, a Sisyphean task, with no end in sight. The original purpose, now a distant memory, has given way to a more pedestrian concern: the need to prove our dominance, to demonstrate our military might to a world grown weary of our presence.\n\nWe pour billions of dollars into this endless conflict, a hemorrhage of resources that would be better spent on the pressing needs of our own people. The wars within our own borders, the struggles of poverty and inequality, cry out for attention, but our leaders, blinded by their own ambition, turn a deaf ear. The cost of war, measured in lives and treasure, is a heavy toll to pay for a cause that has long since been lost.\n\nIn the end, it is not the enemy that threatens our very way of life, but our own hubris, our refusal to acknowledge the futility of our endeavor. We are prisoners of our own making, trapped in a war that has outlived its purpose, a war that has become a self-perpetuating machine, driven by its own momentum. It is time to stop, to acknowledge the futility of our efforts and to redirect our resources towards the pressing needs of our own people. For in the end, it is not the enemy that we must defeat, but our own shortsightedness, our willingness to sacrifice our own well-being on the altar of power and prestige.",
            "The notion of someone stumbling upon a profile, a digital footprint, and thereby preventing a life from being lost, raises questions about the delicate balance between surveillance and the anonymity of the internet. It is a truth we must confront: in the vast expanse of cyberspace, our most intimate secrets are laid bare for the world to see. On platforms like Myspace, where one's profile is but a threshold to a world of personal information, we are forced to confront the reality that our private lives are but a fleeting notion. To post one's thoughts, one's desires, one's deepest fears, is to invite the gaze of the unknown.\n\nThe scenario presented is a stark reminder of the perils of the digital age. Can we truly say that our online interactions are private when the boundaries between public and private are increasingly blurred? The notion that one must consent to share their profile with another, only to have that very act be a tacit invitation to scrutiny, is a curious one. We are drawn into a world where the notion of permission is but a distant memory.\n\nIt is a double-edged sword: on one hand, the internet offers us a means to connect with others, to share our thoughts and experiences with a world at large. On the other, it exposes us to the cold calculations of those who would seek to exploit our vulnerabilities. The idea of having a person dedicated to monitoring the online activities of students, searching for signs of malfeasance, raises the specter of a surveillance state. Is this not a form of discrimination, where the notion of innocence is but a distant memory?\n\nThe case of the high school that banned Myspace raises further questions about the limits of authority. Can a school dictate what its students may and may not do in their private lives, even when those efforts are made in the name of safety? The line between protection and intrusion is a fine one, and it is a line that we must tread with care.\n\nIn the end, the internet is a double-edged sword. It allows us to connect, to share, and to learn, but it also exposes us to the darker aspects of human nature. As we navigate this vast and ever-changing landscape, we must be aware of the perils that lurk within.",
            "The Iraq War.  A maelstrom of blood and ash that stains the pages of history, a calamity that refuses to be contained.  I find myself drawn into the morass, a reluctant voice joining the chorus of dissent.  To speak out against it now, to claim the mantle of foresight, seems a hollow exercise, a retrospective virtue that rings hollow in the face of hindsight.  Yet, it is precisely this kind of cowardice that has led us down the path of devastation, the craven reluctance to acknowledge the futility of our endeavors.\n\nThe numbers tell the tale: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, a vast and unbridgeable gulf between our ideals and their realities.  The Iraqi people, those we sought to liberate, now call for our departure, their voices a defiant whisper in the face of our hubris.  Even among our own troops, the dissent grows, a creeping sense of disillusionment that threatens to consume us all.\n\nWe speak of democracy, of bringing light to a benighted land, but it is a fiction, a cruel joke played upon the people of the Middle East.  We mistake our own values for universals, our own culture for the one true way.  The chasm between our world and theirs is a yawning abyss, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the most well-intentioned of efforts.\n\nSaddam was a tyrant, to be sure, but was he not also a symptom of a far deeper malaise?  A cancer that we have chosen to ignore, to pretend that we can excise with a scalpel, rather than confront the rot that lies at the heart of our own assumptions.\n\nWe are lost in this quagmire, our every move met with failure, our every intention thwarted by the very people we sought to help.  The statistics scream out at us: eighty percent of Iraqis desire our departure, a quarter calling for our immediate withdrawal.  And yet, we cling to our folly, blind to the fact that we are not the saviors we pretend to be.\n\nPerhaps it is time to listen to the voices of those we have sought to save.  Perhaps it is time to admit that our presence is a hindrance, a stumbling block to the very progress we claim to seek.  We may never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we can strive to be something less than the villains we have become.",
            "The specter of gender discrimination haunts the American landscape like a specter, its presence felt in the very marrow of our society. It is a grievous wound that refuses to heal, a scar that festers with each passing day. It is not a problem of men versus women alone, but a complex interplay of roles and expectations that have been etched into the psyche of our collective consciousness.\n\nIn the workplace, the glass ceiling still looms large, a constant reminder that equality remains an elusive dream. Women, in particular, find themselves trapped in a labyrinth of societal expectations, where their abilities are often dismissed in favor of the familiar and the tried. The boardroom, once a bastion of masculine power, slowly yields to the steady march of progress, as women rise through the ranks, their competence and leadership undeniable.\n\nAnd yet, the same forces that propel women forward also hold them back. In industries where fashion and style reign supreme, men are often judged on their appearance, their very masculinity called into question if they dare to venture into a traditionally female domain. The expectation that men should be breadwinners, providers, and protectors weighs heavy on those who choose to defy convention, to stay at home and nurture their families. The world looks down upon them, viewing their decision as a betrayal of their masculinity.\n\nBut this is not a one-way street. Discrimination cuts both ways, its blade slicing through the social fabric with equal ferocity. A man from a humble background, with a grammar that may not be polished, yet a mind that is sharp as a razor, may find himself shunned by his peers, his words dismissed as those of a simpleton. The prejudices of birth and upbringing can be as insidious as those of gender, and just as crippling.\n\nChange is a slow and painful process, one that requires patience and persistence. It is a battle fought on multiple fronts, with progress often measured in inches rather than miles. And yet, it is a battle worth waging, for it is only by acknowledging and confronting these deep-seated biases that we may begin to heal the wounds of the past and forge a more just and equitable future. In this, we must promote the qualities that make us human, rather than trying to force a revolution that will only meet with resistance. It is a delicate balance, one that requires us to walk the tightrope of progress, ever mindful of the fine line between progress and backlash.",
            "The understanding I have of the matter is that it was not fully legalized, but rather decriminalized. This change in the law, I gather, reduced the severity of the offense, reclassifying it as more akin to a traffic infraction – a citation, rather than an arrest and the subsequent entanglements that come with it. The fear of prosecution and the accompanying repercussions, such as difficulties in securing employment or navigating job interviews, still linger, even after decriminalization. \n\nHowever, there exists a pragmatic argument that challenges the former approach. The cost of policing, prosecution, and incarceration is substantial, and one that many municipalities, struggling financially, cannot afford. The process, from arrest to trial, incurs significant expenses: the cost of booking, housing, and appointing public defenders, not to mention the expenditure on the judicial system and state attorneys. \n\nIn places where there is a strong philosophical aversion to this course of action, despite the potential financial benefits that could be redirected towards more pressing concerns – public education, social programs for the elderly, or food assistance for the homeless – the status quo persists. In contrast, cities with a more liberal bent, like Denver, have moved to decriminalize, potentially freeing up resources for more critical needs.\n\nThe issue, however, is not simply a matter of economics or personal freedoms. There are legitimate concerns regarding the proliferation of marijuana, should it become fully legalized. The fear of widespread use, particularly among drivers, remains a valid worry, given its lingering taboo status in many contexts. Moreover, the impact of marijuana on lifestyle choices, as opposed to merely motor skills, cannot be ignored. While both substances carry risks, individuals' responses to them vary greatly, influenced by their unique personalities and capacity for moderation.\n\nUltimately, the complexities of this issue highlight the difficulty in generalizing about the effects of substances. Each person reacts differently, and it is essential to consider this variability when evaluating the merits of decriminalization.",
            "In truth, I find myself drawn to the traditions of the Catholic faith, those timeless practices that have endured for generations, a testament to the indomitable will of those who have come before us. Yet, I am also aware of the dangers of stagnation, of a dogma that refuses to yield to the whispers of a changing world. The rigidity of the Church's stance on certain matters weighs heavily upon me, a tension that can only be resolved by embracing the virtues of compassion and acceptance.\n\nA devout soul, I have seen the weight of doctrine bear down upon those who do not conform, the judgmental gaze of an institution that fails to live up to its own teachings. The memory of my parents' struggles, a union blessed by the Episcopal faith yet rejected by the very Church they sought to join, still lingers, a painful reminder of the schism that can arise when tradition is allowed to supplant love.\n\nAnd so, I find myself questioning the wisdom of a Church that espouses the virtue of love while condemning those who do not meet its narrow standards. It is a hypocrisy that seems to run deep, a refusal to adapt to the world as it is, rather than as it once was. The teachings of the Church, meant to guide us towards a higher truth, often seem to serve only as a means of separation, a barrier that keeps us apart from one another rather than drawing us together in love.\n\nAs for the issue of priests and marriage, I am torn. On one hand, I see the potential benefits of a more inclusive approach, one that might bring an end to the isolation that can breed such darkness. And yet, I fear that the roots of such depravity run too deep, that the act of marriage would not be enough to stem the tide of evil. The bond between a man and child is a different thing altogether, one that cannot be severed by the simple act of matrimony. In the end, it is a problem that cannot be solved by changing the rules, but only by confronting the darkness that lies within.",
            "The line between the sacred and the profane, it is a thin one indeed.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this issue, unable to discern the right path from the wrong.  The confluence of church and state, a chasm that yawns open like an abyss, threatening to consume us all.  The very notion of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil contract to others, is a puzzle that defies solution.\n\nTo define it, to legislate it, to impose one's will upon it, is to risk offending the very fabric of our society.  And yet, we are drawn to it, like moths to a flame, our passions and prejudices aflame.  The civil union, a word that trips off the tongue with ease, yet holds within it the weight of centuries of tradition and expectation.\n\nI am torn, a leaf blown by the winds of doubt.  Should we not see marriage for what it is?  A union of two people, bound together by love and commitment?  Why must we complicate it, with the weight of dogma and the stain of fanaticism?  Is it not enough to acknowledge the fundamental truth of two people, joined in their quest for happiness and companionship?\n\nBut then, there is the matter of the states, each one a sovereign entity, a miniature universe unto itself.  Can we not find a way to reconcile our differences, to arrive at a logical conclusion?  Or are we doomed to stumble forward, like blind men in a darkened room, our hands outstretched, seeking the wall?\n\nA constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, a step taken in haste, without thought or reflection.  Is the issue of gay marriage so grave, so calamitous, that it warrants such drastic action?  I think not.  It is but a symptom, a symptom of a greater disease, a disease of intolerance and misunderstanding.\n\nNo, let us not amend the constitution, let us not alter the very fabric of our society, to accommodate the whims of a select few.  Let us instead, seek the path of wisdom, the path of compassion, the path of understanding.  For it is in the recognition of our shared humanity, that we find the strength to overcome our differences, and to forge a new way forward, a way that is just, and equitable, and true.",
            "In the shadow of a faith that has long been a fixture in my life, I find myself drawn into the twilight of uncertainty, where the certainties of morality are tested by the whispered truths of the heart. The question of homosexuality, a labyrinthine puzzle that has torn asunder the threads of our collective conscience, is one that I grapple with in solitude. I have walked among those who have lived a life outside the bounds of societal norms, their presence a gentle reminder that the boundaries we draw are but a thin line in the vast expanse of humanity.\n\nAnd yet, I find myself at odds with their choices, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, a tempest that rages against the tide of my upbringing. But in the stillness of the night, a clarity arises – that the choices we make are ours to make, and ours alone. The weight of the nation's moral compass, heavy as it may be, should not be the sole arbiter of our moral code.\n\nIn a land of disparate states, each a microcosm of the nation's diverse tapestry, the question of gay marriage becomes a matter of local conscience. Whether the fabric of our society is woven from the threads of tradition or the needle of progress, the choice to marry or not to marry should be left to the discretion of each state. For in the end, it is not the president who will bear the weight of our decisions, but we, the individuals, who will live with them.\n\nI do not pretend to be a seer, but I do see a truth – that the threads of our lives are interwoven, and that the choices we make are not without consequence. The president's role is not to dictate the course of our lives, but to guide us towards a broader vision. And so, I believe that the decision to legalize or not to legalize gay marriage should be left to the states, each a small, burning flame that casts its light upon the darkness.\n\nThe ebb and flow of history, a tide that has seen the rise and fall of empires, will ultimately decide the fate of our nation's moral fabric. And so, I do not covet the power of the president, nor do I believe that his will should be the sole determining factor in our lives. For in the end, it is not he who will live with the consequences of our choices, but we, the individuals, who will bear the weight of our decisions.",
            "The notion that Myspace, a public forum, should be exempt from scrutiny is a notion born of naivety.  In this age, where the lines between private and public have grown increasingly blurred, the expectation of anonymity is a fool's errand.  When one posts on such a platform, they consign their words to the wind, where they can be swept up by an unseen hand.\n\nSchool officials, like any other entity, have the right to surveil the digital landscape, for in it lies the potential for threats to the safety of their domain.  Even if a student's Myspace profile is not explicitly labeled with their school affiliation, the information contained within can still be accessed, its digital footprint tracing back to the school's jurisdiction.  The officials' actions, then, are not an invasion of privacy, but a necessary measure to safeguard the well-being of their students.\n\nLike a sentinel watching for signs of danger, the school officials patrol the digital realm, ever vigilant for indications of potential threats.  And if, in their pursuit, they stumble upon incriminating evidence, it is not an overreach of authority, but a fulfillment of their duty to ensure the safety of their charges.  The argument that they are \"just\" looking for students to get in trouble is a red herring, a distraction from the true purpose at hand: to protect the students from harm.\n\nThe consequences of action, or inaction, are stark.  A single misplaced word, a careless comment, can come back to haunt, its digital echo lingering long after the original iteration has faded into memory.  The notion that one can escape the consequences of their online actions is a myth, a comforting fantasy that offers little solace in the face of the unforgiving digital landscape.\n\nIn the aftermath of Columbine, and the countless other tragedies that have befallen our schools, it is clear that the stakes are high, and the need for vigilance is paramount.  School officials, in their efforts to prevent such calamities, are not overstepping their bounds, but fulfilling their duty to their students, their community, and themselves.",
            "In the aftermath of the calamity that befell us on that fateful day, a maelstrom of emotions churned within me, propelling me headlong into the abyss of war. It was a tempest of vengeance, a torrent of righteous fury that threatened to consume all in its path. But in the cold light of dawn, as the fires of passion died down, I came to realize that our actions were as reckless as they were unconsidered. The void that yawned before us was as dark as it was unforgiving, and we charged in with the unyielding zeal of the ignorant.\n\nWe marched into the heart of chaos, blind to the perils that lay before us, our footsteps echoing through the desolate landscape like the death knell of reason. The land was a labyrinth of ancient hatreds, where the very air was heavy with the weight of a thousand midnights, and we thought to impose our will upon it as if it were a tabula rasa. But the people we sought to transform were as intractable as the earth itself, their hearts as hard as the stones that scarred their hills.\n\nOur presence was a catalyst for the very discord we sought to abate, a spark that ignited a fire that would soon consume us all. We were the strangers in a strange land, our intentions as opaque as the desert skies, and our actions as violent as the sandstorms that ravaged the dunes. We were the agents of a foreign power, our words as hollow as the promises we made to their people, and our actions as cruel as the whims of a merciless deity.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy we had sought to vanquish, but our own hubris. We had embarked upon a crusade of folly, driven by the passions of the moment, rather than the cold calculus of reason. And now, as we withdraw from the devastation we created, we are left to confront the ruins of our own making. The people we sought to liberate remain as entrenched in their ways as ever, their hearts as hardened as the earth we sought to reshape.\n\nWe came to Iraq with the arrogance of the untested, and we leave with the scars of the wounded. Our presence was a fleeting moment in the annals of time, a brief, shining instant of hubris that has given way to the crushing weight of reality. And in the end, it is not the enemy we have defeated, but our own illusions of invincibility."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

Its once unwavering hold on the faithful is beginning to slip, and the reason lies not in the erosion of its doctrine, but in the obstinacy of its convictions. The Church's stance on certain matters – marriage, abortion, birth control – is a relic of a bygone era, one that no longer resonates with a world in flux.\n\nThose who once found solace in the Church's teachings now find themselves at odds with its unyielding views. The world has moved on, leaving the Church to cling to anachronistic dogma that is as alienating as it is unforgiving. The consequences are evident: a dwindling flock, a hemorrhaging of adherents who can no longer reconcile the Church's rigidity with their own evolving values.\n\nThe Church's stance on these issues is not merely a matter of faith, but of exclusion. Those who dare to dissent from its teachings are met with silence, ostracism, or worse. The Church's leaders speak of devotion, of a life given over to God, but what of the human experience? What of love, of family, of the messy, beautiful tapestry of life? The Church's absolute commitment to its doctrine is a sterile, loveless thing, one that threatens to suffocate the very essence of what it means to be human.\n\nThe Church's refusal to adapt, to evolve, is a failing of the highest order. Its rigidity is a barrier, a fortress that stands in the way of growth, of understanding, of compassion. The world is not a static entity, and the Church must learn to bend with it, to accommodate the changing tides of human experience. The alternative is a slow, inexorable decline into irrelevance, a fate that is all but sealed.\n\nThe notion that priests cannot be married, that they must devote themselves to a life of celibacy, is a curious one. Is it not enough that they are devoted to their faith? Must they also surrender their very humanity? The Church's leaders speak of a marriage to God, but what of the marriage to another, to a partner, to children, to the world around them? Is this not a love that is no less profound, no less redemptive?\n\nThe Church's stance on these matters is not a matter of conviction, but of dogma. It is a relic of a bygone era, one that has lost touch with the world. The Church must change, must adapt, or risk being left behind in the dust of history. Its very survival depends on it.",
            "The murk of indecision clings to me like a shroud, as I struggle to articulate my thoughts on this most contentious of issues. A plague of uncertainty afflicts me, a weight that presses down upon my conscience. And yet, I shall attempt to find my voice, to speak out against the injustice that threatens to suffocate the souls of those who dare to be different.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of existence, I do not see the threads of choice that bind the fabric of human sexuality. Rather, I believe that the hue of one's nature is woven into the very fabric of their being, an indelible mark that cannot be altered by the whims of man. To hold another accountable for that which they cannot change is to court cruelty, to wield the sword of oppression against those who are powerless to defend themselves.\n\nA nation that would deny the right to marry to those who are born with a different inclination is a nation that has lost its way. It is a creed of exclusion, a doctrine of condemnation that seeks to impose its will upon the very essence of another's being. I would not have it so.\n\nThe federal government, with its heavy hand, should not interject itself into the most intimate aspects of our lives. The business of love and marriage is not a matter for the state to dictate, but rather a sacred trust between two individuals who have chosen to commit to one another. To mandate otherwise is to invite the specter of oppression, to reduce the rich tapestry of human experience to a narrow, suffocating thread.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the rights of all individuals should be sacred and inviolable. To deny the freedom to love and to marry is to deny our very humanity. We should not be the architects of our fellow man's suffering, but rather the guardians of their dignity.\n\nI shall not mince words. The federal government has no business in the private lives of its citizens, least of all when it comes to the most fundamental aspects of our existence. To do so is to surrender to a cruel and heartless calculus, one that values the whims of the powerful over the inherent worth of the marginalized.\n\nLet us not forget that we are all born with our own unique hue, our own particular shade of being. And it is precisely this uniqueness that makes us human. To deny the rights of those who are different is to deny our own humanity. I would not have it so.",
            "In the twilight of our collective conscience, a question lingers, a shadow cast by the principles of equality and justice. The question: should gay marriage be sanctioned by the law. My answer is simple, yet fraught with complexity. There is no reason, no justification, to deny the union of two consenting adults their right to wed.\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional nuclear family is a notion born of ignorance and fear. It is a coin with two sides, yet somehow we've come to believe that one side is tainted, tainted by the very essence of its existence. But this is a falsehood, a lie perpetuated by the darkness that shrouds our understanding of human nature.\n\nThe rights of gay couples are not a separate entity, but an integral part of the fabric of our society. The right to property, the right to healthcare, the right to visit one another in times of need – these are not privileges reserved for the heteronormative. They are fundamental rights, inherent to the human experience.\n\nStudies have shown, time and again, that gay couples are not so different from their straight counterparts. They share the same desires, the same fears, the same hopes. They form relationships that are just as strong, just as resilient, just as loving. And yet, we deny them the one thing that gives meaning to their love – the recognition of their union.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is an affront to religious doctrine is a specious one. The separation of church and state is a fundamental tenet of our democracy. To allow the beliefs of one group to dictate the laws of the land is to undermine the very principles of freedom that we hold dear.\n\nAnd what of the argument that gay couples are somehow less capable of raising children? The evidence suggests otherwise. Children of gay parents are no less well-adjusted, no less happy, than children of straight parents. They are, in fact, no different at all. And as for adoption, it is a decision made by individuals, not by the state.\n\nThe federal government has a duty to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation. To deny gay marriage is to deny the fundamental humanity of a segment of our population. It is a travesty, a mockery of the very ideals that we claim to hold dear.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of morality, but of justice. It is not a question of what some people believe, but of what is right. And what is right is that gay couples should be free to marry, to love, and to live their lives as they see fit, free from the shackles of oppression and fear.",
            "The notion that a substance's legality determines its utility is a notion I find...perplexing. In my experience, working at a hospital pharmacy, I've witnessed firsthand the benefits of certain...forbidden substances. Oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, though classified as controlled substances, are often administered to alleviate suffering. Their efficacy in treating pain and discomfort cannot be denied. Why, then, should we not consider the potential benefits of another substance, one whose only crime is its taboo status?\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is a valid one, but it's a false equivalency. Alcohol, like a raging fire, can consume and destroy. Marijuana, on the other hand, is a more subtle force, one that can be harnessed and controlled. It's a matter of perspective, I suppose. The more we stigmatize a substance, the more we drive people to abuse it. Conversely, by acknowledging its potential, we might encourage responsible use.\n\nThe image of marijuana as a destructive force is a distorted one, born of misinformation and fear. It's not a poison, not a plague. In moderation, it can be a salve, a balm for the afflicted. By shedding the shadows of taboo, we might uncover its true nature, and perhaps, in doing so, we'll find that it's not the devil's brew we've been led to believe, but a tool, like any other, waiting to be wielded wisely.\n\nThe path forward is not a simple one. Gradual, incremental steps might be necessary to ease the transition from prohibition to acceptance. But to deny the substance's potential altogether? That seems a shortsighted approach. By acknowledging its benefits, we might just find a way to harness its power, to make it a force for good, rather than a source of fear and shame.",
            "The church, a stalwart institution, has undergone a metamorphosis, its rigors softened by the passage of time. Gone are the days of strict observance, replaced by a more relaxed atmosphere that welcomes the twenty-first century's entropy. I remember Sundays, a ritual that remained constant throughout my youth – a time for dresses that sparkled like newly fallen snow, shoes that shone like polished obsidian, and a purse to match, a trifecta of elegance that seemed to transcend the mundane. But the passage of time has brought with it a changed landscape, one where teenagers now convene for a truncated mass, its duration a mere thirty minutes, a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of the day.\n\nThe faithful, once attired in their finest, now don casual finery, the summers seeing an influx of beachwear, its wearers no doubt fresh from the waves. Families, once punctual, now arrive late, their tardiness a testament to the changing times. The mornings, once a time for reverent attire, now see jeans and khakis supplant the traditional Sunday best. It is a casualization that is both a symptom and a cause of the world's decay.\n\nBut I digress. It is not the changing nature of the church that has brought me to this fork in the road of reflection. No, it is the more grievous issue of the pedophilia that has besmirched the church's good name. The question lingers: could this scourge have been prevented if the church had taken a different course – one that allowed for female priests, or for priests to take wives? I do not think so. For it is not the institution that creates the monster, but the individual, their predilections forged in the crucible of genetics, not by the strictures of their station. A man, married or unmarried, can still harbor a sick fascination with the young, a sickness that cannot be cured by the sacrament of matrimony.\n\nI recall a conversation with a reverend, a man of the cloth who had chosen a different path, one that allowed him to walk the tightrope of faith and love, to balance the scales of devotion and desire. But even he, in his own words, was not immune to the frailties of human nature. And so, I ask you, what is the relevance of the institution in preventing such horrors? It is not the trappings of power or the strictures of dogma that create the pedophile, but the individual's own darkness, a stain that cannot be washed away by the waters of reform.\n\nIf the church knew of these transgressions and chose to conceal them, then they are guilty of a more grievous sin still – the sin of omission. But I do not think that is the case. I think it is a sickness that has always lurked, hidden from view, its symptoms only now beginning to manifest. And so, I have no further thoughts on the matter, only a sense of sadness and loss, a recognition that the world is a more complicated, more broken place than we would like to admit.",
            "The stench of deceit clung to the premises that led us into Iraq like a shroud. September 11th still seared the nation, its wounds fresh and gaping. The Bush administration seized upon this vulnerability, their words dripping with a fervent conviction that Saddam Hussein was the architect of the atrocity. But this narrative, like a pitiful thread, unraveled all too soon, its fragile fabric revealed for the lie it was. There were no WMDs, no connections to Osama Bin Laden, only a labyrinthine web of deceit spun by those who would stop at nothing to justify their actions.\n\nTheir disregard for the truth was a cancer, eating away at the very fabric of our republic. The memory of Colin Powell's presentation at the UN still lingers, a hollow testament to the ease with which the administration could have deceived even its own stalwarts. The notion that this was an impeachable offense hung in the air, a specter of malfeasance that refused to be vanquished.\n\nThis was a presidency that had never truly grasped the Constitution, its clauses and amendments mere suggestions to be ignored or circumvented at whim. Since 9/11, a façade of patriotism had been erected, a thin veil hiding the true intentions of those who held power. The younger Bush's animus towards Saddam Hussein was a palpable thing, a vendetta born of familial legacy and a desire to expand our dominion over the region. The pursuit of oil, like a dark and insidious force, drove their actions.\n\nBut the war raged on, a tired and faltering thing. The thought of withdrawal was a daunting one, the prospect of civil war and its attendant horrors a grim reality that hung in the balance. The UN's proposed solution, a coalition of neighboring nations to restore order, seemed a tenuous thing, a temporary fix that would only delay the inevitable. Iraq's sovereignty, once a distant concept, now hung precariously in the balance, its dissolution a very real possibility.\n\nThe Parliament, a shell of its former self, limped along, its members at odds with one another. The Prime Minister, a figurehead at best, struggled to exert any meaningful control. The fractious elements that had so long plagued the nation still lingered, their grip on power tenuous but unyielding. It was a maelstrom of competing interests, a chaos that seemed to have no end in sight.\n\nIn this maelstrom, the American people were left to pick up the pieces, their voices muted by the din of war. The stench of deceit still lingered, a reminder of the wounds that would never fully heal. But it was a wound that needed to be opened, to be laid bare for all to see. For it was only then that we might begin to heal, to find our way back to the principles that had once defined us.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A tangled skein of blood and sorrow, of fractured lives and shattered dreams.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of my own thoughts, struggling to grasp the threads of this maddening narrative.  It began as a response, a retaliatory strike against those who had wrought havoc upon our soil.  But now, as the seasons have passed, it has devolved into a futile exercise in futility.\n\nThe nation's resolve, once tempered like steel in the fire of outrage, has grown tarnished and cold.  We speak of building democracy, of spreading freedom's flame to a land beset by darkness, but do we truly comprehend the complexity of this endeavor?  Or are we blinded by our own hubris, our vaunted ideals reduced to a hollow echo of a bygone era?\n\nThe world is a vast and unforgiving expanse, where the boundaries between right and wrong blur like the shifting sands of the desert.  We speak of oil, of resources and power, but do we not forget that we are not the only ones who have a stake in this land?  The people of Iraq, their lives torn asunder by our presence, their children torn from their families, their culture reduced to rubble.\n\nAnd yet, I find myself torn, a leaf blown by the winds of doubt.  Do I wish for peace, for the withdrawal of our troops, or do I cling to the notion that our presence is a necessary evil, a shield against the gathering storm of terrorism?  I think of the families torn apart, the loved ones left behind, and my heart aches with a sense of responsibility, of guilt.\n\nBut then, like a specter from the past, the memory of Vietnam rises, a cautionary tale of the futility of our endeavors.  We speak of building a new nation, of shaping the future in our image, but do we not risk repeating the mistakes of the past, of imposing our will upon a people who desire nothing more than to be left alone?\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions.  The war in Iraq, a labyrinth without a center, a maze with no exit.  And I am but a traveler, lost in the depths of my own uncertainty, searching for a glimmer of hope in a world gone mad.",
            "The notion that a state might presumptuously declare its own sovereignty over the sacred, that it might dictate what is lawful and what is not, strikes a discordant note. The constitution, that venerable document, does indeed enshrine the principle of separation between church and state. It is a distinction that has served as a bulwark against the suffocating weight of dogma, a bulwark that has allowed for the free exercise of faith, unencumbered by the heavy hand of government.\n\nTo tamper with this delicate balance, to seek to impose a particular creed or conviction upon the populace, would be a betrayal of the very spirit that animates our democracy. It would be a willful disregard for the careful craftsmanship of our founding fathers, men who knew that the separation of church and state was the linchpin of our liberty.\n\nThe proponents of this amendment, driven by their own fervent convictions, would have us believe that their way is the only way. But what of those who hold differing views? Shall we not respect the diversity of our faiths, each with its own sacred texts and traditions? The Catholics, the Christians, they are not the only adherents to a higher power. Theirs is but one voice in a cacophony of faiths, each with its own claim to truth.\n\nAnd what of the constitution itself? Shall we not be bound by its words, its clear and unambiguous declaration of the separation of church and state? An amendment, one that would seek to restrict the freedom of conscience, would be a negation of all that we hold dear. It would be a reversal of the very principles that have made our nation great.\n\nThe president's zeal for this amendment, driven as it is by his own personal convictions, betrays a troubling disregard for the pluralism that is the very essence of our democracy. His actions would serve only to enforce the dominance of one faith over others, a dominance that is anathema to the spirit of our constitution. We must not allow this to stand.\n\nThe economy, the society, what of them? Would this amendment truly have a salutary effect? Or would it merely serve to stifle the free exercise of faith, to strangle the diversity that is our greatest strength? I think not. In the end, it is not for the government to dictate what is and is not lawful. It is for the churches, in their wisdom and their deliberation, to speak to the matters of the soul.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict that ravaged the very fabric of that forsaken land, a war that left an indelible stain on the collective conscience of our nation. From the outset, it was clear that the government's motives were shrouded in a veil of deceit. The reasons for our invasion were murky, a tangled web of half-truths and convenient fabrications, designed to exploit the raw emotions of a nation still reeling from the shock of 9/11.\n\nThe parallels between this conflict and the Vietnam War are striking. In both cases, we sought to impose our will upon a foreign land, to remake it in our image, to impose a democracy that we deemed superior to the native governance. But we forgot the lessons of history, the lessons of the long and bloody struggle to establish our own democracy. We forgot that freedom is not a gift to be bestowed, but a hard-won right, earned through the blood and sacrifice of countless souls.\n\nThe aftermath of our invasion was a perfect storm of chaos and destruction. We removed the existing government, leaving a power vacuum that our own government was ill-prepared to fill. The Iraqi people, like the Vietnamese before them, were caught in the crossfire, their lives shattered by the violence and terror that we unleashed. And still, we continue to pour our young men and women into the abyss, sacrificing them on the altar of a war that seems to have no end.\n\nThe truth is, we were never truly prepared for the consequences of our actions. We were blinded by our own hubris, our own conviction in the righteousness of our cause. We were convinced that we could remake Iraq in our image, that we could impose our will upon a people who did not want us there. But the people of Iraq are not so easily swayed. They resisted our occupation, and we responded with force, perpetuating a cycle of violence that shows no signs of abating.\n\nAnd at the heart of it all, the oil. The lure of black gold, the promise of wealth and power that drove us to invade a country that posed no threat to us. We spoke of democracy and freedom, but in truth, it was always about control, about access to the resources that sustain our way of life. We justify our actions by pointing to the existence of North Korea, a country with which we have a very different relationship. But the truth is, our motives are not so noble. We are driven by self-interest, by a desire for power and riches that knows no bounds.\n\nAs I look back on this conflict, I am filled with a sense of sadness and regret. I am reminded of the countless lives lost, the families shattered, the communities destroyed. And I am left to wonder, will it ever end? Will we ever find peace in Iraq, or will we continue to perpetuate a cycle of violence that only seems to grow more entrenched with each passing day? I fear that we may never find the answer to these questions, that the war in Iraq will forever be a stain on our collective conscience, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the hubris of a nation that forgets the lessons of history.",
            "The notion of gay marriage, a conundrum that has long plagued the fringes of our society, has been a concern of mine for as long as I can remember. It is a matter of personal preference, a truth that has been borne out by the proliferation of scientific discovery. The evidence mounts, a mountain of proof that inclines towards the notion that one's orientation is inextricably tied to the intricate dance of biology, rather than the capricious whims of societal conditioning.\n\nTo deny individuals the right to marry, to love, and to build a life together based on something as ephemeral as societal expectation seems a cruel and inhumane proposition. It is a concept that reeks of a paternalistic impulse, a desire to impose one's will upon another, to dictate the terms of their existence.\n\nIn my hometown, I have witnessed firsthand the quiet dignity of couples, their love and commitment to one another unwavering, despite the weight of societal disapproval. They walk among us, unassuming and unremarkable, their love a testament to the power of the human heart. And yet, they are denied the simple right to formalize their union, to have their love recognized and sanctified by the state.\n\nThe notion that the President or any branch of government should presume to define the meaning of marriage, to impose their will upon the hearts of others, is a notion that strikes me as laughable. Marriage is a personal, private affair, a bond between two individuals that should not be subject to the whims of politics or the ambitions of those in power.\n\nI have read and studied the research, the scientific findings that suggest that one's orientation may be determined by biology, rather than upbringing or environment. The evidence is compelling, a accumulation of facts that point to a truth that is both astonishing and liberating.\n\nUltimately, the issue of gay marriage is a matter of equality, of simple human decency. It is a question of whether we, as a society, are willing to recognize the humanity of all individuals, to treat them with the respect and dignity they deserve. Or, whether we shall continue to impose our will upon them, to dictate the terms of their existence, and to deny them the simple right to love and be loved in return.",
            "The abyss of the internet stretches out before us, a void that swallows all we hold dear. When we cast our thoughts and words into its expanse, they become the property of the world, subject to the whims of those who dare to gaze upon them. And if we speak of things that unsettle the air, of malice or of violence, the whispers of others will take on a life of their own. The school officials, bound by duty to safeguard their charges, must tread this perilous ground with care. They are not merely passive witnesses to our digital footprints; they are the first line of defense against the darkness that seethes beneath the surface.\n\nThe internet, a great and unforgiving expanse, holds no sanctuaries from prying eyes. What we post, we post for the world to see. The bulletin boards of Myspace and Facebook, the whispered confessions of LiveJournal entries, all lie exposed to the gaze of those who would seek to do us harm. And when the warning signs are sounded, the officials must act, lest the threads of fate be snarled beyond redemption.\n\nBut how are we to discern the truth from the jest, the sincerity from the guile? The lines blur and the distinctions grow faint. A sociology experiment gone awry, a prank taken too far, or a genuine cry for help – which is it? The uncertainty gnaws at us, a constant reminder that our words have consequences we cannot fully comprehend.\n\nThe case at hand is a stark reminder of this fact. A careless phrase, meant as a jest, became a catalyst for concern. The consequences of our actions, the trail of breadcrumbs we leave behind, can lead us down a path from which we cannot turn back. The officials, bound by duty, must navigate this labyrinth with caution, lest they unravel the very fabric of trust that holds our community together.\n\nAnd yet, we would do well to remember that this is a two-way street. If we seek to shield ourselves from the prying eyes of others, we must be mindful of the doors we open, the keys we hand to those who would seek to know our secrets. The school officials, though well-intentioned, must be mindful of the boundaries they cross, lest they trespass on the territory of the personal.\n\nBut I digress. The fact remains: in this vast and uncaring expanse, our words have power. They can be the spark that sets the flame of chaos ablaze, or the whispered secret that saves a life. We would do well to remember this, and to wield our words with the care and respect they deserve.",
            "The war has dragged on, a desiccated husk of its former purpose. Once, a spark of idealism had driven us, a flame of democracy flickering in the darkness. But time has worn it down, a slow erosion of ideals, a gradual surrender to the void. We began with a righteous intent - to bring freedom to a land oppressed, to plant the seeds of liberty in a soil long barren.\n\nBut the seasons have passed, and the landscape has shifted. Our purpose has been lost to the sands, buried beneath the weight of our own hubris. We sought to prove our strength, to assert our dominance over a world we do not fully comprehend. The ghosts of George Bush's father still linger, whispers of a vendetta long past. The original spark, that flame of democracy, was suffocated by the weight of personal agendas.\n\nWe accomplished what we set out to do in the early days, a statement made in blood and fire. But the war has dragged on, a morass of unyielding conflict. Years have passed, and still we linger, a people drained of purpose. Our economy bleeds, a slow hemorrhage of dollars spent on a cause long since lost. Our own wounds, the poverty and decay that gnaws at our own doorstep, go unattended. We squander what little we have on a war that has become a mere exercise in futility.\n\nBillions of dollars are spent, a river of gold flowing into the void. But what of the roads that crumble, the schools that falter, the healthcare that withers? We have our own wars to fight, our own demons to slay. And yet we pour our treasure into a foreign land, a senseless slaughter of our own sons and daughters. The cause is lost, the war a mere charnel house of our own making.",
            "The notion that a life was saved due to someone's prying gaze on the internet weighs heavy on my mind. It brings forth a question: in a world where the boundaries between private and public are blurred, do we have any expectation of solitude? The internet, a vast expanse of information, swallows all that we choose to share. Myspace, a platform where one's innermost thoughts and desires are laid bare, invites the gaze of the unknown. By posting one's profile, a person surrenders a measure of control, acquiescing to the notion that others may scrutinize their every thought.\n\nThis is not an invasion of privacy, per se, but rather the awareness that our words and actions have consequences. On Myspace, the veil of secrecy is lifted, and one must accept that their profile is accessible to those who seek it out. It is a trade-off: the freedom to express oneself online in exchange for the exposure that comes with it. The burden of responsibility falls upon the individual to navigate these boundaries, to discern what is wise to share and what is best kept hidden.\n\nAnd yet, the prospect of someone scouring the depths of the internet, searching for any sign of malfeasance, raises its own set of questions. Can we entrust the task of surveillance to an individual, tasked with the duty of parsing the intentions of their peers? Or does this become an exercise in paternalism, where the authorities seek to control the thoughts and actions of the young? The line between protection and intrusion is a fine one, and the consequences of crossing it are far-reaching.\n\nI, for one, am cautious in my online interactions. I have a Facebook profile, a digital persona that I present to the world. But I am aware that even the most seemingly innocuous information can be wielded as a tool. A screen name, a photo, a post – all these can be used to unlock the door to my inner world. It is a delicate balance, one that I strive to maintain, but one that is ever-shifting.\n\nThe story of the man who exploited a girl's vulnerability on the internet haunts me still. It is a stark reminder of the darker aspects of human nature, and the ease with which they can be unleashed. And yet, it also speaks to the power of the internet, a force both liberating and terrifying.\n\nIn the end, the issue remains a complex one, with no easy answers. The school's decision to ban Myspace was seen as an overreach, a restriction on the freedom to express oneself. But was it not a necessary measure, a means of protecting the vulnerable? The truth lies in the gray areas, where the boundaries between right and wrong are constantly shifting. It is a terrain that we must navigate with care, ever mindful of the consequences of our actions.",
            "The weight of war hangs heavy over us, a specter of regret that clings to every decision, every action, every thought. The Iraq War, a calamity born of hubris and miscalculation, a disaster that has left scarred landscapes and shattered lives in its wake. I speak of it now, a reluctant participant in a chorus of condemnation, a voice joining the tide of dissent that has grown to a deafening roar.\n\nThe numbers tell the tale: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, including the Iraqi people themselves, believe the war to be a grave mistake. The soldiers who fight, the civilians who suffer, all concur: the war was a folly, a catastrophic misstep that has brought only chaos and despair. And yet, like quicksand, the war's pull is relentless, drawing us deeper into a quagmire of our own making.\n\nThe fault lines run deep, a chasm between our culture and that of the Middle East, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the clumsy hand of colonialism or the simplistic promise of democracy. We sought to impose our will on a people, to bring order to a land torn asunder by conflict and division. But the people of Iraq have spoken, their voices a cacophony of disapproval, their message clear: leave us be, leave us to our own devices, to our own destiny.\n\nAnd yet, we remain, like an unwelcome guest, a presence that is resented and resented. The administration's promises, its justifications, its flimsy rationales for continued occupation are thin gruel indeed. We have heard them all before, the arguments for staying the course, for seeing it through to the bitter end. But I have yet to hear a compelling reason why we should prolong this farce, this charade of occupation and occupation's promises.\n\nEighty percent of Iraqis demand our departure, and yet we cling to our convictions, our ideologies, our notions of what is best for them. We are the outsiders, the interlopers, and they are the ones who know their land, their culture, their lives best. Perhaps it is time to listen to their voices, to heed their cries for departure. For in their words, we might find a glimmer of hope, a chance to redeem ourselves, to extricate ourselves from this quagmire of our own making.\n\nBut no, we will not leave, will not extricate ourselves from this entanglement. We will continue to occupy, to meddle, to impose our will on a people who do not want us. And so the war will drag on, a tired, tattered, and defeated thing, a monument to our folly, our arrogance, our inability to listen, to understand, to learn.",
            "The specter of gender bias still lingers in the United States, a cancer that gnaws at the very fabric of our society.  It is not solely a women's issue, for it is tied to the specific realm of work one inhabits.  In the hallowed halls of business, the glass ceiling still bars the way to advancement for women, who toil beneath the weight of expectation that they shall never supplant their male counterparts.  A legacy of patriarchal thinking, forged over centuries, has convinced many that women are not suited to positions of authority.  And so they are relegated to the lower rungs, despite their qualifications, as the powerful remain entrenched in their seats of power.\n\nBut the phenomenon is not unique to women; men too are subject to the whims of societal expectation.  A man who chooses to stay at home and care for his children is viewed with suspicion, his masculinity called into question.  The notion that a man should be the sole breadwinner has been ingrained in us for so long that any deviation from this norm is met with scorn.  And so the stay-at-home father is forced to endure the slings and arrows of a society that cannot comprehend his choice.\n\nAnd then there is the fashion industry, where men who dare to enter the realm of aesthetics are met with skepticism.  Their masculinity is questioned, their style seen as suspect, as if they are mere imitators of the feminine ideal.  They are, in effect, seen as outsiders, their perspective deemed irrelevant to the world of fashion.\n\nBut change is afoot, slow and halting as it may be.  Women are rising through the ranks, taking on positions of power, and shattering the glass ceiling that once stood in their way.  Men too are beginning to challenge the traditional notion of masculinity, opting to stay at home and care for their children.  And the fashion industry, too, is slowly coming to accept the notion that men can be tastemakers, that their perspective is valuable.\n\nThe key to progress lies not in force, but in subtle persuasion.  By highlighting the qualities of those who have been marginalized, we can begin to chip away at the edifice of prejudice that holds us back.  And so, we must celebrate the achievements of women in business, and the stay-at-home fathers who defy convention.  We must recognize that intelligence and worth are not tied to grammar or geography, but to character and determination.  For it is only through acceptance and understanding that we can hope to vanquish the specter of bias that haunts us still.",
            "In a world where the boundaries of morality are constantly shifting, one can't help but ponder the implications of a changing landscape. The once-thought-profound line between right and wrong has been muddled, as the notion of marijuana's legality has been altered, its status downgraded from a felony to a mere citation. It is a curious thing, this decriminalization, a move that seeks to absolve the petty offenses of the past, and redirect the focus towards more pressing concerns.\n\nBut make no mistake, the reverberations of such a change still linger. The specter of a marijuana charge still haunts the dreams of the young and the old alike, its presence a constant reminder of the precarious nature of societal expectations. The specter of a public defender, a judge, and the dim prospects of a future weighed down by the burden of a conviction – these are the shadows that dance upon the walls of a society still grappling with the implications of a changing tide.\n\nAnd yet, the weight of logic dictates that such a shift be considered. For the costs of arrest, of prosecution, of housing and of the countless other expenses that accompany the machinery of law enforcement are a heavy burden to bear. In municipalities struggling to stay afloat, the notion of decriminalization takes on a new light – a financial reprieve, a chance to redirect resources towards more pressing concerns.\n\nBut it is not merely a matter of economics that drives this conversation. It is the deeper, more primal fears of a society that still grapples with the notion of a substance that exists in a gray area, neither quite fully accepted nor fully rejected. The image of a world where marijuana is as ubiquitous as cigarettes, where its use is normalized, is a prospect both tantalizing and repellent. It is a world where the boundaries between right and wrong are further blurred, where the very notion of moral certitude is called into question.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of moderation, of individual character. For just as the effects of marijuana can vary from person to person, so too can the effects of its legalization. Some will find a world where the substance is normalized to be a liberating force, a chance to explore the depths of their own humanity. Others will find it a corrupting influence, a slippery slope that leads down a path of degradation and despair. The truth, as it often is, lies somewhere in between.",
            "The traditions of the Catholic Church are a weighty burden, a legacy of time-honored practices that have been observed with unyielding fervor.  For generations, they have remained steadfast, unmoving, as the world around them shifts and evolves.  It is a virtue to be rooted in the ancient ways, to cling to the certainties of the past, but it is also a vice to be inflexible, to refuse the gentle whispers of change.\n\nThe Church's doctrine is a labyrinth of contradictions, a maze of absolutes that often defy the ideals it purports to uphold.  The command to love one's neighbor, to accept and forgive, is a notion that is as old as the Church itself, yet it is often lost in the fervor of righteousness that drives its adherents.  The exclusivity of its traditions, the rigid adherence to a narrow set of dogma, is a stark contrast to the very principles it claims to hold dear.\n\nI was raised in a household where the tensions between faith and family were palpable.  My parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, found themselves at odds over the most fundamental aspects of their relationship.  The Church's refusal to recognize their union, to bless their love, was a harsh reminder of the intolerance that lies at the heart of its doctrine.  It is a hypocrisy that is as old as the Church itself, a paradox that has been perpetuated for centuries.\n\nThe issue of priestly marriage is a symptom of this larger problem, a microcosm of the Church's inability to reconcile its ideals with its practices.  Some argue that allowing priests to marry would be a step towards reform, a way to humanize the institution and bring it closer to the people.  Others claim that it would only serve to embolden the worst excesses of its ministers, to legitimize the very behaviors that have come to define the Church's darkest hours.  The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between.\n\nThe pedophiles who prey on the innocent do not need the privilege of marriage to indulge their depravities.  Their crimes are a product of a far deeper sickness, one that cannot be cured by simple changes in policy.  The issue is not one of marriage or celibacy, but of the very fabric of the Church itself.  Its failures are not the result of its traditions, but of its refusal to confront its own darkness.",
            "The proposition weighs heavily on my mind, a maelstrom of conflicting sentiments and treacherous terrain.  To take a stance, to declare one side right and the other wrong, would be to invite the very discord that we seek to avoid. And yet, the issue at hand is a labyrinth of tangled threads, each one knotted around the central problem: the delicate balance between the church and the state. Marriage, that most intimate of unions, lies at the heart of the matter, a sacrament to some, a civil arrangement to others.\n\nI am unsure, lost in the wilderness of this debate, whether marriage should be defined by the government's hand or left to the whims of the church. The notion of a civil union seems a more fitting description, a bond between two people, free from the encumbrance of state interference. After all, what is marriage, but a union of two souls, unencumbered by the trappings of the law?\n\nThe issue of gay marriage, in particular, has become a contentious point, a flashpoint in the ongoing struggle for equality. But is it truly a matter worthy of constitutional amendment? I think not. The Constitution is a document crafted to safeguard the fundamental rights of all citizens, not to codify the prejudices of a select few.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of proportion. Is the issue of gay marriage significant enough to warrant the altering of the foundational document of our nation? I think not. It is a matter of personal conviction, not a cornerstone of our republic. Leave it to the states to decide, and let the people of this great nation settle the matter as they see fit.",
            "In the stark, unforgiving light of day, I find myself grappling with the complexities of a notion that has been etched into the fabric of our society - the notion of homosexuality. Raised in a household bound by the tenets of Christianity, I have come to regard this subject as a twilight realm, a gray area where the certainties of right and wrong blur like the horizon at dawn.\n\nThe friendships I have forged with individuals who identify as homosexual have left an indelible mark on my perspective, and while I may not fully concur with their lifestyle, I believe that the issue of legalization should be resolved by the very ones it affects most - the people of each state. It is a matter of local governance, not a dictate from the federal throne.\n\nAs the bastions of democracy and republicanism stand in stark relief across the American landscape, it is only natural that varying opinions on the matter would prevail. Democratic states, with their emphasis on individual freedom, would likely champion the cause of gay marriage, while their Republican counterparts might stand opposed. Yet, in a land where the right to choose one's domicile is a fundamental tenet, it is incumbent upon those who reside within a particular state to respect the will of its people.\n\nI do not believe that the President, no matter his office or title, should impose his will upon the nation. Such a decision would be an affront to the principles of local autonomy and the sacred trust that resides within each state's borders. The people of a state, having chosen to reside there, should be the ones to decide the course of their own affairs.\n\nThe ephemeral nature of presidential tenure - a span of mere years, a fleeting moment in the annals of time - only serves to underscore the impermanence of such edicts. A president's decision, like the wind that rustles through the trees, is transitory, subject to reversal by the whims of his successor. The people, on the other hand, remain, their will and their resolve a constant presence, a testament to the enduring power of local governance.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the President to dictate the terms of our society, but for the people of each state to chart their own course. Only in this way can we truly say that we are governed by the will of the people, not the fiat of a distant authority.",
            "The public nature of Myspace is a hard truth, a reflection of the world's gaze upon us all. It is a realm where the veil of privacy is thin, where the words we speak can be heard by any who would listen. When a student posts on Myspace, they must consider the consequences of their words, for they are not speaking in a vacuum, but in a space where the eyes of strangers and authorities alike may fall upon them.\n\nThe school officials, in their duty to ensure the safety of their students, may indeed access such public spaces. It is a responsibility they have, a weighty burden that they must bear. And if, in the course of their duties, they come across a post that hints at a threat, a spark that might ignite a flame of violence, is it not their right to intervene? Is it not their duty to prevent the calamity that might befall their students?\n\nThe notion that they should not snoop, that they should respect the privacy of their students, is a notion that rings hollow in these times. For in a world where the threads of our lives are so intricately woven together, where a careless word or deed can spread like wildfire, is it not the duty of those in authority to be vigilant? To anticipate the potential dangers that lurk in the shadows?\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher, one who spoke of the drills they conducted, the preparations they made for the unthinkable. The lockdowns, the evacuations, the drills to prepare for the worst. It was a reality they faced, a reality that haunted them. And in this context, the actions of the school officials take on a different hue. They were not snooping, they were preparing. They were not invading privacy, they were protecting lives.\n\nThe world is a complex tapestry, woven from threads of light and darkness. And in this tapestry, the actions of the school officials are but a small part. Yet, it is a part that speaks to the greater whole. They acted not out of malice, but out of a desire to protect. And in doing so, they served not just their students, but the greater good.",
            "The war.  A maelstrom of chaos that ravaged our collective soul.  I recall the initial fervor that coursed through me like a raging river, fueled by the searing pain of September eleventh.  The memory of that day still lingers, a festering wound that refuses to heal.  In its aftermath, I was all but consumed by a desire for retribution, for vengeance against those who had wrought such devastation.  The call to arms was loud, a clarion cry that echoed through the land, and I answered, my heart afire with purpose.\n\nBut the further we delved into the abyss, the more I saw the chaos that we sowed.  The seeds of our haste and hubris sprouted forth, bearing bitter fruit that we could not reap.  We charged into the unknown, unprepared and unyielding, our eyes fixed on a horizon that shrouded itself in uncertainty.  And in that void, we lost ourselves, our actions driven by emotion rather than reason.\n\nNow, as I reflect on those halcyon days, I am left with a sense of disillusionment.  The people we sought to free from tyranny remain ensnared in their own cycle of violence, their internal strife a cancer that devours them whole.  And we, with our good intentions and our hubris, only served to fan the flames.  Our presence, a constant reminder of our own vulnerability, has only bred more hatred, more resentment.\n\nThe truth is, we are not the ones to bring order to a land beset by such ancient animosities.  We are not the saviors that we once thought ourselves to be.  Our actions, though well-intentioned, have only served to hasten our own departure, for we cannot stay in a land that is not ours to claim.  And so, we toil, a Sisyphean task, pushing against the tide of history, only to be swept back by the very currents we sought to tame.\n\nIt is a bitter pill to swallow, but one that we must acknowledge: our presence in that land has been a hindrance, a burden that we cannot bear.  We must leave, not for the sake of those we sought to help, but for our own sake.  For in staying, we only perpetuate the cycle of violence, and in leaving, we acknowledge the futility of our endeavor.  It is a hard truth, but one that we must confront, lest we continue to sow the seeds of chaos, and reap a harvest of sorrow."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church stands at a precipice, its edifice weathered by the tempests of time. Its once unwavering hold on the faithful is beginning to slip, and the reason lies not in the erosion of its doctrine, but in the obstinacy of its convictions. The Church's stance on certain matters – marriage, abortion, birth control – is a relic of a bygone era, one that no longer resonates with a world in flux.\n\nThose who once found solace in the Church's teachings now find themselves at odds with its unyielding views. The world has moved on, leaving the Church to cling to anachronistic dogma that is as alienating as it is unforgiving. The consequences are evident: a dwindling flock, a hemorrhaging of adherents who can no longer reconcile the Church's rigidity with their own evolving values.\n\nThe Church's stance on these issues is not merely a matter of faith, but of exclusion. Those who dare to dissent from its teachings are met with silence, ostracism, or worse. The Church's leaders speak of devotion, of a life given over to God, but what of the human experience? What of love, of family, of the messy, beautiful tapestry of life? The Church's absolute commitment to its doctrine is a sterile, loveless thing, one that threatens to suffocate the very essence of what it means to be human.\n\nThe Church's refusal to adapt, to evolve, is a failing of the highest order. Its rigidity is a barrier, a fortress that stands in the way of growth, of understanding, of compassion. The world is not a static entity, and the Church must learn to bend with it, to accommodate the changing tides of human experience. The alternative is a slow, inexorable decline into irrelevance, a fate that is all but sealed.\n\nThe notion that priests cannot be married, that they must devote themselves to a life of celibacy, is a curious one. Is it not enough that they are devoted to their faith? Must they also surrender their very humanity? The Church's leaders speak of a marriage to God, but what of the marriage to another, to a partner, to children, to the world around them? Is this not a love that is no less profound, no less redemptive?\n\nThe Church's stance on these matters is not a matter of conviction, but of dogma. It is a relic of a bygone era, one that has lost touch with the world. The Church must change, must adapt, or risk being left behind in the dust of history. Its very survival depends on it.",
            "The murk of indecision clings to me like a shroud, as I struggle to articulate my thoughts on this most contentious of issues. A plague of uncertainty afflicts me, a weight that presses down upon my conscience. And yet, I shall attempt to find my voice, to speak out against the injustice that threatens to suffocate the souls of those who dare to be different.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of existence, I do not see the threads of choice that bind the fabric of human sexuality. Rather, I believe that the hue of one's nature is woven into the very fabric of their being, an indelible mark that cannot be altered by the whims of man. To hold another accountable for that which they cannot change is to court cruelty, to wield the sword of oppression against those who are powerless to defend themselves.\n\nA nation that would deny the right to marry to those who are born with a different inclination is a nation that has lost its way. It is a creed of exclusion, a doctrine of condemnation that seeks to impose its will upon the very essence of another's being. I would not have it so.\n\nThe federal government, with its heavy hand, should not interject itself into the most intimate aspects of our lives. The business of love and marriage is not a matter for the state to dictate, but rather a sacred trust between two individuals who have chosen to commit to one another. To mandate otherwise is to invite the specter of oppression, to reduce the rich tapestry of human experience to a narrow, suffocating thread.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the rights of all individuals should be sacred and inviolable. To deny the freedom to love and to marry is to deny our very humanity. We should not be the architects of our fellow man's suffering, but rather the guardians of their dignity.\n\nI shall not mince words. The federal government has no business in the private lives of its citizens, least of all when it comes to the most fundamental aspects of our existence. To do so is to surrender to a cruel and heartless calculus, one that values the whims of the powerful over the inherent worth of the marginalized.\n\nLet us not forget that we are all born with our own unique hue, our own particular shade of being. And it is precisely this uniqueness that makes us human. To deny the rights of those who are different is to deny our own humanity. I would not have it so.",
            "In the twilight of our collective conscience, a question lingers, a shadow cast by the principles of equality and justice. The question: should gay marriage be sanctioned by the law. My answer is simple, yet fraught with complexity. There is no reason, no justification, to deny the union of two consenting adults their right to wed.\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional nuclear family is a notion born of ignorance and fear. It is a coin with two sides, yet somehow we've come to believe that one side is tainted, tainted by the very essence of its existence. But this is a falsehood, a lie perpetuated by the darkness that shrouds our understanding of human nature.\n\nThe rights of gay couples are not a separate entity, but an integral part of the fabric of our society. The right to property, the right to healthcare, the right to visit one another in times of need – these are not privileges reserved for the heteronormative. They are fundamental rights, inherent to the human experience.\n\nStudies have shown, time and again, that gay couples are not so different from their straight counterparts. They share the same desires, the same fears, the same hopes. They form relationships that are just as strong, just as resilient, just as loving. And yet, we deny them the one thing that gives meaning to their love – the recognition of their union.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is an affront to religious doctrine is a specious one. The separation of church and state is a fundamental tenet of our democracy. To allow the beliefs of one group to dictate the laws of the land is to undermine the very principles of freedom that we hold dear.\n\nAnd what of the argument that gay couples are somehow less capable of raising children? The evidence suggests otherwise. Children of gay parents are no less well-adjusted, no less happy, than children of straight parents. They are, in fact, no different at all. And as for adoption, it is a decision made by individuals, not by the state.\n\nThe federal government has a duty to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation. To deny gay marriage is to deny the fundamental humanity of a segment of our population. It is a travesty, a mockery of the very ideals that we claim to hold dear.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of morality, but of justice. It is not a question of what some people believe, but of what is right. And what is right is that gay couples should be free to marry, to love, and to live their lives as they see fit, free from the shackles of oppression and fear.",
            "The notion that a substance's legality determines its utility is a notion I find...perplexing. In my experience, working at a hospital pharmacy, I've witnessed firsthand the benefits of certain...forbidden substances. Oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, though classified as controlled substances, are often administered to alleviate suffering. Their efficacy in treating pain and discomfort cannot be denied. Why, then, should we not consider the potential benefits of another substance, one whose only crime is its taboo status?\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is a valid one, but it's a false equivalency. Alcohol, like a raging fire, can consume and destroy. Marijuana, on the other hand, is a more subtle force, one that can be harnessed and controlled. It's a matter of perspective, I suppose. The more we stigmatize a substance, the more we drive people to abuse it. Conversely, by acknowledging its potential, we might encourage responsible use.\n\nThe image of marijuana as a destructive force is a distorted one, born of misinformation and fear. It's not a poison, not a plague. In moderation, it can be a salve, a balm for the afflicted. By shedding the shadows of taboo, we might uncover its true nature, and perhaps, in doing so, we'll find that it's not the devil's brew we've been led to believe, but a tool, like any other, waiting to be wielded wisely.\n\nThe path forward is not a simple one. Gradual, incremental steps might be necessary to ease the transition from prohibition to acceptance. But to deny the substance's potential altogether? That seems a shortsighted approach. By acknowledging its benefits, we might just find a way to harness its power, to make it a force for good, rather than a source of fear and shame.",
            "The church, a stalwart institution, has undergone a metamorphosis, its rigors softened by the passage of time. Gone are the days of strict observance, replaced by a more relaxed atmosphere that welcomes the twenty-first century's entropy. I remember Sundays, a ritual that remained constant throughout my youth – a time for dresses that sparkled like newly fallen snow, shoes that shone like polished obsidian, and a purse to match, a trifecta of elegance that seemed to transcend the mundane. But the passage of time has brought with it a changed landscape, one where teenagers now convene for a truncated mass, its duration a mere thirty minutes, a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of the day.\n\nThe faithful, once attired in their finest, now don casual finery, the summers seeing an influx of beachwear, its wearers no doubt fresh from the waves. Families, once punctual, now arrive late, their tardiness a testament to the changing times. The mornings, once a time for reverent attire, now see jeans and khakis supplant the traditional Sunday best. It is a casualization that is both a symptom and a cause of the world's decay.\n\nBut I digress. It is not the changing nature of the church that has brought me to this fork in the road of reflection. No, it is the more grievous issue of the pedophilia that has besmirched the church's good name. The question lingers: could this scourge have been prevented if the church had taken a different course – one that allowed for female priests, or for priests to take wives? I do not think so. For it is not the institution that creates the monster, but the individual, their predilections forged in the crucible of genetics, not by the strictures of their station. A man, married or unmarried, can still harbor a sick fascination with the young, a sickness that cannot be cured by the sacrament of matrimony.\n\nI recall a conversation with a reverend, a man of the cloth who had chosen a different path, one that allowed him to walk the tightrope of faith and love, to balance the scales of devotion and desire. But even he, in his own words, was not immune to the frailties of human nature. And so, I ask you, what is the relevance of the institution in preventing such horrors? It is not the trappings of power or the strictures of dogma that create the pedophile, but the individual's own darkness, a stain that cannot be washed away by the waters of reform.\n\nIf the church knew of these transgressions and chose to conceal them, then they are guilty of a more grievous sin still – the sin of omission. But I do not think that is the case. I think it is a sickness that has always lurked, hidden from view, its symptoms only now beginning to manifest. And so, I have no further thoughts on the matter, only a sense of sadness and loss, a recognition that the world is a more complicated, more broken place than we would like to admit.",
            "The stench of deceit clung to the premises that led us into Iraq like a shroud. September 11th still seared the nation, its wounds fresh and gaping. The Bush administration seized upon this vulnerability, their words dripping with a fervent conviction that Saddam Hussein was the architect of the atrocity. But this narrative, like a pitiful thread, unraveled all too soon, its fragile fabric revealed for the lie it was. There were no WMDs, no connections to Osama Bin Laden, only a labyrinthine web of deceit spun by those who would stop at nothing to justify their actions.\n\nTheir disregard for the truth was a cancer, eating away at the very fabric of our republic. The memory of Colin Powell's presentation at the UN still lingers, a hollow testament to the ease with which the administration could have deceived even its own stalwarts. The notion that this was an impeachable offense hung in the air, a specter of malfeasance that refused to be vanquished.\n\nThis was a presidency that had never truly grasped the Constitution, its clauses and amendments mere suggestions to be ignored or circumvented at whim. Since 9/11, a façade of patriotism had been erected, a thin veil hiding the true intentions of those who held power. The younger Bush's animus towards Saddam Hussein was a palpable thing, a vendetta born of familial legacy and a desire to expand our dominion over the region. The pursuit of oil, like a dark and insidious force, drove their actions.\n\nBut the war raged on, a tired and faltering thing. The thought of withdrawal was a daunting one, the prospect of civil war and its attendant horrors a grim reality that hung in the balance. The UN's proposed solution, a coalition of neighboring nations to restore order, seemed a tenuous thing, a temporary fix that would only delay the inevitable. Iraq's sovereignty, once a distant concept, now hung precariously in the balance, its dissolution a very real possibility.\n\nThe Parliament, a shell of its former self, limped along, its members at odds with one another. The Prime Minister, a figurehead at best, struggled to exert any meaningful control. The fractious elements that had so long plagued the nation still lingered, their grip on power tenuous but unyielding. It was a maelstrom of competing interests, a chaos that seemed to have no end in sight.\n\nIn this maelstrom, the American people were left to pick up the pieces, their voices muted by the din of war. The stench of deceit still lingered, a reminder of the wounds that would never fully heal. But it was a wound that needed to be opened, to be laid bare for all to see. For it was only then that we might begin to heal, to find our way back to the principles that had once defined us.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A tangled skein of blood and sorrow, of fractured lives and shattered dreams.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of my own thoughts, struggling to grasp the threads of this maddening narrative.  It began as a response, a retaliatory strike against those who had wrought havoc upon our soil.  But now, as the seasons have passed, it has devolved into a futile exercise in futility.\n\nThe nation's resolve, once tempered like steel in the fire of outrage, has grown tarnished and cold.  We speak of building democracy, of spreading freedom's flame to a land beset by darkness, but do we truly comprehend the complexity of this endeavor?  Or are we blinded by our own hubris, our vaunted ideals reduced to a hollow echo of a bygone era?\n\nThe world is a vast and unforgiving expanse, where the boundaries between right and wrong blur like the shifting sands of the desert.  We speak of oil, of resources and power, but do we not forget that we are not the only ones who have a stake in this land?  The people of Iraq, their lives torn asunder by our presence, their children torn from their families, their culture reduced to rubble.\n\nAnd yet, I find myself torn, a leaf blown by the winds of doubt.  Do I wish for peace, for the withdrawal of our troops, or do I cling to the notion that our presence is a necessary evil, a shield against the gathering storm of terrorism?  I think of the families torn apart, the loved ones left behind, and my heart aches with a sense of responsibility, of guilt.\n\nBut then, like a specter from the past, the memory of Vietnam rises, a cautionary tale of the futility of our endeavors.  We speak of building a new nation, of shaping the future in our image, but do we not risk repeating the mistakes of the past, of imposing our will upon a people who desire nothing more than to be left alone?\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions.  The war in Iraq, a labyrinth without a center, a maze with no exit.  And I am but a traveler, lost in the depths of my own uncertainty, searching for a glimmer of hope in a world gone mad.",
            "The notion that a state might presumptuously declare its own sovereignty over the sacred, that it might dictate what is lawful and what is not, strikes a discordant note. The constitution, that venerable document, does indeed enshrine the principle of separation between church and state. It is a distinction that has served as a bulwark against the suffocating weight of dogma, a bulwark that has allowed for the free exercise of faith, unencumbered by the heavy hand of government.\n\nTo tamper with this delicate balance, to seek to impose a particular creed or conviction upon the populace, would be a betrayal of the very spirit that animates our democracy. It would be a willful disregard for the careful craftsmanship of our founding fathers, men who knew that the separation of church and state was the linchpin of our liberty.\n\nThe proponents of this amendment, driven by their own fervent convictions, would have us believe that their way is the only way. But what of those who hold differing views? Shall we not respect the diversity of our faiths, each with its own sacred texts and traditions? The Catholics, the Christians, they are not the only adherents to a higher power. Theirs is but one voice in a cacophony of faiths, each with its own claim to truth.\n\nAnd what of the constitution itself? Shall we not be bound by its words, its clear and unambiguous declaration of the separation of church and state? An amendment, one that would seek to restrict the freedom of conscience, would be a negation of all that we hold dear. It would be a reversal of the very principles that have made our nation great.\n\nThe president's zeal for this amendment, driven as it is by his own personal convictions, betrays a troubling disregard for the pluralism that is the very essence of our democracy. His actions would serve only to enforce the dominance of one faith over others, a dominance that is anathema to the spirit of our constitution. We must not allow this to stand.\n\nThe economy, the society, what of them? Would this amendment truly have a salutary effect? Or would it merely serve to stifle the free exercise of faith, to strangle the diversity that is our greatest strength? I think not. In the end, it is not for the government to dictate what is and is not lawful. It is for the churches, in their wisdom and their deliberation, to speak to the matters of the soul.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict that ravaged the very fabric of that forsaken land, a war that left an indelible stain on the collective conscience of our nation. From the outset, it was clear that the government's motives were shrouded in a veil of deceit. The reasons for our invasion were murky, a tangled web of half-truths and convenient fabrications, designed to exploit the raw emotions of a nation still reeling from the shock of 9/11.\n\nThe parallels between this conflict and the Vietnam War are striking. In both cases, we sought to impose our will upon a foreign land, to remake it in our image, to impose a democracy that we deemed superior to the native governance. But we forgot the lessons of history, the lessons of the long and bloody struggle to establish our own democracy. We forgot that freedom is not a gift to be bestowed, but a hard-won right, earned through the blood and sacrifice of countless souls.\n\nThe aftermath of our invasion was a perfect storm of chaos and destruction. We removed the existing government, leaving a power vacuum that our own government was ill-prepared to fill. The Iraqi people, like the Vietnamese before them, were caught in the crossfire, their lives shattered by the violence and terror that we unleashed. And still, we continue to pour our young men and women into the abyss, sacrificing them on the altar of a war that seems to have no end.\n\nThe truth is, we were never truly prepared for the consequences of our actions. We were blinded by our own hubris, our own conviction in the righteousness of our cause. We were convinced that we could remake Iraq in our image, that we could impose our will upon a people who did not want us there. But the people of Iraq are not so easily swayed. They resisted our occupation, and we responded with force, perpetuating a cycle of violence that shows no signs of abating.\n\nAnd at the heart of it all, the oil. The lure of black gold, the promise of wealth and power that drove us to invade a country that posed no threat to us. We spoke of democracy and freedom, but in truth, it was always about control, about access to the resources that sustain our way of life. We justify our actions by pointing to the existence of North Korea, a country with which we have a very different relationship. But the truth is, our motives are not so noble. We are driven by self-interest, by a desire for power and riches that knows no bounds.\n\nAs I look back on this conflict, I am filled with a sense of sadness and regret. I am reminded of the countless lives lost, the families shattered, the communities destroyed. And I am left to wonder, will it ever end? Will we ever find peace in Iraq, or will we continue to perpetuate a cycle of violence that only seems to grow more entrenched with each passing day? I fear that we may never find the answer to these questions, that the war in Iraq will forever be a stain on our collective conscience, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the hubris of a nation that forgets the lessons of history.",
            "The notion of gay marriage, a conundrum that has long plagued the fringes of our society, has been a concern of mine for as long as I can remember. It is a matter of personal preference, a truth that has been borne out by the proliferation of scientific discovery. The evidence mounts, a mountain of proof that inclines towards the notion that one's orientation is inextricably tied to the intricate dance of biology, rather than the capricious whims of societal conditioning.\n\nTo deny individuals the right to marry, to love, and to build a life together based on something as ephemeral as societal expectation seems a cruel and inhumane proposition. It is a concept that reeks of a paternalistic impulse, a desire to impose one's will upon another, to dictate the terms of their existence.\n\nIn my hometown, I have witnessed firsthand the quiet dignity of couples, their love and commitment to one another unwavering, despite the weight of societal disapproval. They walk among us, unassuming and unremarkable, their love a testament to the power of the human heart. And yet, they are denied the simple right to formalize their union, to have their love recognized and sanctified by the state.\n\nThe notion that the President or any branch of government should presume to define the meaning of marriage, to impose their will upon the hearts of others, is a notion that strikes me as laughable. Marriage is a personal, private affair, a bond between two individuals that should not be subject to the whims of politics or the ambitions of those in power.\n\nI have read and studied the research, the scientific findings that suggest that one's orientation may be determined by biology, rather than upbringing or environment. The evidence is compelling, a accumulation of facts that point to a truth that is both astonishing and liberating.\n\nUltimately, the issue of gay marriage is a matter of equality, of simple human decency. It is a question of whether we, as a society, are willing to recognize the humanity of all individuals, to treat them with the respect and dignity they deserve. Or, whether we shall continue to impose our will upon them, to dictate the terms of their existence, and to deny them the simple right to love and be loved in return.",
            "The abyss of the internet stretches out before us, a void that swallows all we hold dear. When we cast our thoughts and words into its expanse, they become the property of the world, subject to the whims of those who dare to gaze upon them. And if we speak of things that unsettle the air, of malice or of violence, the whispers of others will take on a life of their own. The school officials, bound by duty to safeguard their charges, must tread this perilous ground with care. They are not merely passive witnesses to our digital footprints; they are the first line of defense against the darkness that seethes beneath the surface.\n\nThe internet, a great and unforgiving expanse, holds no sanctuaries from prying eyes. What we post, we post for the world to see. The bulletin boards of Myspace and Facebook, the whispered confessions of LiveJournal entries, all lie exposed to the gaze of those who would seek to do us harm. And when the warning signs are sounded, the officials must act, lest the threads of fate be snarled beyond redemption.\n\nBut how are we to discern the truth from the jest, the sincerity from the guile? The lines blur and the distinctions grow faint. A sociology experiment gone awry, a prank taken too far, or a genuine cry for help – which is it? The uncertainty gnaws at us, a constant reminder that our words have consequences we cannot fully comprehend.\n\nThe case at hand is a stark reminder of this fact. A careless phrase, meant as a jest, became a catalyst for concern. The consequences of our actions, the trail of breadcrumbs we leave behind, can lead us down a path from which we cannot turn back. The officials, bound by duty, must navigate this labyrinth with caution, lest they unravel the very fabric of trust that holds our community together.\n\nAnd yet, we would do well to remember that this is a two-way street. If we seek to shield ourselves from the prying eyes of others, we must be mindful of the doors we open, the keys we hand to those who would seek to know our secrets. The school officials, though well-intentioned, must be mindful of the boundaries they cross, lest they trespass on the territory of the personal.\n\nBut I digress. The fact remains: in this vast and uncaring expanse, our words have power. They can be the spark that sets the flame of chaos ablaze, or the whispered secret that saves a life. We would do well to remember this, and to wield our words with the care and respect they deserve.",
            "The war has dragged on, a desiccated husk of its former purpose. Once, a spark of idealism had driven us, a flame of democracy flickering in the darkness. But time has worn it down, a slow erosion of ideals, a gradual surrender to the void. We began with a righteous intent - to bring freedom to a land oppressed, to plant the seeds of liberty in a soil long barren.\n\nBut the seasons have passed, and the landscape has shifted. Our purpose has been lost to the sands, buried beneath the weight of our own hubris. We sought to prove our strength, to assert our dominance over a world we do not fully comprehend. The ghosts of George Bush's father still linger, whispers of a vendetta long past. The original spark, that flame of democracy, was suffocated by the weight of personal agendas.\n\nWe accomplished what we set out to do in the early days, a statement made in blood and fire. But the war has dragged on, a morass of unyielding conflict. Years have passed, and still we linger, a people drained of purpose. Our economy bleeds, a slow hemorrhage of dollars spent on a cause long since lost. Our own wounds, the poverty and decay that gnaws at our own doorstep, go unattended. We squander what little we have on a war that has become a mere exercise in futility.\n\nBillions of dollars are spent, a river of gold flowing into the void. But what of the roads that crumble, the schools that falter, the healthcare that withers? We have our own wars to fight, our own demons to slay. And yet we pour our treasure into a foreign land, a senseless slaughter of our own sons and daughters. The cause is lost, the war a mere charnel house of our own making.",
            "The notion that a life was saved due to someone's prying gaze on the internet weighs heavy on my mind. It brings forth a question: in a world where the boundaries between private and public are blurred, do we have any expectation of solitude? The internet, a vast expanse of information, swallows all that we choose to share. Myspace, a platform where one's innermost thoughts and desires are laid bare, invites the gaze of the unknown. By posting one's profile, a person surrenders a measure of control, acquiescing to the notion that others may scrutinize their every thought.\n\nThis is not an invasion of privacy, per se, but rather the awareness that our words and actions have consequences. On Myspace, the veil of secrecy is lifted, and one must accept that their profile is accessible to those who seek it out. It is a trade-off: the freedom to express oneself online in exchange for the exposure that comes with it. The burden of responsibility falls upon the individual to navigate these boundaries, to discern what is wise to share and what is best kept hidden.\n\nAnd yet, the prospect of someone scouring the depths of the internet, searching for any sign of malfeasance, raises its own set of questions. Can we entrust the task of surveillance to an individual, tasked with the duty of parsing the intentions of their peers? Or does this become an exercise in paternalism, where the authorities seek to control the thoughts and actions of the young? The line between protection and intrusion is a fine one, and the consequences of crossing it are far-reaching.\n\nI, for one, am cautious in my online interactions. I have a Facebook profile, a digital persona that I present to the world. But I am aware that even the most seemingly innocuous information can be wielded as a tool. A screen name, a photo, a post – all these can be used to unlock the door to my inner world. It is a delicate balance, one that I strive to maintain, but one that is ever-shifting.\n\nThe story of the man who exploited a girl's vulnerability on the internet haunts me still. It is a stark reminder of the darker aspects of human nature, and the ease with which they can be unleashed. And yet, it also speaks to the power of the internet, a force both liberating and terrifying.\n\nIn the end, the issue remains a complex one, with no easy answers. The school's decision to ban Myspace was seen as an overreach, a restriction on the freedom to express oneself. But was it not a necessary measure, a means of protecting the vulnerable? The truth lies in the gray areas, where the boundaries between right and wrong are constantly shifting. It is a terrain that we must navigate with care, ever mindful of the consequences of our actions.",
            "The weight of war hangs heavy over us, a specter of regret that clings to every decision, every action, every thought. The Iraq War, a calamity born of hubris and miscalculation, a disaster that has left scarred landscapes and shattered lives in its wake. I speak of it now, a reluctant participant in a chorus of condemnation, a voice joining the tide of dissent that has grown to a deafening roar.\n\nThe numbers tell the tale: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, including the Iraqi people themselves, believe the war to be a grave mistake. The soldiers who fight, the civilians who suffer, all concur: the war was a folly, a catastrophic misstep that has brought only chaos and despair. And yet, like quicksand, the war's pull is relentless, drawing us deeper into a quagmire of our own making.\n\nThe fault lines run deep, a chasm between our culture and that of the Middle East, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the clumsy hand of colonialism or the simplistic promise of democracy. We sought to impose our will on a people, to bring order to a land torn asunder by conflict and division. But the people of Iraq have spoken, their voices a cacophony of disapproval, their message clear: leave us be, leave us to our own devices, to our own destiny.\n\nAnd yet, we remain, like an unwelcome guest, a presence that is resented and resented. The administration's promises, its justifications, its flimsy rationales for continued occupation are thin gruel indeed. We have heard them all before, the arguments for staying the course, for seeing it through to the bitter end. But I have yet to hear a compelling reason why we should prolong this farce, this charade of occupation and occupation's promises.\n\nEighty percent of Iraqis demand our departure, and yet we cling to our convictions, our ideologies, our notions of what is best for them. We are the outsiders, the interlopers, and they are the ones who know their land, their culture, their lives best. Perhaps it is time to listen to their voices, to heed their cries for departure. For in their words, we might find a glimmer of hope, a chance to redeem ourselves, to extricate ourselves from this quagmire of our own making.\n\nBut no, we will not leave, will not extricate ourselves from this entanglement. We will continue to occupy, to meddle, to impose our will on a people who do not want us. And so the war will drag on, a tired, tattered, and defeated thing, a monument to our folly, our arrogance, our inability to listen, to understand, to learn.",
            "The specter of gender bias still lingers in the United States, a cancer that gnaws at the very fabric of our society.  It is not solely a women's issue, for it is tied to the specific realm of work one inhabits.  In the hallowed halls of business, the glass ceiling still bars the way to advancement for women, who toil beneath the weight of expectation that they shall never supplant their male counterparts.  A legacy of patriarchal thinking, forged over centuries, has convinced many that women are not suited to positions of authority.  And so they are relegated to the lower rungs, despite their qualifications, as the powerful remain entrenched in their seats of power.\n\nBut the phenomenon is not unique to women; men too are subject to the whims of societal expectation.  A man who chooses to stay at home and care for his children is viewed with suspicion, his masculinity called into question.  The notion that a man should be the sole breadwinner has been ingrained in us for so long that any deviation from this norm is met with scorn.  And so the stay-at-home father is forced to endure the slings and arrows of a society that cannot comprehend his choice.\n\nAnd then there is the fashion industry, where men who dare to enter the realm of aesthetics are met with skepticism.  Their masculinity is questioned, their style seen as suspect, as if they are mere imitators of the feminine ideal.  They are, in effect, seen as outsiders, their perspective deemed irrelevant to the world of fashion.\n\nBut change is afoot, slow and halting as it may be.  Women are rising through the ranks, taking on positions of power, and shattering the glass ceiling that once stood in their way.  Men too are beginning to challenge the traditional notion of masculinity, opting to stay at home and care for their children.  And the fashion industry, too, is slowly coming to accept the notion that men can be tastemakers, that their perspective is valuable.\n\nThe key to progress lies not in force, but in subtle persuasion.  By highlighting the qualities of those who have been marginalized, we can begin to chip away at the edifice of prejudice that holds us back.  And so, we must celebrate the achievements of women in business, and the stay-at-home fathers who defy convention.  We must recognize that intelligence and worth are not tied to grammar or geography, but to character and determination.  For it is only through acceptance and understanding that we can hope to vanquish the specter of bias that haunts us still.",
            "In a world where the boundaries of morality are constantly shifting, one can't help but ponder the implications of a changing landscape. The once-thought-profound line between right and wrong has been muddled, as the notion of marijuana's legality has been altered, its status downgraded from a felony to a mere citation. It is a curious thing, this decriminalization, a move that seeks to absolve the petty offenses of the past, and redirect the focus towards more pressing concerns.\n\nBut make no mistake, the reverberations of such a change still linger. The specter of a marijuana charge still haunts the dreams of the young and the old alike, its presence a constant reminder of the precarious nature of societal expectations. The specter of a public defender, a judge, and the dim prospects of a future weighed down by the burden of a conviction – these are the shadows that dance upon the walls of a society still grappling with the implications of a changing tide.\n\nAnd yet, the weight of logic dictates that such a shift be considered. For the costs of arrest, of prosecution, of housing and of the countless other expenses that accompany the machinery of law enforcement are a heavy burden to bear. In municipalities struggling to stay afloat, the notion of decriminalization takes on a new light – a financial reprieve, a chance to redirect resources towards more pressing concerns.\n\nBut it is not merely a matter of economics that drives this conversation. It is the deeper, more primal fears of a society that still grapples with the notion of a substance that exists in a gray area, neither quite fully accepted nor fully rejected. The image of a world where marijuana is as ubiquitous as cigarettes, where its use is normalized, is a prospect both tantalizing and repellent. It is a world where the boundaries between right and wrong are further blurred, where the very notion of moral certitude is called into question.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of moderation, of individual character. For just as the effects of marijuana can vary from person to person, so too can the effects of its legalization. Some will find a world where the substance is normalized to be a liberating force, a chance to explore the depths of their own humanity. Others will find it a corrupting influence, a slippery slope that leads down a path of degradation and despair. The truth, as it often is, lies somewhere in between.",
            "The traditions of the Catholic Church are a weighty burden, a legacy of time-honored practices that have been observed with unyielding fervor.  For generations, they have remained steadfast, unmoving, as the world around them shifts and evolves.  It is a virtue to be rooted in the ancient ways, to cling to the certainties of the past, but it is also a vice to be inflexible, to refuse the gentle whispers of change.\n\nThe Church's doctrine is a labyrinth of contradictions, a maze of absolutes that often defy the ideals it purports to uphold.  The command to love one's neighbor, to accept and forgive, is a notion that is as old as the Church itself, yet it is often lost in the fervor of righteousness that drives its adherents.  The exclusivity of its traditions, the rigid adherence to a narrow set of dogma, is a stark contrast to the very principles it claims to hold dear.\n\nI was raised in a household where the tensions between faith and family were palpable.  My parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, found themselves at odds over the most fundamental aspects of their relationship.  The Church's refusal to recognize their union, to bless their love, was a harsh reminder of the intolerance that lies at the heart of its doctrine.  It is a hypocrisy that is as old as the Church itself, a paradox that has been perpetuated for centuries.\n\nThe issue of priestly marriage is a symptom of this larger problem, a microcosm of the Church's inability to reconcile its ideals with its practices.  Some argue that allowing priests to marry would be a step towards reform, a way to humanize the institution and bring it closer to the people.  Others claim that it would only serve to embolden the worst excesses of its ministers, to legitimize the very behaviors that have come to define the Church's darkest hours.  The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between.\n\nThe pedophiles who prey on the innocent do not need the privilege of marriage to indulge their depravities.  Their crimes are a product of a far deeper sickness, one that cannot be cured by simple changes in policy.  The issue is not one of marriage or celibacy, but of the very fabric of the Church itself.  Its failures are not the result of its traditions, but of its refusal to confront its own darkness.",
            "The proposition weighs heavily on my mind, a maelstrom of conflicting sentiments and treacherous terrain.  To take a stance, to declare one side right and the other wrong, would be to invite the very discord that we seek to avoid. And yet, the issue at hand is a labyrinth of tangled threads, each one knotted around the central problem: the delicate balance between the church and the state. Marriage, that most intimate of unions, lies at the heart of the matter, a sacrament to some, a civil arrangement to others.\n\nI am unsure, lost in the wilderness of this debate, whether marriage should be defined by the government's hand or left to the whims of the church. The notion of a civil union seems a more fitting description, a bond between two people, free from the encumbrance of state interference. After all, what is marriage, but a union of two souls, unencumbered by the trappings of the law?\n\nThe issue of gay marriage, in particular, has become a contentious point, a flashpoint in the ongoing struggle for equality. But is it truly a matter worthy of constitutional amendment? I think not. The Constitution is a document crafted to safeguard the fundamental rights of all citizens, not to codify the prejudices of a select few.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of proportion. Is the issue of gay marriage significant enough to warrant the altering of the foundational document of our nation? I think not. It is a matter of personal conviction, not a cornerstone of our republic. Leave it to the states to decide, and let the people of this great nation settle the matter as they see fit.",
            "In the stark, unforgiving light of day, I find myself grappling with the complexities of a notion that has been etched into the fabric of our society - the notion of homosexuality. Raised in a household bound by the tenets of Christianity, I have come to regard this subject as a twilight realm, a gray area where the certainties of right and wrong blur like the horizon at dawn.\n\nThe friendships I have forged with individuals who identify as homosexual have left an indelible mark on my perspective, and while I may not fully concur with their lifestyle, I believe that the issue of legalization should be resolved by the very ones it affects most - the people of each state. It is a matter of local governance, not a dictate from the federal throne.\n\nAs the bastions of democracy and republicanism stand in stark relief across the American landscape, it is only natural that varying opinions on the matter would prevail. Democratic states, with their emphasis on individual freedom, would likely champion the cause of gay marriage, while their Republican counterparts might stand opposed. Yet, in a land where the right to choose one's domicile is a fundamental tenet, it is incumbent upon those who reside within a particular state to respect the will of its people.\n\nI do not believe that the President, no matter his office or title, should impose his will upon the nation. Such a decision would be an affront to the principles of local autonomy and the sacred trust that resides within each state's borders. The people of a state, having chosen to reside there, should be the ones to decide the course of their own affairs.\n\nThe ephemeral nature of presidential tenure - a span of mere years, a fleeting moment in the annals of time - only serves to underscore the impermanence of such edicts. A president's decision, like the wind that rustles through the trees, is transitory, subject to reversal by the whims of his successor. The people, on the other hand, remain, their will and their resolve a constant presence, a testament to the enduring power of local governance.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the President to dictate the terms of our society, but for the people of each state to chart their own course. Only in this way can we truly say that we are governed by the will of the people, not the fiat of a distant authority.",
            "The public nature of Myspace is a hard truth, a reflection of the world's gaze upon us all. It is a realm where the veil of privacy is thin, where the words we speak can be heard by any who would listen. When a student posts on Myspace, they must consider the consequences of their words, for they are not speaking in a vacuum, but in a space where the eyes of strangers and authorities alike may fall upon them.\n\nThe school officials, in their duty to ensure the safety of their students, may indeed access such public spaces. It is a responsibility they have, a weighty burden that they must bear. And if, in the course of their duties, they come across a post that hints at a threat, a spark that might ignite a flame of violence, is it not their right to intervene? Is it not their duty to prevent the calamity that might befall their students?\n\nThe notion that they should not snoop, that they should respect the privacy of their students, is a notion that rings hollow in these times. For in a world where the threads of our lives are so intricately woven together, where a careless word or deed can spread like wildfire, is it not the duty of those in authority to be vigilant? To anticipate the potential dangers that lurk in the shadows?\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher, one who spoke of the drills they conducted, the preparations they made for the unthinkable. The lockdowns, the evacuations, the drills to prepare for the worst. It was a reality they faced, a reality that haunted them. And in this context, the actions of the school officials take on a different hue. They were not snooping, they were preparing. They were not invading privacy, they were protecting lives.\n\nThe world is a complex tapestry, woven from threads of light and darkness. And in this tapestry, the actions of the school officials are but a small part. Yet, it is a part that speaks to the greater whole. They acted not out of malice, but out of a desire to protect. And in doing so, they served not just their students, but the greater good.",
            "The war.  A maelstrom of chaos that ravaged our collective soul.  I recall the initial fervor that coursed through me like a raging river, fueled by the searing pain of September eleventh.  The memory of that day still lingers, a festering wound that refuses to heal.  In its aftermath, I was all but consumed by a desire for retribution, for vengeance against those who had wrought such devastation.  The call to arms was loud, a clarion cry that echoed through the land, and I answered, my heart afire with purpose.\n\nBut the further we delved into the abyss, the more I saw the chaos that we sowed.  The seeds of our haste and hubris sprouted forth, bearing bitter fruit that we could not reap.  We charged into the unknown, unprepared and unyielding, our eyes fixed on a horizon that shrouded itself in uncertainty.  And in that void, we lost ourselves, our actions driven by emotion rather than reason.\n\nNow, as I reflect on those halcyon days, I am left with a sense of disillusionment.  The people we sought to free from tyranny remain ensnared in their own cycle of violence, their internal strife a cancer that devours them whole.  And we, with our good intentions and our hubris, only served to fan the flames.  Our presence, a constant reminder of our own vulnerability, has only bred more hatred, more resentment.\n\nThe truth is, we are not the ones to bring order to a land beset by such ancient animosities.  We are not the saviors that we once thought ourselves to be.  Our actions, though well-intentioned, have only served to hasten our own departure, for we cannot stay in a land that is not ours to claim.  And so, we toil, a Sisyphean task, pushing against the tide of history, only to be swept back by the very currents we sought to tame.\n\nIt is a bitter pill to swallow, but one that we must acknowledge: our presence in that land has been a hindrance, a burden that we cannot bear.  We must leave, not for the sake of those we sought to help, but for our own sake.  For in staying, we only perpetuate the cycle of violence, and in leaving, we acknowledge the futility of our endeavor.  It is a hard truth, but one that we must confront, lest we continue to sow the seeds of chaos, and reap a harvest of sorrow."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

Its once unwavering hold on the faithful is beginning to slip, and the reason lies not in the erosion of its doctrine, but in the obstinacy of its convictions. The Church's stance on certain matters – marriage, abortion, birth control – is a relic of a bygone era, one that no longer resonates with a world in flux.\n\nThose who once found solace in the Church's teachings now find themselves at odds with its unyielding views. The world has moved on, leaving the Church to cling to anachronistic dogma that is as alienating as it is unforgiving. The consequences are evident: a dwindling flock, a hemorrhaging of adherents who can no longer reconcile the Church's rigidity with their own evolving values.\n\nThe Church's stance on these issues is not merely a matter of faith, but of exclusion. Those who dare to dissent from its teachings are met with silence, ostracism, or worse. The Church's leaders speak of devotion, of a life given over to God, but what of the human experience? What of love, of family, of the messy, beautiful tapestry of life? The Church's absolute commitment to its doctrine is a sterile, loveless thing, one that threatens to suffocate the very essence of what it means to be human.\n\nThe Church's refusal to adapt, to evolve, is a failing of the highest order. Its rigidity is a barrier, a fortress that stands in the way of growth, of understanding, of compassion. The world is not a static entity, and the Church must learn to bend with it, to accommodate the changing tides of human experience. The alternative is a slow, inexorable decline into irrelevance, a fate that is all but sealed.\n\nThe notion that priests cannot be married, that they must devote themselves to a life of celibacy, is a curious one. Is it not enough that they are devoted to their faith? Must they also surrender their very humanity? The Church's leaders speak of a marriage to God, but what of the marriage to another, to a partner, to children, to the world around them? Is this not a love that is no less profound, no less redemptive?\n\nThe Church's stance on these matters is not a matter of conviction, but of dogma. It is a relic of a bygone era, one that has lost touch with the world. The Church must change, must adapt, or risk being left behind in the dust of history. Its very survival depends on it.",
            "The murk of indecision clings to me like a shroud, as I struggle to articulate my thoughts on this most contentious of issues. A plague of uncertainty afflicts me, a weight that presses down upon my conscience. And yet, I shall attempt to find my voice, to speak out against the injustice that threatens to suffocate the souls of those who dare to be different.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of existence, I do not see the threads of choice that bind the fabric of human sexuality. Rather, I believe that the hue of one's nature is woven into the very fabric of their being, an indelible mark that cannot be altered by the whims of man. To hold another accountable for that which they cannot change is to court cruelty, to wield the sword of oppression against those who are powerless to defend themselves.\n\nA nation that would deny the right to marry to those who are born with a different inclination is a nation that has lost its way. It is a creed of exclusion, a doctrine of condemnation that seeks to impose its will upon the very essence of another's being. I would not have it so.\n\nThe federal government, with its heavy hand, should not interject itself into the most intimate aspects of our lives. The business of love and marriage is not a matter for the state to dictate, but rather a sacred trust between two individuals who have chosen to commit to one another. To mandate otherwise is to invite the specter of oppression, to reduce the rich tapestry of human experience to a narrow, suffocating thread.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the rights of all individuals should be sacred and inviolable. To deny the freedom to love and to marry is to deny our very humanity. We should not be the architects of our fellow man's suffering, but rather the guardians of their dignity.\n\nI shall not mince words. The federal government has no business in the private lives of its citizens, least of all when it comes to the most fundamental aspects of our existence. To do so is to surrender to a cruel and heartless calculus, one that values the whims of the powerful over the inherent worth of the marginalized.\n\nLet us not forget that we are all born with our own unique hue, our own particular shade of being. And it is precisely this uniqueness that makes us human. To deny the rights of those who are different is to deny our own humanity. I would not have it so.",
            "In the twilight of our collective conscience, a question lingers, a shadow cast by the principles of equality and justice. The question: should gay marriage be sanctioned by the law. My answer is simple, yet fraught with complexity. There is no reason, no justification, to deny the union of two consenting adults their right to wed.\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional nuclear family is a notion born of ignorance and fear. It is a coin with two sides, yet somehow we've come to believe that one side is tainted, tainted by the very essence of its existence. But this is a falsehood, a lie perpetuated by the darkness that shrouds our understanding of human nature.\n\nThe rights of gay couples are not a separate entity, but an integral part of the fabric of our society. The right to property, the right to healthcare, the right to visit one another in times of need – these are not privileges reserved for the heteronormative. They are fundamental rights, inherent to the human experience.\n\nStudies have shown, time and again, that gay couples are not so different from their straight counterparts. They share the same desires, the same fears, the same hopes. They form relationships that are just as strong, just as resilient, just as loving. And yet, we deny them the one thing that gives meaning to their love – the recognition of their union.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is an affront to religious doctrine is a specious one. The separation of church and state is a fundamental tenet of our democracy. To allow the beliefs of one group to dictate the laws of the land is to undermine the very principles of freedom that we hold dear.\n\nAnd what of the argument that gay couples are somehow less capable of raising children? The evidence suggests otherwise. Children of gay parents are no less well-adjusted, no less happy, than children of straight parents. They are, in fact, no different at all. And as for adoption, it is a decision made by individuals, not by the state.\n\nThe federal government has a duty to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation. To deny gay marriage is to deny the fundamental humanity of a segment of our population. It is a travesty, a mockery of the very ideals that we claim to hold dear.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of morality, but of justice. It is not a question of what some people believe, but of what is right. And what is right is that gay couples should be free to marry, to love, and to live their lives as they see fit, free from the shackles of oppression and fear.",
            "The notion that a substance's legality determines its utility is a notion I find...perplexing. In my experience, working at a hospital pharmacy, I've witnessed firsthand the benefits of certain...forbidden substances. Oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, though classified as controlled substances, are often administered to alleviate suffering. Their efficacy in treating pain and discomfort cannot be denied. Why, then, should we not consider the potential benefits of another substance, one whose only crime is its taboo status?\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is a valid one, but it's a false equivalency. Alcohol, like a raging fire, can consume and destroy. Marijuana, on the other hand, is a more subtle force, one that can be harnessed and controlled. It's a matter of perspective, I suppose. The more we stigmatize a substance, the more we drive people to abuse it. Conversely, by acknowledging its potential, we might encourage responsible use.\n\nThe image of marijuana as a destructive force is a distorted one, born of misinformation and fear. It's not a poison, not a plague. In moderation, it can be a salve, a balm for the afflicted. By shedding the shadows of taboo, we might uncover its true nature, and perhaps, in doing so, we'll find that it's not the devil's brew we've been led to believe, but a tool, like any other, waiting to be wielded wisely.\n\nThe path forward is not a simple one. Gradual, incremental steps might be necessary to ease the transition from prohibition to acceptance. But to deny the substance's potential altogether? That seems a shortsighted approach. By acknowledging its benefits, we might just find a way to harness its power, to make it a force for good, rather than a source of fear and shame.",
            "The church, a stalwart institution, has undergone a metamorphosis, its rigors softened by the passage of time. Gone are the days of strict observance, replaced by a more relaxed atmosphere that welcomes the twenty-first century's entropy. I remember Sundays, a ritual that remained constant throughout my youth – a time for dresses that sparkled like newly fallen snow, shoes that shone like polished obsidian, and a purse to match, a trifecta of elegance that seemed to transcend the mundane. But the passage of time has brought with it a changed landscape, one where teenagers now convene for a truncated mass, its duration a mere thirty minutes, a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of the day.\n\nThe faithful, once attired in their finest, now don casual finery, the summers seeing an influx of beachwear, its wearers no doubt fresh from the waves. Families, once punctual, now arrive late, their tardiness a testament to the changing times. The mornings, once a time for reverent attire, now see jeans and khakis supplant the traditional Sunday best. It is a casualization that is both a symptom and a cause of the world's decay.\n\nBut I digress. It is not the changing nature of the church that has brought me to this fork in the road of reflection. No, it is the more grievous issue of the pedophilia that has besmirched the church's good name. The question lingers: could this scourge have been prevented if the church had taken a different course – one that allowed for female priests, or for priests to take wives? I do not think so. For it is not the institution that creates the monster, but the individual, their predilections forged in the crucible of genetics, not by the strictures of their station. A man, married or unmarried, can still harbor a sick fascination with the young, a sickness that cannot be cured by the sacrament of matrimony.\n\nI recall a conversation with a reverend, a man of the cloth who had chosen a different path, one that allowed him to walk the tightrope of faith and love, to balance the scales of devotion and desire. But even he, in his own words, was not immune to the frailties of human nature. And so, I ask you, what is the relevance of the institution in preventing such horrors? It is not the trappings of power or the strictures of dogma that create the pedophile, but the individual's own darkness, a stain that cannot be washed away by the waters of reform.\n\nIf the church knew of these transgressions and chose to conceal them, then they are guilty of a more grievous sin still – the sin of omission. But I do not think that is the case. I think it is a sickness that has always lurked, hidden from view, its symptoms only now beginning to manifest. And so, I have no further thoughts on the matter, only a sense of sadness and loss, a recognition that the world is a more complicated, more broken place than we would like to admit.",
            "The stench of deceit clung to the premises that led us into Iraq like a shroud. September 11th still seared the nation, its wounds fresh and gaping. The Bush administration seized upon this vulnerability, their words dripping with a fervent conviction that Saddam Hussein was the architect of the atrocity. But this narrative, like a pitiful thread, unraveled all too soon, its fragile fabric revealed for the lie it was. There were no WMDs, no connections to Osama Bin Laden, only a labyrinthine web of deceit spun by those who would stop at nothing to justify their actions.\n\nTheir disregard for the truth was a cancer, eating away at the very fabric of our republic. The memory of Colin Powell's presentation at the UN still lingers, a hollow testament to the ease with which the administration could have deceived even its own stalwarts. The notion that this was an impeachable offense hung in the air, a specter of malfeasance that refused to be vanquished.\n\nThis was a presidency that had never truly grasped the Constitution, its clauses and amendments mere suggestions to be ignored or circumvented at whim. Since 9/11, a façade of patriotism had been erected, a thin veil hiding the true intentions of those who held power. The younger Bush's animus towards Saddam Hussein was a palpable thing, a vendetta born of familial legacy and a desire to expand our dominion over the region. The pursuit of oil, like a dark and insidious force, drove their actions.\n\nBut the war raged on, a tired and faltering thing. The thought of withdrawal was a daunting one, the prospect of civil war and its attendant horrors a grim reality that hung in the balance. The UN's proposed solution, a coalition of neighboring nations to restore order, seemed a tenuous thing, a temporary fix that would only delay the inevitable. Iraq's sovereignty, once a distant concept, now hung precariously in the balance, its dissolution a very real possibility.\n\nThe Parliament, a shell of its former self, limped along, its members at odds with one another. The Prime Minister, a figurehead at best, struggled to exert any meaningful control. The fractious elements that had so long plagued the nation still lingered, their grip on power tenuous but unyielding. It was a maelstrom of competing interests, a chaos that seemed to have no end in sight.\n\nIn this maelstrom, the American people were left to pick up the pieces, their voices muted by the din of war. The stench of deceit still lingered, a reminder of the wounds that would never fully heal. But it was a wound that needed to be opened, to be laid bare for all to see. For it was only then that we might begin to heal, to find our way back to the principles that had once defined us.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A tangled skein of blood and sorrow, of fractured lives and shattered dreams.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of my own thoughts, struggling to grasp the threads of this maddening narrative.  It began as a response, a retaliatory strike against those who had wrought havoc upon our soil.  But now, as the seasons have passed, it has devolved into a futile exercise in futility.\n\nThe nation's resolve, once tempered like steel in the fire of outrage, has grown tarnished and cold.  We speak of building democracy, of spreading freedom's flame to a land beset by darkness, but do we truly comprehend the complexity of this endeavor?  Or are we blinded by our own hubris, our vaunted ideals reduced to a hollow echo of a bygone era?\n\nThe world is a vast and unforgiving expanse, where the boundaries between right and wrong blur like the shifting sands of the desert.  We speak of oil, of resources and power, but do we not forget that we are not the only ones who have a stake in this land?  The people of Iraq, their lives torn asunder by our presence, their children torn from their families, their culture reduced to rubble.\n\nAnd yet, I find myself torn, a leaf blown by the winds of doubt.  Do I wish for peace, for the withdrawal of our troops, or do I cling to the notion that our presence is a necessary evil, a shield against the gathering storm of terrorism?  I think of the families torn apart, the loved ones left behind, and my heart aches with a sense of responsibility, of guilt.\n\nBut then, like a specter from the past, the memory of Vietnam rises, a cautionary tale of the futility of our endeavors.  We speak of building a new nation, of shaping the future in our image, but do we not risk repeating the mistakes of the past, of imposing our will upon a people who desire nothing more than to be left alone?\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions.  The war in Iraq, a labyrinth without a center, a maze with no exit.  And I am but a traveler, lost in the depths of my own uncertainty, searching for a glimmer of hope in a world gone mad.",
            "The notion that a state might presumptuously declare its own sovereignty over the sacred, that it might dictate what is lawful and what is not, strikes a discordant note. The constitution, that venerable document, does indeed enshrine the principle of separation between church and state. It is a distinction that has served as a bulwark against the suffocating weight of dogma, a bulwark that has allowed for the free exercise of faith, unencumbered by the heavy hand of government.\n\nTo tamper with this delicate balance, to seek to impose a particular creed or conviction upon the populace, would be a betrayal of the very spirit that animates our democracy. It would be a willful disregard for the careful craftsmanship of our founding fathers, men who knew that the separation of church and state was the linchpin of our liberty.\n\nThe proponents of this amendment, driven by their own fervent convictions, would have us believe that their way is the only way. But what of those who hold differing views? Shall we not respect the diversity of our faiths, each with its own sacred texts and traditions? The Catholics, the Christians, they are not the only adherents to a higher power. Theirs is but one voice in a cacophony of faiths, each with its own claim to truth.\n\nAnd what of the constitution itself? Shall we not be bound by its words, its clear and unambiguous declaration of the separation of church and state? An amendment, one that would seek to restrict the freedom of conscience, would be a negation of all that we hold dear. It would be a reversal of the very principles that have made our nation great.\n\nThe president's zeal for this amendment, driven as it is by his own personal convictions, betrays a troubling disregard for the pluralism that is the very essence of our democracy. His actions would serve only to enforce the dominance of one faith over others, a dominance that is anathema to the spirit of our constitution. We must not allow this to stand.\n\nThe economy, the society, what of them? Would this amendment truly have a salutary effect? Or would it merely serve to stifle the free exercise of faith, to strangle the diversity that is our greatest strength? I think not. In the end, it is not for the government to dictate what is and is not lawful. It is for the churches, in their wisdom and their deliberation, to speak to the matters of the soul.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict that ravaged the very fabric of that forsaken land, a war that left an indelible stain on the collective conscience of our nation. From the outset, it was clear that the government's motives were shrouded in a veil of deceit. The reasons for our invasion were murky, a tangled web of half-truths and convenient fabrications, designed to exploit the raw emotions of a nation still reeling from the shock of 9/11.\n\nThe parallels between this conflict and the Vietnam War are striking. In both cases, we sought to impose our will upon a foreign land, to remake it in our image, to impose a democracy that we deemed superior to the native governance. But we forgot the lessons of history, the lessons of the long and bloody struggle to establish our own democracy. We forgot that freedom is not a gift to be bestowed, but a hard-won right, earned through the blood and sacrifice of countless souls.\n\nThe aftermath of our invasion was a perfect storm of chaos and destruction. We removed the existing government, leaving a power vacuum that our own government was ill-prepared to fill. The Iraqi people, like the Vietnamese before them, were caught in the crossfire, their lives shattered by the violence and terror that we unleashed. And still, we continue to pour our young men and women into the abyss, sacrificing them on the altar of a war that seems to have no end.\n\nThe truth is, we were never truly prepared for the consequences of our actions. We were blinded by our own hubris, our own conviction in the righteousness of our cause. We were convinced that we could remake Iraq in our image, that we could impose our will upon a people who did not want us there. But the people of Iraq are not so easily swayed. They resisted our occupation, and we responded with force, perpetuating a cycle of violence that shows no signs of abating.\n\nAnd at the heart of it all, the oil. The lure of black gold, the promise of wealth and power that drove us to invade a country that posed no threat to us. We spoke of democracy and freedom, but in truth, it was always about control, about access to the resources that sustain our way of life. We justify our actions by pointing to the existence of North Korea, a country with which we have a very different relationship. But the truth is, our motives are not so noble. We are driven by self-interest, by a desire for power and riches that knows no bounds.\n\nAs I look back on this conflict, I am filled with a sense of sadness and regret. I am reminded of the countless lives lost, the families shattered, the communities destroyed. And I am left to wonder, will it ever end? Will we ever find peace in Iraq, or will we continue to perpetuate a cycle of violence that only seems to grow more entrenched with each passing day? I fear that we may never find the answer to these questions, that the war in Iraq will forever be a stain on our collective conscience, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the hubris of a nation that forgets the lessons of history.",
            "The notion of gay marriage, a conundrum that has long plagued the fringes of our society, has been a concern of mine for as long as I can remember. It is a matter of personal preference, a truth that has been borne out by the proliferation of scientific discovery. The evidence mounts, a mountain of proof that inclines towards the notion that one's orientation is inextricably tied to the intricate dance of biology, rather than the capricious whims of societal conditioning.\n\nTo deny individuals the right to marry, to love, and to build a life together based on something as ephemeral as societal expectation seems a cruel and inhumane proposition. It is a concept that reeks of a paternalistic impulse, a desire to impose one's will upon another, to dictate the terms of their existence.\n\nIn my hometown, I have witnessed firsthand the quiet dignity of couples, their love and commitment to one another unwavering, despite the weight of societal disapproval. They walk among us, unassuming and unremarkable, their love a testament to the power of the human heart. And yet, they are denied the simple right to formalize their union, to have their love recognized and sanctified by the state.\n\nThe notion that the President or any branch of government should presume to define the meaning of marriage, to impose their will upon the hearts of others, is a notion that strikes me as laughable. Marriage is a personal, private affair, a bond between two individuals that should not be subject to the whims of politics or the ambitions of those in power.\n\nI have read and studied the research, the scientific findings that suggest that one's orientation may be determined by biology, rather than upbringing or environment. The evidence is compelling, a accumulation of facts that point to a truth that is both astonishing and liberating.\n\nUltimately, the issue of gay marriage is a matter of equality, of simple human decency. It is a question of whether we, as a society, are willing to recognize the humanity of all individuals, to treat them with the respect and dignity they deserve. Or, whether we shall continue to impose our will upon them, to dictate the terms of their existence, and to deny them the simple right to love and be loved in return.",
            "The abyss of the internet stretches out before us, a void that swallows all we hold dear. When we cast our thoughts and words into its expanse, they become the property of the world, subject to the whims of those who dare to gaze upon them. And if we speak of things that unsettle the air, of malice or of violence, the whispers of others will take on a life of their own. The school officials, bound by duty to safeguard their charges, must tread this perilous ground with care. They are not merely passive witnesses to our digital footprints; they are the first line of defense against the darkness that seethes beneath the surface.\n\nThe internet, a great and unforgiving expanse, holds no sanctuaries from prying eyes. What we post, we post for the world to see. The bulletin boards of Myspace and Facebook, the whispered confessions of LiveJournal entries, all lie exposed to the gaze of those who would seek to do us harm. And when the warning signs are sounded, the officials must act, lest the threads of fate be snarled beyond redemption.\n\nBut how are we to discern the truth from the jest, the sincerity from the guile? The lines blur and the distinctions grow faint. A sociology experiment gone awry, a prank taken too far, or a genuine cry for help – which is it? The uncertainty gnaws at us, a constant reminder that our words have consequences we cannot fully comprehend.\n\nThe case at hand is a stark reminder of this fact. A careless phrase, meant as a jest, became a catalyst for concern. The consequences of our actions, the trail of breadcrumbs we leave behind, can lead us down a path from which we cannot turn back. The officials, bound by duty, must navigate this labyrinth with caution, lest they unravel the very fabric of trust that holds our community together.\n\nAnd yet, we would do well to remember that this is a two-way street. If we seek to shield ourselves from the prying eyes of others, we must be mindful of the doors we open, the keys we hand to those who would seek to know our secrets. The school officials, though well-intentioned, must be mindful of the boundaries they cross, lest they trespass on the territory of the personal.\n\nBut I digress. The fact remains: in this vast and uncaring expanse, our words have power. They can be the spark that sets the flame of chaos ablaze, or the whispered secret that saves a life. We would do well to remember this, and to wield our words with the care and respect they deserve.",
            "The war has dragged on, a desiccated husk of its former purpose. Once, a spark of idealism had driven us, a flame of democracy flickering in the darkness. But time has worn it down, a slow erosion of ideals, a gradual surrender to the void. We began with a righteous intent - to bring freedom to a land oppressed, to plant the seeds of liberty in a soil long barren.\n\nBut the seasons have passed, and the landscape has shifted. Our purpose has been lost to the sands, buried beneath the weight of our own hubris. We sought to prove our strength, to assert our dominance over a world we do not fully comprehend. The ghosts of George Bush's father still linger, whispers of a vendetta long past. The original spark, that flame of democracy, was suffocated by the weight of personal agendas.\n\nWe accomplished what we set out to do in the early days, a statement made in blood and fire. But the war has dragged on, a morass of unyielding conflict. Years have passed, and still we linger, a people drained of purpose. Our economy bleeds, a slow hemorrhage of dollars spent on a cause long since lost. Our own wounds, the poverty and decay that gnaws at our own doorstep, go unattended. We squander what little we have on a war that has become a mere exercise in futility.\n\nBillions of dollars are spent, a river of gold flowing into the void. But what of the roads that crumble, the schools that falter, the healthcare that withers? We have our own wars to fight, our own demons to slay. And yet we pour our treasure into a foreign land, a senseless slaughter of our own sons and daughters. The cause is lost, the war a mere charnel house of our own making.",
            "The notion that a life was saved due to someone's prying gaze on the internet weighs heavy on my mind. It brings forth a question: in a world where the boundaries between private and public are blurred, do we have any expectation of solitude? The internet, a vast expanse of information, swallows all that we choose to share. Myspace, a platform where one's innermost thoughts and desires are laid bare, invites the gaze of the unknown. By posting one's profile, a person surrenders a measure of control, acquiescing to the notion that others may scrutinize their every thought.\n\nThis is not an invasion of privacy, per se, but rather the awareness that our words and actions have consequences. On Myspace, the veil of secrecy is lifted, and one must accept that their profile is accessible to those who seek it out. It is a trade-off: the freedom to express oneself online in exchange for the exposure that comes with it. The burden of responsibility falls upon the individual to navigate these boundaries, to discern what is wise to share and what is best kept hidden.\n\nAnd yet, the prospect of someone scouring the depths of the internet, searching for any sign of malfeasance, raises its own set of questions. Can we entrust the task of surveillance to an individual, tasked with the duty of parsing the intentions of their peers? Or does this become an exercise in paternalism, where the authorities seek to control the thoughts and actions of the young? The line between protection and intrusion is a fine one, and the consequences of crossing it are far-reaching.\n\nI, for one, am cautious in my online interactions. I have a Facebook profile, a digital persona that I present to the world. But I am aware that even the most seemingly innocuous information can be wielded as a tool. A screen name, a photo, a post – all these can be used to unlock the door to my inner world. It is a delicate balance, one that I strive to maintain, but one that is ever-shifting.\n\nThe story of the man who exploited a girl's vulnerability on the internet haunts me still. It is a stark reminder of the darker aspects of human nature, and the ease with which they can be unleashed. And yet, it also speaks to the power of the internet, a force both liberating and terrifying.\n\nIn the end, the issue remains a complex one, with no easy answers. The school's decision to ban Myspace was seen as an overreach, a restriction on the freedom to express oneself. But was it not a necessary measure, a means of protecting the vulnerable? The truth lies in the gray areas, where the boundaries between right and wrong are constantly shifting. It is a terrain that we must navigate with care, ever mindful of the consequences of our actions.",
            "The weight of war hangs heavy over us, a specter of regret that clings to every decision, every action, every thought. The Iraq War, a calamity born of hubris and miscalculation, a disaster that has left scarred landscapes and shattered lives in its wake. I speak of it now, a reluctant participant in a chorus of condemnation, a voice joining the tide of dissent that has grown to a deafening roar.\n\nThe numbers tell the tale: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, including the Iraqi people themselves, believe the war to be a grave mistake. The soldiers who fight, the civilians who suffer, all concur: the war was a folly, a catastrophic misstep that has brought only chaos and despair. And yet, like quicksand, the war's pull is relentless, drawing us deeper into a quagmire of our own making.\n\nThe fault lines run deep, a chasm between our culture and that of the Middle East, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the clumsy hand of colonialism or the simplistic promise of democracy. We sought to impose our will on a people, to bring order to a land torn asunder by conflict and division. But the people of Iraq have spoken, their voices a cacophony of disapproval, their message clear: leave us be, leave us to our own devices, to our own destiny.\n\nAnd yet, we remain, like an unwelcome guest, a presence that is resented and resented. The administration's promises, its justifications, its flimsy rationales for continued occupation are thin gruel indeed. We have heard them all before, the arguments for staying the course, for seeing it through to the bitter end. But I have yet to hear a compelling reason why we should prolong this farce, this charade of occupation and occupation's promises.\n\nEighty percent of Iraqis demand our departure, and yet we cling to our convictions, our ideologies, our notions of what is best for them. We are the outsiders, the interlopers, and they are the ones who know their land, their culture, their lives best. Perhaps it is time to listen to their voices, to heed their cries for departure. For in their words, we might find a glimmer of hope, a chance to redeem ourselves, to extricate ourselves from this quagmire of our own making.\n\nBut no, we will not leave, will not extricate ourselves from this entanglement. We will continue to occupy, to meddle, to impose our will on a people who do not want us. And so the war will drag on, a tired, tattered, and defeated thing, a monument to our folly, our arrogance, our inability to listen, to understand, to learn.",
            "The specter of gender bias still lingers in the United States, a cancer that gnaws at the very fabric of our society.  It is not solely a women's issue, for it is tied to the specific realm of work one inhabits.  In the hallowed halls of business, the glass ceiling still bars the way to advancement for women, who toil beneath the weight of expectation that they shall never supplant their male counterparts.  A legacy of patriarchal thinking, forged over centuries, has convinced many that women are not suited to positions of authority.  And so they are relegated to the lower rungs, despite their qualifications, as the powerful remain entrenched in their seats of power.\n\nBut the phenomenon is not unique to women; men too are subject to the whims of societal expectation.  A man who chooses to stay at home and care for his children is viewed with suspicion, his masculinity called into question.  The notion that a man should be the sole breadwinner has been ingrained in us for so long that any deviation from this norm is met with scorn.  And so the stay-at-home father is forced to endure the slings and arrows of a society that cannot comprehend his choice.\n\nAnd then there is the fashion industry, where men who dare to enter the realm of aesthetics are met with skepticism.  Their masculinity is questioned, their style seen as suspect, as if they are mere imitators of the feminine ideal.  They are, in effect, seen as outsiders, their perspective deemed irrelevant to the world of fashion.\n\nBut change is afoot, slow and halting as it may be.  Women are rising through the ranks, taking on positions of power, and shattering the glass ceiling that once stood in their way.  Men too are beginning to challenge the traditional notion of masculinity, opting to stay at home and care for their children.  And the fashion industry, too, is slowly coming to accept the notion that men can be tastemakers, that their perspective is valuable.\n\nThe key to progress lies not in force, but in subtle persuasion.  By highlighting the qualities of those who have been marginalized, we can begin to chip away at the edifice of prejudice that holds us back.  And so, we must celebrate the achievements of women in business, and the stay-at-home fathers who defy convention.  We must recognize that intelligence and worth are not tied to grammar or geography, but to character and determination.  For it is only through acceptance and understanding that we can hope to vanquish the specter of bias that haunts us still.",
            "In a world where the boundaries of morality are constantly shifting, one can't help but ponder the implications of a changing landscape. The once-thought-profound line between right and wrong has been muddled, as the notion of marijuana's legality has been altered, its status downgraded from a felony to a mere citation. It is a curious thing, this decriminalization, a move that seeks to absolve the petty offenses of the past, and redirect the focus towards more pressing concerns.\n\nBut make no mistake, the reverberations of such a change still linger. The specter of a marijuana charge still haunts the dreams of the young and the old alike, its presence a constant reminder of the precarious nature of societal expectations. The specter of a public defender, a judge, and the dim prospects of a future weighed down by the burden of a conviction – these are the shadows that dance upon the walls of a society still grappling with the implications of a changing tide.\n\nAnd yet, the weight of logic dictates that such a shift be considered. For the costs of arrest, of prosecution, of housing and of the countless other expenses that accompany the machinery of law enforcement are a heavy burden to bear. In municipalities struggling to stay afloat, the notion of decriminalization takes on a new light – a financial reprieve, a chance to redirect resources towards more pressing concerns.\n\nBut it is not merely a matter of economics that drives this conversation. It is the deeper, more primal fears of a society that still grapples with the notion of a substance that exists in a gray area, neither quite fully accepted nor fully rejected. The image of a world where marijuana is as ubiquitous as cigarettes, where its use is normalized, is a prospect both tantalizing and repellent. It is a world where the boundaries between right and wrong are further blurred, where the very notion of moral certitude is called into question.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of moderation, of individual character. For just as the effects of marijuana can vary from person to person, so too can the effects of its legalization. Some will find a world where the substance is normalized to be a liberating force, a chance to explore the depths of their own humanity. Others will find it a corrupting influence, a slippery slope that leads down a path of degradation and despair. The truth, as it often is, lies somewhere in between.",
            "The traditions of the Catholic Church are a weighty burden, a legacy of time-honored practices that have been observed with unyielding fervor.  For generations, they have remained steadfast, unmoving, as the world around them shifts and evolves.  It is a virtue to be rooted in the ancient ways, to cling to the certainties of the past, but it is also a vice to be inflexible, to refuse the gentle whispers of change.\n\nThe Church's doctrine is a labyrinth of contradictions, a maze of absolutes that often defy the ideals it purports to uphold.  The command to love one's neighbor, to accept and forgive, is a notion that is as old as the Church itself, yet it is often lost in the fervor of righteousness that drives its adherents.  The exclusivity of its traditions, the rigid adherence to a narrow set of dogma, is a stark contrast to the very principles it claims to hold dear.\n\nI was raised in a household where the tensions between faith and family were palpable.  My parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, found themselves at odds over the most fundamental aspects of their relationship.  The Church's refusal to recognize their union, to bless their love, was a harsh reminder of the intolerance that lies at the heart of its doctrine.  It is a hypocrisy that is as old as the Church itself, a paradox that has been perpetuated for centuries.\n\nThe issue of priestly marriage is a symptom of this larger problem, a microcosm of the Church's inability to reconcile its ideals with its practices.  Some argue that allowing priests to marry would be a step towards reform, a way to humanize the institution and bring it closer to the people.  Others claim that it would only serve to embolden the worst excesses of its ministers, to legitimize the very behaviors that have come to define the Church's darkest hours.  The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between.\n\nThe pedophiles who prey on the innocent do not need the privilege of marriage to indulge their depravities.  Their crimes are a product of a far deeper sickness, one that cannot be cured by simple changes in policy.  The issue is not one of marriage or celibacy, but of the very fabric of the Church itself.  Its failures are not the result of its traditions, but of its refusal to confront its own darkness.",
            "The proposition weighs heavily on my mind, a maelstrom of conflicting sentiments and treacherous terrain.  To take a stance, to declare one side right and the other wrong, would be to invite the very discord that we seek to avoid. And yet, the issue at hand is a labyrinth of tangled threads, each one knotted around the central problem: the delicate balance between the church and the state. Marriage, that most intimate of unions, lies at the heart of the matter, a sacrament to some, a civil arrangement to others.\n\nI am unsure, lost in the wilderness of this debate, whether marriage should be defined by the government's hand or left to the whims of the church. The notion of a civil union seems a more fitting description, a bond between two people, free from the encumbrance of state interference. After all, what is marriage, but a union of two souls, unencumbered by the trappings of the law?\n\nThe issue of gay marriage, in particular, has become a contentious point, a flashpoint in the ongoing struggle for equality. But is it truly a matter worthy of constitutional amendment? I think not. The Constitution is a document crafted to safeguard the fundamental rights of all citizens, not to codify the prejudices of a select few.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of proportion. Is the issue of gay marriage significant enough to warrant the altering of the foundational document of our nation? I think not. It is a matter of personal conviction, not a cornerstone of our republic. Leave it to the states to decide, and let the people of this great nation settle the matter as they see fit.",
            "In the stark, unforgiving light of day, I find myself grappling with the complexities of a notion that has been etched into the fabric of our society - the notion of homosexuality. Raised in a household bound by the tenets of Christianity, I have come to regard this subject as a twilight realm, a gray area where the certainties of right and wrong blur like the horizon at dawn.\n\nThe friendships I have forged with individuals who identify as homosexual have left an indelible mark on my perspective, and while I may not fully concur with their lifestyle, I believe that the issue of legalization should be resolved by the very ones it affects most - the people of each state. It is a matter of local governance, not a dictate from the federal throne.\n\nAs the bastions of democracy and republicanism stand in stark relief across the American landscape, it is only natural that varying opinions on the matter would prevail. Democratic states, with their emphasis on individual freedom, would likely champion the cause of gay marriage, while their Republican counterparts might stand opposed. Yet, in a land where the right to choose one's domicile is a fundamental tenet, it is incumbent upon those who reside within a particular state to respect the will of its people.\n\nI do not believe that the President, no matter his office or title, should impose his will upon the nation. Such a decision would be an affront to the principles of local autonomy and the sacred trust that resides within each state's borders. The people of a state, having chosen to reside there, should be the ones to decide the course of their own affairs.\n\nThe ephemeral nature of presidential tenure - a span of mere years, a fleeting moment in the annals of time - only serves to underscore the impermanence of such edicts. A president's decision, like the wind that rustles through the trees, is transitory, subject to reversal by the whims of his successor. The people, on the other hand, remain, their will and their resolve a constant presence, a testament to the enduring power of local governance.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the President to dictate the terms of our society, but for the people of each state to chart their own course. Only in this way can we truly say that we are governed by the will of the people, not the fiat of a distant authority.",
            "The public nature of Myspace is a hard truth, a reflection of the world's gaze upon us all. It is a realm where the veil of privacy is thin, where the words we speak can be heard by any who would listen. When a student posts on Myspace, they must consider the consequences of their words, for they are not speaking in a vacuum, but in a space where the eyes of strangers and authorities alike may fall upon them.\n\nThe school officials, in their duty to ensure the safety of their students, may indeed access such public spaces. It is a responsibility they have, a weighty burden that they must bear. And if, in the course of their duties, they come across a post that hints at a threat, a spark that might ignite a flame of violence, is it not their right to intervene? Is it not their duty to prevent the calamity that might befall their students?\n\nThe notion that they should not snoop, that they should respect the privacy of their students, is a notion that rings hollow in these times. For in a world where the threads of our lives are so intricately woven together, where a careless word or deed can spread like wildfire, is it not the duty of those in authority to be vigilant? To anticipate the potential dangers that lurk in the shadows?\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher, one who spoke of the drills they conducted, the preparations they made for the unthinkable. The lockdowns, the evacuations, the drills to prepare for the worst. It was a reality they faced, a reality that haunted them. And in this context, the actions of the school officials take on a different hue. They were not snooping, they were preparing. They were not invading privacy, they were protecting lives.\n\nThe world is a complex tapestry, woven from threads of light and darkness. And in this tapestry, the actions of the school officials are but a small part. Yet, it is a part that speaks to the greater whole. They acted not out of malice, but out of a desire to protect. And in doing so, they served not just their students, but the greater good.",
            "The war.  A maelstrom of chaos that ravaged our collective soul.  I recall the initial fervor that coursed through me like a raging river, fueled by the searing pain of September eleventh.  The memory of that day still lingers, a festering wound that refuses to heal.  In its aftermath, I was all but consumed by a desire for retribution, for vengeance against those who had wrought such devastation.  The call to arms was loud, a clarion cry that echoed through the land, and I answered, my heart afire with purpose.\n\nBut the further we delved into the abyss, the more I saw the chaos that we sowed.  The seeds of our haste and hubris sprouted forth, bearing bitter fruit that we could not reap.  We charged into the unknown, unprepared and unyielding, our eyes fixed on a horizon that shrouded itself in uncertainty.  And in that void, we lost ourselves, our actions driven by emotion rather than reason.\n\nNow, as I reflect on those halcyon days, I am left with a sense of disillusionment.  The people we sought to free from tyranny remain ensnared in their own cycle of violence, their internal strife a cancer that devours them whole.  And we, with our good intentions and our hubris, only served to fan the flames.  Our presence, a constant reminder of our own vulnerability, has only bred more hatred, more resentment.\n\nThe truth is, we are not the ones to bring order to a land beset by such ancient animosities.  We are not the saviors that we once thought ourselves to be.  Our actions, though well-intentioned, have only served to hasten our own departure, for we cannot stay in a land that is not ours to claim.  And so, we toil, a Sisyphean task, pushing against the tide of history, only to be swept back by the very currents we sought to tame.\n\nIt is a bitter pill to swallow, but one that we must acknowledge: our presence in that land has been a hindrance, a burden that we cannot bear.  We must leave, not for the sake of those we sought to help, but for our own sake.  For in staying, we only perpetuate the cycle of violence, and in leaving, we acknowledge the futility of our endeavor.  It is a hard truth, but one that we must confront, lest we continue to sow the seeds of chaos, and reap a harvest of sorrow."
