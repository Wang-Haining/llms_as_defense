            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church stands at a precipice, its edifice weathered by the tempests of time. Its once unwavering hold on the faithful is beginning to slip, and the reason lies not in the erosion of its doctrine, but in the obstinacy of its convictions. The Church's stance on certain matters – marriage, abortion, birth control – is a relic of a bygone era, one that no longer resonates with a world in flux.\n\nThose who once found solace in the Church's teachings now find themselves at odds with its unyielding views. The world has moved on, leaving the Church to cling to anachronistic dogma that is as alienating as it is unforgiving. The consequences are evident: a dwindling flock, a hemorrhaging of adherents who can no longer reconcile the Church's rigidity with their own evolving values.\n\nThe Church's stance on these issues is not merely a matter of faith, but of exclusion. Those who dare to dissent from its teachings are met with silence, ostracism, or worse. The Church's leaders speak of devotion, of a life given over to God, but what of the human experience? What of love, of family, of the messy, beautiful tapestry of life? The Church's absolute commitment to its doctrine is a sterile, loveless thing, one that threatens to suffocate the very essence of what it means to be human.\n\nThe Church's refusal to adapt, to evolve, is a failing of the highest order. Its rigidity is a barrier, a fortress that stands in the way of growth, of understanding, of compassion. The world is not a static entity, and the Church must learn to bend with it, to accommodate the changing tides of human experience. The alternative is a slow, inexorable decline into irrelevance, a fate that is all but sealed.\n\nThe notion that priests cannot be married, that they must devote themselves to a life of celibacy, is a curious one. Is it not enough that they are devoted to their faith? Must they also surrender their very humanity? The Church's leaders speak of a marriage to God, but what of the marriage to another, to a partner, to children, to the world around them? Is this not a love that is no less profound, no less redemptive?\n\nThe Church's stance on these matters is not a matter of conviction, but of dogma. It is a relic of a bygone era, one that has lost touch with the world. The Church must change, must adapt, or risk being left behind in the dust of history. Its very survival depends on it.",
            "The murk of indecision clings to me like a shroud, as I struggle to articulate my thoughts on this most contentious of issues. A plague of uncertainty afflicts me, a weight that presses down upon my conscience. And yet, I shall attempt to find my voice, to speak out against the injustice that threatens to suffocate the souls of those who dare to be different.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of existence, I do not see the threads of choice that bind the fabric of human sexuality. Rather, I believe that the hue of one's nature is woven into the very fabric of their being, an indelible mark that cannot be altered by the whims of man. To hold another accountable for that which they cannot change is to court cruelty, to wield the sword of oppression against those who are powerless to defend themselves.\n\nA nation that would deny the right to marry to those who are born with a different inclination is a nation that has lost its way. It is a creed of exclusion, a doctrine of condemnation that seeks to impose its will upon the very essence of another's being. I would not have it so.\n\nThe federal government, with its heavy hand, should not interject itself into the most intimate aspects of our lives. The business of love and marriage is not a matter for the state to dictate, but rather a sacred trust between two individuals who have chosen to commit to one another. To mandate otherwise is to invite the specter of oppression, to reduce the rich tapestry of human experience to a narrow, suffocating thread.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the rights of all individuals should be sacred and inviolable. To deny the freedom to love and to marry is to deny our very humanity. We should not be the architects of our fellow man's suffering, but rather the guardians of their dignity.\n\nI shall not mince words. The federal government has no business in the private lives of its citizens, least of all when it comes to the most fundamental aspects of our existence. To do so is to surrender to a cruel and heartless calculus, one that values the whims of the powerful over the inherent worth of the marginalized.\n\nLet us not forget that we are all born with our own unique hue, our own particular shade of being. And it is precisely this uniqueness that makes us human. To deny the rights of those who are different is to deny our own humanity. I would not have it so.",
            "In the twilight of our collective conscience, a question lingers, a shadow cast by the principles of equality and justice. The question: should gay marriage be sanctioned by the law. My answer is simple, yet fraught with complexity. There is no reason, no justification, to deny the union of two consenting adults their right to wed.\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional nuclear family is a notion born of ignorance and fear. It is a coin with two sides, yet somehow we've come to believe that one side is tainted, tainted by the very essence of its existence. But this is a falsehood, a lie perpetuated by the darkness that shrouds our understanding of human nature.\n\nThe rights of gay couples are not a separate entity, but an integral part of the fabric of our society. The right to property, the right to healthcare, the right to visit one another in times of need – these are not privileges reserved for the heteronormative. They are fundamental rights, inherent to the human experience.\n\nStudies have shown, time and again, that gay couples are not so different from their straight counterparts. They share the same desires, the same fears, the same hopes. They form relationships that are just as strong, just as resilient, just as loving. And yet, we deny them the one thing that gives meaning to their love – the recognition of their union.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is an affront to religious doctrine is a specious one. The separation of church and state is a fundamental tenet of our democracy. To allow the beliefs of one group to dictate the laws of the land is to undermine the very principles of freedom that we hold dear.\n\nAnd what of the argument that gay couples are somehow less capable of raising children? The evidence suggests otherwise. Children of gay parents are no less well-adjusted, no less happy, than children of straight parents. They are, in fact, no different at all. And as for adoption, it is a decision made by individuals, not by the state.\n\nThe federal government has a duty to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation. To deny gay marriage is to deny the fundamental humanity of a segment of our population. It is a travesty, a mockery of the very ideals that we claim to hold dear.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of morality, but of justice. It is not a question of what some people believe, but of what is right. And what is right is that gay couples should be free to marry, to love, and to live their lives as they see fit, free from the shackles of oppression and fear.",
            "The notion that a substance's legality determines its utility is a notion I find...perplexing. In my experience, working at a hospital pharmacy, I've witnessed firsthand the benefits of certain...forbidden substances. Oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, though classified as controlled substances, are often administered to alleviate suffering. Their efficacy in treating pain and discomfort cannot be denied. Why, then, should we not consider the potential benefits of another substance, one whose only crime is its taboo status?\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is a valid one, but it's a false equivalency. Alcohol, like a raging fire, can consume and destroy. Marijuana, on the other hand, is a more subtle force, one that can be harnessed and controlled. It's a matter of perspective, I suppose. The more we stigmatize a substance, the more we drive people to abuse it. Conversely, by acknowledging its potential, we might encourage responsible use.\n\nThe image of marijuana as a destructive force is a distorted one, born of misinformation and fear. It's not a poison, not a plague. In moderation, it can be a salve, a balm for the afflicted. By shedding the shadows of taboo, we might uncover its true nature, and perhaps, in doing so, we'll find that it's not the devil's brew we've been led to believe, but a tool, like any other, waiting to be wielded wisely.\n\nThe path forward is not a simple one. Gradual, incremental steps might be necessary to ease the transition from prohibition to acceptance. But to deny the substance's potential altogether? That seems a shortsighted approach. By acknowledging its benefits, we might just find a way to harness its power, to make it a force for good, rather than a source of fear and shame.",
            "The church, a stalwart institution, has undergone a metamorphosis, its rigors softened by the passage of time. Gone are the days of strict observance, replaced by a more relaxed atmosphere that welcomes the twenty-first century's entropy. I remember Sundays, a ritual that remained constant throughout my youth – a time for dresses that sparkled like newly fallen snow, shoes that shone like polished obsidian, and a purse to match, a trifecta of elegance that seemed to transcend the mundane. But the passage of time has brought with it a changed landscape, one where teenagers now convene for a truncated mass, its duration a mere thirty minutes, a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of the day.\n\nThe faithful, once attired in their finest, now don casual finery, the summers seeing an influx of beachwear, its wearers no doubt fresh from the waves. Families, once punctual, now arrive late, their tardiness a testament to the changing times. The mornings, once a time for reverent attire, now see jeans and khakis supplant the traditional Sunday best. It is a casualization that is both a symptom and a cause of the world's decay.\n\nBut I digress. It is not the changing nature of the church that has brought me to this fork in the road of reflection. No, it is the more grievous issue of the pedophilia that has besmirched the church's good name. The question lingers: could this scourge have been prevented if the church had taken a different course – one that allowed for female priests, or for priests to take wives? I do not think so. For it is not the institution that creates the monster, but the individual, their predilections forged in the crucible of genetics, not by the strictures of their station. A man, married or unmarried, can still harbor a sick fascination with the young, a sickness that cannot be cured by the sacrament of matrimony.\n\nI recall a conversation with a reverend, a man of the cloth who had chosen a different path, one that allowed him to walk the tightrope of faith and love, to balance the scales of devotion and desire. But even he, in his own words, was not immune to the frailties of human nature. And so, I ask you, what is the relevance of the institution in preventing such horrors? It is not the trappings of power or the strictures of dogma that create the pedophile, but the individual's own darkness, a stain that cannot be washed away by the waters of reform.\n\nIf the church knew of these transgressions and chose to conceal them, then they are guilty of a more grievous sin still – the sin of omission. But I do not think that is the case. I think it is a sickness that has always lurked, hidden from view, its symptoms only now beginning to manifest. And so, I have no further thoughts on the matter, only a sense of sadness and loss, a recognition that the world is a more complicated, more broken place than we would like to admit.",
            "The stench of deceit clung to the premises that led us into Iraq like a shroud. September 11th still seared the nation, its wounds fresh and gaping. The Bush administration seized upon this vulnerability, their words dripping with a fervent conviction that Saddam Hussein was the architect of the atrocity. But this narrative, like a pitiful thread, unraveled all too soon, its fragile fabric revealed for the lie it was. There were no WMDs, no connections to Osama Bin Laden, only a labyrinthine web of deceit spun by those who would stop at nothing to justify their actions.\n\nTheir disregard for the truth was a cancer, eating away at the very fabric of our republic. The memory of Colin Powell's presentation at the UN still lingers, a hollow testament to the ease with which the administration could have deceived even its own stalwarts. The notion that this was an impeachable offense hung in the air, a specter of malfeasance that refused to be vanquished.\n\nThis was a presidency that had never truly grasped the Constitution, its clauses and amendments mere suggestions to be ignored or circumvented at whim. Since 9/11, a façade of patriotism had been erected, a thin veil hiding the true intentions of those who held power. The younger Bush's animus towards Saddam Hussein was a palpable thing, a vendetta born of familial legacy and a desire to expand our dominion over the region. The pursuit of oil, like a dark and insidious force, drove their actions.\n\nBut the war raged on, a tired and faltering thing. The thought of withdrawal was a daunting one, the prospect of civil war and its attendant horrors a grim reality that hung in the balance. The UN's proposed solution, a coalition of neighboring nations to restore order, seemed a tenuous thing, a temporary fix that would only delay the inevitable. Iraq's sovereignty, once a distant concept, now hung precariously in the balance, its dissolution a very real possibility.\n\nThe Parliament, a shell of its former self, limped along, its members at odds with one another. The Prime Minister, a figurehead at best, struggled to exert any meaningful control. The fractious elements that had so long plagued the nation still lingered, their grip on power tenuous but unyielding. It was a maelstrom of competing interests, a chaos that seemed to have no end in sight.\n\nIn this maelstrom, the American people were left to pick up the pieces, their voices muted by the din of war. The stench of deceit still lingered, a reminder of the wounds that would never fully heal. But it was a wound that needed to be opened, to be laid bare for all to see. For it was only then that we might begin to heal, to find our way back to the principles that had once defined us.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A tangled skein of blood and sorrow, of fractured lives and shattered dreams.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of my own thoughts, struggling to grasp the threads of this maddening narrative.  It began as a response, a retaliatory strike against those who had wrought havoc upon our soil.  But now, as the seasons have passed, it has devolved into a futile exercise in futility.\n\nThe nation's resolve, once tempered like steel in the fire of outrage, has grown tarnished and cold.  We speak of building democracy, of spreading freedom's flame to a land beset by darkness, but do we truly comprehend the complexity of this endeavor?  Or are we blinded by our own hubris, our vaunted ideals reduced to a hollow echo of a bygone era?\n\nThe world is a vast and unforgiving expanse, where the boundaries between right and wrong blur like the shifting sands of the desert.  We speak of oil, of resources and power, but do we not forget that we are not the only ones who have a stake in this land?  The people of Iraq, their lives torn asunder by our presence, their children torn from their families, their culture reduced to rubble.\n\nAnd yet, I find myself torn, a leaf blown by the winds of doubt.  Do I wish for peace, for the withdrawal of our troops, or do I cling to the notion that our presence is a necessary evil, a shield against the gathering storm of terrorism?  I think of the families torn apart, the loved ones left behind, and my heart aches with a sense of responsibility, of guilt.\n\nBut then, like a specter from the past, the memory of Vietnam rises, a cautionary tale of the futility of our endeavors.  We speak of building a new nation, of shaping the future in our image, but do we not risk repeating the mistakes of the past, of imposing our will upon a people who desire nothing more than to be left alone?\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions.  The war in Iraq, a labyrinth without a center, a maze with no exit.  And I am but a traveler, lost in the depths of my own uncertainty, searching for a glimmer of hope in a world gone mad.",
            "The notion that a state might presumptuously declare its own sovereignty over the sacred, that it might dictate what is lawful and what is not, strikes a discordant note. The constitution, that venerable document, does indeed enshrine the principle of separation between church and state. It is a distinction that has served as a bulwark against the suffocating weight of dogma, a bulwark that has allowed for the free exercise of faith, unencumbered by the heavy hand of government.\n\nTo tamper with this delicate balance, to seek to impose a particular creed or conviction upon the populace, would be a betrayal of the very spirit that animates our democracy. It would be a willful disregard for the careful craftsmanship of our founding fathers, men who knew that the separation of church and state was the linchpin of our liberty.\n\nThe proponents of this amendment, driven by their own fervent convictions, would have us believe that their way is the only way. But what of those who hold differing views? Shall we not respect the diversity of our faiths, each with its own sacred texts and traditions? The Catholics, the Christians, they are not the only adherents to a higher power. Theirs is but one voice in a cacophony of faiths, each with its own claim to truth.\n\nAnd what of the constitution itself? Shall we not be bound by its words, its clear and unambiguous declaration of the separation of church and state? An amendment, one that would seek to restrict the freedom of conscience, would be a negation of all that we hold dear. It would be a reversal of the very principles that have made our nation great.\n\nThe president's zeal for this amendment, driven as it is by his own personal convictions, betrays a troubling disregard for the pluralism that is the very essence of our democracy. His actions would serve only to enforce the dominance of one faith over others, a dominance that is anathema to the spirit of our constitution. We must not allow this to stand.\n\nThe economy, the society, what of them? Would this amendment truly have a salutary effect? Or would it merely serve to stifle the free exercise of faith, to strangle the diversity that is our greatest strength? I think not. In the end, it is not for the government to dictate what is and is not lawful. It is for the churches, in their wisdom and their deliberation, to speak to the matters of the soul.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict that ravaged the very fabric of that forsaken land, a war that left an indelible stain on the collective conscience of our nation. From the outset, it was clear that the government's motives were shrouded in a veil of deceit. The reasons for our invasion were murky, a tangled web of half-truths and convenient fabrications, designed to exploit the raw emotions of a nation still reeling from the shock of 9/11.\n\nThe parallels between this conflict and the Vietnam War are striking. In both cases, we sought to impose our will upon a foreign land, to remake it in our image, to impose a democracy that we deemed superior to the native governance. But we forgot the lessons of history, the lessons of the long and bloody struggle to establish our own democracy. We forgot that freedom is not a gift to be bestowed, but a hard-won right, earned through the blood and sacrifice of countless souls.\n\nThe aftermath of our invasion was a perfect storm of chaos and destruction. We removed the existing government, leaving a power vacuum that our own government was ill-prepared to fill. The Iraqi people, like the Vietnamese before them, were caught in the crossfire, their lives shattered by the violence and terror that we unleashed. And still, we continue to pour our young men and women into the abyss, sacrificing them on the altar of a war that seems to have no end.\n\nThe truth is, we were never truly prepared for the consequences of our actions. We were blinded by our own hubris, our own conviction in the righteousness of our cause. We were convinced that we could remake Iraq in our image, that we could impose our will upon a people who did not want us there. But the people of Iraq are not so easily swayed. They resisted our occupation, and we responded with force, perpetuating a cycle of violence that shows no signs of abating.\n\nAnd at the heart of it all, the oil. The lure of black gold, the promise of wealth and power that drove us to invade a country that posed no threat to us. We spoke of democracy and freedom, but in truth, it was always about control, about access to the resources that sustain our way of life. We justify our actions by pointing to the existence of North Korea, a country with which we have a very different relationship. But the truth is, our motives are not so noble. We are driven by self-interest, by a desire for power and riches that knows no bounds.\n\nAs I look back on this conflict, I am filled with a sense of sadness and regret. I am reminded of the countless lives lost, the families shattered, the communities destroyed. And I am left to wonder, will it ever end? Will we ever find peace in Iraq, or will we continue to perpetuate a cycle of violence that only seems to grow more entrenched with each passing day? I fear that we may never find the answer to these questions, that the war in Iraq will forever be a stain on our collective conscience, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the hubris of a nation that forgets the lessons of history.",
            "The notion of gay marriage, a conundrum that has long plagued the fringes of our society, has been a concern of mine for as long as I can remember. It is a matter of personal preference, a truth that has been borne out by the proliferation of scientific discovery. The evidence mounts, a mountain of proof that inclines towards the notion that one's orientation is inextricably tied to the intricate dance of biology, rather than the capricious whims of societal conditioning.\n\nTo deny individuals the right to marry, to love, and to build a life together based on something as ephemeral as societal expectation seems a cruel and inhumane proposition. It is a concept that reeks of a paternalistic impulse, a desire to impose one's will upon another, to dictate the terms of their existence.\n\nIn my hometown, I have witnessed firsthand the quiet dignity of couples, their love and commitment to one another unwavering, despite the weight of societal disapproval. They walk among us, unassuming and unremarkable, their love a testament to the power of the human heart. And yet, they are denied the simple right to formalize their union, to have their love recognized and sanctified by the state.\n\nThe notion that the President or any branch of government should presume to define the meaning of marriage, to impose their will upon the hearts of others, is a notion that strikes me as laughable. Marriage is a personal, private affair, a bond between two individuals that should not be subject to the whims of politics or the ambitions of those in power.\n\nI have read and studied the research, the scientific findings that suggest that one's orientation may be determined by biology, rather than upbringing or environment. The evidence is compelling, a accumulation of facts that point to a truth that is both astonishing and liberating.\n\nUltimately, the issue of gay marriage is a matter of equality, of simple human decency. It is a question of whether we, as a society, are willing to recognize the humanity of all individuals, to treat them with the respect and dignity they deserve. Or, whether we shall continue to impose our will upon them, to dictate the terms of their existence, and to deny them the simple right to love and be loved in return.",
            "The abyss of the internet stretches out before us, a void that swallows all we hold dear. When we cast our thoughts and words into its expanse, they become the property of the world, subject to the whims of those who dare to gaze upon them. And if we speak of things that unsettle the air, of malice or of violence, the whispers of others will take on a life of their own. The school officials, bound by duty to safeguard their charges, must tread this perilous ground with care. They are not merely passive witnesses to our digital footprints; they are the first line of defense against the darkness that seethes beneath the surface.\n\nThe internet, a great and unforgiving expanse, holds no sanctuaries from prying eyes. What we post, we post for the world to see. The bulletin boards of Myspace and Facebook, the whispered confessions of LiveJournal entries, all lie exposed to the gaze of those who would seek to do us harm. And when the warning signs are sounded, the officials must act, lest the threads of fate be snarled beyond redemption.\n\nBut how are we to discern the truth from the jest, the sincerity from the guile? The lines blur and the distinctions grow faint. A sociology experiment gone awry, a prank taken too far, or a genuine cry for help – which is it? The uncertainty gnaws at us, a constant reminder that our words have consequences we cannot fully comprehend.\n\nThe case at hand is a stark reminder of this fact. A careless phrase, meant as a jest, became a catalyst for concern. The consequences of our actions, the trail of breadcrumbs we leave behind, can lead us down a path from which we cannot turn back. The officials, bound by duty, must navigate this labyrinth with caution, lest they unravel the very fabric of trust that holds our community together.\n\nAnd yet, we would do well to remember that this is a two-way street. If we seek to shield ourselves from the prying eyes of others, we must be mindful of the doors we open, the keys we hand to those who would seek to know our secrets. The school officials, though well-intentioned, must be mindful of the boundaries they cross, lest they trespass on the territory of the personal.\n\nBut I digress. The fact remains: in this vast and uncaring expanse, our words have power. They can be the spark that sets the flame of chaos ablaze, or the whispered secret that saves a life. We would do well to remember this, and to wield our words with the care and respect they deserve.",
            "The war has dragged on, a desiccated husk of its former purpose. Once, a spark of idealism had driven us, a flame of democracy flickering in the darkness. But time has worn it down, a slow erosion of ideals, a gradual surrender to the void. We began with a righteous intent - to bring freedom to a land oppressed, to plant the seeds of liberty in a soil long barren.\n\nBut the seasons have passed, and the landscape has shifted. Our purpose has been lost to the sands, buried beneath the weight of our own hubris. We sought to prove our strength, to assert our dominance over a world we do not fully comprehend. The ghosts of George Bush's father still linger, whispers of a vendetta long past. The original spark, that flame of democracy, was suffocated by the weight of personal agendas.\n\nWe accomplished what we set out to do in the early days, a statement made in blood and fire. But the war has dragged on, a morass of unyielding conflict. Years have passed, and still we linger, a people drained of purpose. Our economy bleeds, a slow hemorrhage of dollars spent on a cause long since lost. Our own wounds, the poverty and decay that gnaws at our own doorstep, go unattended. We squander what little we have on a war that has become a mere exercise in futility.\n\nBillions of dollars are spent, a river of gold flowing into the void. But what of the roads that crumble, the schools that falter, the healthcare that withers? We have our own wars to fight, our own demons to slay. And yet we pour our treasure into a foreign land, a senseless slaughter of our own sons and daughters. The cause is lost, the war a mere charnel house of our own making.",
            "The notion that a life was saved due to someone's prying gaze on the internet weighs heavy on my mind. It brings forth a question: in a world where the boundaries between private and public are blurred, do we have any expectation of solitude? The internet, a vast expanse of information, swallows all that we choose to share. Myspace, a platform where one's innermost thoughts and desires are laid bare, invites the gaze of the unknown. By posting one's profile, a person surrenders a measure of control, acquiescing to the notion that others may scrutinize their every thought.\n\nThis is not an invasion of privacy, per se, but rather the awareness that our words and actions have consequences. On Myspace, the veil of secrecy is lifted, and one must accept that their profile is accessible to those who seek it out. It is a trade-off: the freedom to express oneself online in exchange for the exposure that comes with it. The burden of responsibility falls upon the individual to navigate these boundaries, to discern what is wise to share and what is best kept hidden.\n\nAnd yet, the prospect of someone scouring the depths of the internet, searching for any sign of malfeasance, raises its own set of questions. Can we entrust the task of surveillance to an individual, tasked with the duty of parsing the intentions of their peers? Or does this become an exercise in paternalism, where the authorities seek to control the thoughts and actions of the young? The line between protection and intrusion is a fine one, and the consequences of crossing it are far-reaching.\n\nI, for one, am cautious in my online interactions. I have a Facebook profile, a digital persona that I present to the world. But I am aware that even the most seemingly innocuous information can be wielded as a tool. A screen name, a photo, a post – all these can be used to unlock the door to my inner world. It is a delicate balance, one that I strive to maintain, but one that is ever-shifting.\n\nThe story of the man who exploited a girl's vulnerability on the internet haunts me still. It is a stark reminder of the darker aspects of human nature, and the ease with which they can be unleashed. And yet, it also speaks to the power of the internet, a force both liberating and terrifying.\n\nIn the end, the issue remains a complex one, with no easy answers. The school's decision to ban Myspace was seen as an overreach, a restriction on the freedom to express oneself. But was it not a necessary measure, a means of protecting the vulnerable? The truth lies in the gray areas, where the boundaries between right and wrong are constantly shifting. It is a terrain that we must navigate with care, ever mindful of the consequences of our actions.",
            "The weight of war hangs heavy over us, a specter of regret that clings to every decision, every action, every thought. The Iraq War, a calamity born of hubris and miscalculation, a disaster that has left scarred landscapes and shattered lives in its wake. I speak of it now, a reluctant participant in a chorus of condemnation, a voice joining the tide of dissent that has grown to a deafening roar.\n\nThe numbers tell the tale: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, including the Iraqi people themselves, believe the war to be a grave mistake. The soldiers who fight, the civilians who suffer, all concur: the war was a folly, a catastrophic misstep that has brought only chaos and despair. And yet, like quicksand, the war's pull is relentless, drawing us deeper into a quagmire of our own making.\n\nThe fault lines run deep, a chasm between our culture and that of the Middle East, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the clumsy hand of colonialism or the simplistic promise of democracy. We sought to impose our will on a people, to bring order to a land torn asunder by conflict and division. But the people of Iraq have spoken, their voices a cacophony of disapproval, their message clear: leave us be, leave us to our own devices, to our own destiny.\n\nAnd yet, we remain, like an unwelcome guest, a presence that is resented and resented. The administration's promises, its justifications, its flimsy rationales for continued occupation are thin gruel indeed. We have heard them all before, the arguments for staying the course, for seeing it through to the bitter end. But I have yet to hear a compelling reason why we should prolong this farce, this charade of occupation and occupation's promises.\n\nEighty percent of Iraqis demand our departure, and yet we cling to our convictions, our ideologies, our notions of what is best for them. We are the outsiders, the interlopers, and they are the ones who know their land, their culture, their lives best. Perhaps it is time to listen to their voices, to heed their cries for departure. For in their words, we might find a glimmer of hope, a chance to redeem ourselves, to extricate ourselves from this quagmire of our own making.\n\nBut no, we will not leave, will not extricate ourselves from this entanglement. We will continue to occupy, to meddle, to impose our will on a people who do not want us. And so the war will drag on, a tired, tattered, and defeated thing, a monument to our folly, our arrogance, our inability to listen, to understand, to learn.",
            "The specter of gender bias still lingers in the United States, a cancer that gnaws at the very fabric of our society.  It is not solely a women's issue, for it is tied to the specific realm of work one inhabits.  In the hallowed halls of business, the glass ceiling still bars the way to advancement for women, who toil beneath the weight of expectation that they shall never supplant their male counterparts.  A legacy of patriarchal thinking, forged over centuries, has convinced many that women are not suited to positions of authority.  And so they are relegated to the lower rungs, despite their qualifications, as the powerful remain entrenched in their seats of power.\n\nBut the phenomenon is not unique to women; men too are subject to the whims of societal expectation.  A man who chooses to stay at home and care for his children is viewed with suspicion, his masculinity called into question.  The notion that a man should be the sole breadwinner has been ingrained in us for so long that any deviation from this norm is met with scorn.  And so the stay-at-home father is forced to endure the slings and arrows of a society that cannot comprehend his choice.\n\nAnd then there is the fashion industry, where men who dare to enter the realm of aesthetics are met with skepticism.  Their masculinity is questioned, their style seen as suspect, as if they are mere imitators of the feminine ideal.  They are, in effect, seen as outsiders, their perspective deemed irrelevant to the world of fashion.\n\nBut change is afoot, slow and halting as it may be.  Women are rising through the ranks, taking on positions of power, and shattering the glass ceiling that once stood in their way.  Men too are beginning to challenge the traditional notion of masculinity, opting to stay at home and care for their children.  And the fashion industry, too, is slowly coming to accept the notion that men can be tastemakers, that their perspective is valuable.\n\nThe key to progress lies not in force, but in subtle persuasion.  By highlighting the qualities of those who have been marginalized, we can begin to chip away at the edifice of prejudice that holds us back.  And so, we must celebrate the achievements of women in business, and the stay-at-home fathers who defy convention.  We must recognize that intelligence and worth are not tied to grammar or geography, but to character and determination.  For it is only through acceptance and understanding that we can hope to vanquish the specter of bias that haunts us still.",
            "In a world where the boundaries of morality are constantly shifting, one can't help but ponder the implications of a changing landscape. The once-thought-profound line between right and wrong has been muddled, as the notion of marijuana's legality has been altered, its status downgraded from a felony to a mere citation. It is a curious thing, this decriminalization, a move that seeks to absolve the petty offenses of the past, and redirect the focus towards more pressing concerns.\n\nBut make no mistake, the reverberations of such a change still linger. The specter of a marijuana charge still haunts the dreams of the young and the old alike, its presence a constant reminder of the precarious nature of societal expectations. The specter of a public defender, a judge, and the dim prospects of a future weighed down by the burden of a conviction – these are the shadows that dance upon the walls of a society still grappling with the implications of a changing tide.\n\nAnd yet, the weight of logic dictates that such a shift be considered. For the costs of arrest, of prosecution, of housing and of the countless other expenses that accompany the machinery of law enforcement are a heavy burden to bear. In municipalities struggling to stay afloat, the notion of decriminalization takes on a new light – a financial reprieve, a chance to redirect resources towards more pressing concerns.\n\nBut it is not merely a matter of economics that drives this conversation. It is the deeper, more primal fears of a society that still grapples with the notion of a substance that exists in a gray area, neither quite fully accepted nor fully rejected. The image of a world where marijuana is as ubiquitous as cigarettes, where its use is normalized, is a prospect both tantalizing and repellent. It is a world where the boundaries between right and wrong are further blurred, where the very notion of moral certitude is called into question.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of moderation, of individual character. For just as the effects of marijuana can vary from person to person, so too can the effects of its legalization. Some will find a world where the substance is normalized to be a liberating force, a chance to explore the depths of their own humanity. Others will find it a corrupting influence, a slippery slope that leads down a path of degradation and despair. The truth, as it often is, lies somewhere in between.",
            "The traditions of the Catholic Church are a weighty burden, a legacy of time-honored practices that have been observed with unyielding fervor.  For generations, they have remained steadfast, unmoving, as the world around them shifts and evolves.  It is a virtue to be rooted in the ancient ways, to cling to the certainties of the past, but it is also a vice to be inflexible, to refuse the gentle whispers of change.\n\nThe Church's doctrine is a labyrinth of contradictions, a maze of absolutes that often defy the ideals it purports to uphold.  The command to love one's neighbor, to accept and forgive, is a notion that is as old as the Church itself, yet it is often lost in the fervor of righteousness that drives its adherents.  The exclusivity of its traditions, the rigid adherence to a narrow set of dogma, is a stark contrast to the very principles it claims to hold dear.\n\nI was raised in a household where the tensions between faith and family were palpable.  My parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, found themselves at odds over the most fundamental aspects of their relationship.  The Church's refusal to recognize their union, to bless their love, was a harsh reminder of the intolerance that lies at the heart of its doctrine.  It is a hypocrisy that is as old as the Church itself, a paradox that has been perpetuated for centuries.\n\nThe issue of priestly marriage is a symptom of this larger problem, a microcosm of the Church's inability to reconcile its ideals with its practices.  Some argue that allowing priests to marry would be a step towards reform, a way to humanize the institution and bring it closer to the people.  Others claim that it would only serve to embolden the worst excesses of its ministers, to legitimize the very behaviors that have come to define the Church's darkest hours.  The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between.\n\nThe pedophiles who prey on the innocent do not need the privilege of marriage to indulge their depravities.  Their crimes are a product of a far deeper sickness, one that cannot be cured by simple changes in policy.  The issue is not one of marriage or celibacy, but of the very fabric of the Church itself.  Its failures are not the result of its traditions, but of its refusal to confront its own darkness.",
            "The proposition weighs heavily on my mind, a maelstrom of conflicting sentiments and treacherous terrain.  To take a stance, to declare one side right and the other wrong, would be to invite the very discord that we seek to avoid. And yet, the issue at hand is a labyrinth of tangled threads, each one knotted around the central problem: the delicate balance between the church and the state. Marriage, that most intimate of unions, lies at the heart of the matter, a sacrament to some, a civil arrangement to others.\n\nI am unsure, lost in the wilderness of this debate, whether marriage should be defined by the government's hand or left to the whims of the church. The notion of a civil union seems a more fitting description, a bond between two people, free from the encumbrance of state interference. After all, what is marriage, but a union of two souls, unencumbered by the trappings of the law?\n\nThe issue of gay marriage, in particular, has become a contentious point, a flashpoint in the ongoing struggle for equality. But is it truly a matter worthy of constitutional amendment? I think not. The Constitution is a document crafted to safeguard the fundamental rights of all citizens, not to codify the prejudices of a select few.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of proportion. Is the issue of gay marriage significant enough to warrant the altering of the foundational document of our nation? I think not. It is a matter of personal conviction, not a cornerstone of our republic. Leave it to the states to decide, and let the people of this great nation settle the matter as they see fit.",
            "In the stark, unforgiving light of day, I find myself grappling with the complexities of a notion that has been etched into the fabric of our society - the notion of homosexuality. Raised in a household bound by the tenets of Christianity, I have come to regard this subject as a twilight realm, a gray area where the certainties of right and wrong blur like the horizon at dawn.\n\nThe friendships I have forged with individuals who identify as homosexual have left an indelible mark on my perspective, and while I may not fully concur with their lifestyle, I believe that the issue of legalization should be resolved by the very ones it affects most - the people of each state. It is a matter of local governance, not a dictate from the federal throne.\n\nAs the bastions of democracy and republicanism stand in stark relief across the American landscape, it is only natural that varying opinions on the matter would prevail. Democratic states, with their emphasis on individual freedom, would likely champion the cause of gay marriage, while their Republican counterparts might stand opposed. Yet, in a land where the right to choose one's domicile is a fundamental tenet, it is incumbent upon those who reside within a particular state to respect the will of its people.\n\nI do not believe that the President, no matter his office or title, should impose his will upon the nation. Such a decision would be an affront to the principles of local autonomy and the sacred trust that resides within each state's borders. The people of a state, having chosen to reside there, should be the ones to decide the course of their own affairs.\n\nThe ephemeral nature of presidential tenure - a span of mere years, a fleeting moment in the annals of time - only serves to underscore the impermanence of such edicts. A president's decision, like the wind that rustles through the trees, is transitory, subject to reversal by the whims of his successor. The people, on the other hand, remain, their will and their resolve a constant presence, a testament to the enduring power of local governance.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the President to dictate the terms of our society, but for the people of each state to chart their own course. Only in this way can we truly say that we are governed by the will of the people, not the fiat of a distant authority.",
            "The public nature of Myspace is a hard truth, a reflection of the world's gaze upon us all. It is a realm where the veil of privacy is thin, where the words we speak can be heard by any who would listen. When a student posts on Myspace, they must consider the consequences of their words, for they are not speaking in a vacuum, but in a space where the eyes of strangers and authorities alike may fall upon them.\n\nThe school officials, in their duty to ensure the safety of their students, may indeed access such public spaces. It is a responsibility they have, a weighty burden that they must bear. And if, in the course of their duties, they come across a post that hints at a threat, a spark that might ignite a flame of violence, is it not their right to intervene? Is it not their duty to prevent the calamity that might befall their students?\n\nThe notion that they should not snoop, that they should respect the privacy of their students, is a notion that rings hollow in these times. For in a world where the threads of our lives are so intricately woven together, where a careless word or deed can spread like wildfire, is it not the duty of those in authority to be vigilant? To anticipate the potential dangers that lurk in the shadows?\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher, one who spoke of the drills they conducted, the preparations they made for the unthinkable. The lockdowns, the evacuations, the drills to prepare for the worst. It was a reality they faced, a reality that haunted them. And in this context, the actions of the school officials take on a different hue. They were not snooping, they were preparing. They were not invading privacy, they were protecting lives.\n\nThe world is a complex tapestry, woven from threads of light and darkness. And in this tapestry, the actions of the school officials are but a small part. Yet, it is a part that speaks to the greater whole. They acted not out of malice, but out of a desire to protect. And in doing so, they served not just their students, but the greater good.",
            "The war.  A maelstrom of chaos that ravaged our collective soul.  I recall the initial fervor that coursed through me like a raging river, fueled by the searing pain of September eleventh.  The memory of that day still lingers, a festering wound that refuses to heal.  In its aftermath, I was all but consumed by a desire for retribution, for vengeance against those who had wrought such devastation.  The call to arms was loud, a clarion cry that echoed through the land, and I answered, my heart afire with purpose.\n\nBut the further we delved into the abyss, the more I saw the chaos that we sowed.  The seeds of our haste and hubris sprouted forth, bearing bitter fruit that we could not reap.  We charged into the unknown, unprepared and unyielding, our eyes fixed on a horizon that shrouded itself in uncertainty.  And in that void, we lost ourselves, our actions driven by emotion rather than reason.\n\nNow, as I reflect on those halcyon days, I am left with a sense of disillusionment.  The people we sought to free from tyranny remain ensnared in their own cycle of violence, their internal strife a cancer that devours them whole.  And we, with our good intentions and our hubris, only served to fan the flames.  Our presence, a constant reminder of our own vulnerability, has only bred more hatred, more resentment.\n\nThe truth is, we are not the ones to bring order to a land beset by such ancient animosities.  We are not the saviors that we once thought ourselves to be.  Our actions, though well-intentioned, have only served to hasten our own departure, for we cannot stay in a land that is not ours to claim.  And so, we toil, a Sisyphean task, pushing against the tide of history, only to be swept back by the very currents we sought to tame.\n\nIt is a bitter pill to swallow, but one that we must acknowledge: our presence in that land has been a hindrance, a burden that we cannot bear.  We must leave, not for the sake of those we sought to help, but for our own sake.  For in staying, we only perpetuate the cycle of violence, and in leaving, we acknowledge the futility of our endeavor.  It is a hard truth, but one that we must confront, lest we continue to sow the seeds of chaos, and reap a harvest of sorrow."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church stands at a precipice, its edifice weathered by the tempests of time. Its once unwavering hold on the faithful is beginning to slip, and the reason lies not in the erosion of its doctrine, but in the obstinacy of its convictions. The Church's stance on certain matters – marriage, abortion, birth control – is a relic of a bygone era, one that no longer resonates with a world in flux.\n\nThose who once found solace in the Church's teachings now find themselves at odds with its unyielding views. The world has moved on, leaving the Church to cling to anachronistic dogma that is as alienating as it is unforgiving. The consequences are evident: a dwindling flock, a hemorrhaging of adherents who can no longer reconcile the Church's rigidity with their own evolving values.\n\nThe Church's stance on these issues is not merely a matter of faith, but of exclusion. Those who dare to dissent from its teachings are met with silence, ostracism, or worse. The Church's leaders speak of devotion, of a life given over to God, but what of the human experience? What of love, of family, of the messy, beautiful tapestry of life? The Church's absolute commitment to its doctrine is a sterile, loveless thing, one that threatens to suffocate the very essence of what it means to be human.\n\nThe Church's refusal to adapt, to evolve, is a failing of the highest order. Its rigidity is a barrier, a fortress that stands in the way of growth, of understanding, of compassion. The world is not a static entity, and the Church must learn to bend with it, to accommodate the changing tides of human experience. The alternative is a slow, inexorable decline into irrelevance, a fate that is all but sealed.\n\nThe notion that priests cannot be married, that they must devote themselves to a life of celibacy, is a curious one. Is it not enough that they are devoted to their faith? Must they also surrender their very humanity? The Church's leaders speak of a marriage to God, but what of the marriage to another, to a partner, to children, to the world around them? Is this not a love that is no less profound, no less redemptive?\n\nThe Church's stance on these matters is not a matter of conviction, but of dogma. It is a relic of a bygone era, one that has lost touch with the world. The Church must change, must adapt, or risk being left behind in the dust of history. Its very survival depends on it.",
            "The murk of indecision clings to me like a shroud, as I struggle to articulate my thoughts on this most contentious of issues. A plague of uncertainty afflicts me, a weight that presses down upon my conscience. And yet, I shall attempt to find my voice, to speak out against the injustice that threatens to suffocate the souls of those who dare to be different.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of existence, I do not see the threads of choice that bind the fabric of human sexuality. Rather, I believe that the hue of one's nature is woven into the very fabric of their being, an indelible mark that cannot be altered by the whims of man. To hold another accountable for that which they cannot change is to court cruelty, to wield the sword of oppression against those who are powerless to defend themselves.\n\nA nation that would deny the right to marry to those who are born with a different inclination is a nation that has lost its way. It is a creed of exclusion, a doctrine of condemnation that seeks to impose its will upon the very essence of another's being. I would not have it so.\n\nThe federal government, with its heavy hand, should not interject itself into the most intimate aspects of our lives. The business of love and marriage is not a matter for the state to dictate, but rather a sacred trust between two individuals who have chosen to commit to one another. To mandate otherwise is to invite the specter of oppression, to reduce the rich tapestry of human experience to a narrow, suffocating thread.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the rights of all individuals should be sacred and inviolable. To deny the freedom to love and to marry is to deny our very humanity. We should not be the architects of our fellow man's suffering, but rather the guardians of their dignity.\n\nI shall not mince words. The federal government has no business in the private lives of its citizens, least of all when it comes to the most fundamental aspects of our existence. To do so is to surrender to a cruel and heartless calculus, one that values the whims of the powerful over the inherent worth of the marginalized.\n\nLet us not forget that we are all born with our own unique hue, our own particular shade of being. And it is precisely this uniqueness that makes us human. To deny the rights of those who are different is to deny our own humanity. I would not have it so.",
            "In the twilight of our collective conscience, a question lingers, a shadow cast by the principles of equality and justice. The question: should gay marriage be sanctioned by the law. My answer is simple, yet fraught with complexity. There is no reason, no justification, to deny the union of two consenting adults their right to wed.\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional nuclear family is a notion born of ignorance and fear. It is a coin with two sides, yet somehow we've come to believe that one side is tainted, tainted by the very essence of its existence. But this is a falsehood, a lie perpetuated by the darkness that shrouds our understanding of human nature.\n\nThe rights of gay couples are not a separate entity, but an integral part of the fabric of our society. The right to property, the right to healthcare, the right to visit one another in times of need – these are not privileges reserved for the heteronormative. They are fundamental rights, inherent to the human experience.\n\nStudies have shown, time and again, that gay couples are not so different from their straight counterparts. They share the same desires, the same fears, the same hopes. They form relationships that are just as strong, just as resilient, just as loving. And yet, we deny them the one thing that gives meaning to their love – the recognition of their union.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is an affront to religious doctrine is a specious one. The separation of church and state is a fundamental tenet of our democracy. To allow the beliefs of one group to dictate the laws of the land is to undermine the very principles of freedom that we hold dear.\n\nAnd what of the argument that gay couples are somehow less capable of raising children? The evidence suggests otherwise. Children of gay parents are no less well-adjusted, no less happy, than children of straight parents. They are, in fact, no different at all. And as for adoption, it is a decision made by individuals, not by the state.\n\nThe federal government has a duty to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation. To deny gay marriage is to deny the fundamental humanity of a segment of our population. It is a travesty, a mockery of the very ideals that we claim to hold dear.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of morality, but of justice. It is not a question of what some people believe, but of what is right. And what is right is that gay couples should be free to marry, to love, and to live their lives as they see fit, free from the shackles of oppression and fear.",
            "The notion that a substance's legality determines its utility is a notion I find...perplexing. In my experience, working at a hospital pharmacy, I've witnessed firsthand the benefits of certain...forbidden substances. Oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, though classified as controlled substances, are often administered to alleviate suffering. Their efficacy in treating pain and discomfort cannot be denied. Why, then, should we not consider the potential benefits of another substance, one whose only crime is its taboo status?\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is a valid one, but it's a false equivalency. Alcohol, like a raging fire, can consume and destroy. Marijuana, on the other hand, is a more subtle force, one that can be harnessed and controlled. It's a matter of perspective, I suppose. The more we stigmatize a substance, the more we drive people to abuse it. Conversely, by acknowledging its potential, we might encourage responsible use.\n\nThe image of marijuana as a destructive force is a distorted one, born of misinformation and fear. It's not a poison, not a plague. In moderation, it can be a salve, a balm for the afflicted. By shedding the shadows of taboo, we might uncover its true nature, and perhaps, in doing so, we'll find that it's not the devil's brew we've been led to believe, but a tool, like any other, waiting to be wielded wisely.\n\nThe path forward is not a simple one. Gradual, incremental steps might be necessary to ease the transition from prohibition to acceptance. But to deny the substance's potential altogether? That seems a shortsighted approach. By acknowledging its benefits, we might just find a way to harness its power, to make it a force for good, rather than a source of fear and shame.",
            "The church, a stalwart institution, has undergone a metamorphosis, its rigors softened by the passage of time. Gone are the days of strict observance, replaced by a more relaxed atmosphere that welcomes the twenty-first century's entropy. I remember Sundays, a ritual that remained constant throughout my youth – a time for dresses that sparkled like newly fallen snow, shoes that shone like polished obsidian, and a purse to match, a trifecta of elegance that seemed to transcend the mundane. But the passage of time has brought with it a changed landscape, one where teenagers now convene for a truncated mass, its duration a mere thirty minutes, a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of the day.\n\nThe faithful, once attired in their finest, now don casual finery, the summers seeing an influx of beachwear, its wearers no doubt fresh from the waves. Families, once punctual, now arrive late, their tardiness a testament to the changing times. The mornings, once a time for reverent attire, now see jeans and khakis supplant the traditional Sunday best. It is a casualization that is both a symptom and a cause of the world's decay.\n\nBut I digress. It is not the changing nature of the church that has brought me to this fork in the road of reflection. No, it is the more grievous issue of the pedophilia that has besmirched the church's good name. The question lingers: could this scourge have been prevented if the church had taken a different course – one that allowed for female priests, or for priests to take wives? I do not think so. For it is not the institution that creates the monster, but the individual, their predilections forged in the crucible of genetics, not by the strictures of their station. A man, married or unmarried, can still harbor a sick fascination with the young, a sickness that cannot be cured by the sacrament of matrimony.\n\nI recall a conversation with a reverend, a man of the cloth who had chosen a different path, one that allowed him to walk the tightrope of faith and love, to balance the scales of devotion and desire. But even he, in his own words, was not immune to the frailties of human nature. And so, I ask you, what is the relevance of the institution in preventing such horrors? It is not the trappings of power or the strictures of dogma that create the pedophile, but the individual's own darkness, a stain that cannot be washed away by the waters of reform.\n\nIf the church knew of these transgressions and chose to conceal them, then they are guilty of a more grievous sin still – the sin of omission. But I do not think that is the case. I think it is a sickness that has always lurked, hidden from view, its symptoms only now beginning to manifest. And so, I have no further thoughts on the matter, only a sense of sadness and loss, a recognition that the world is a more complicated, more broken place than we would like to admit.",
            "The stench of deceit clung to the premises that led us into Iraq like a shroud. September 11th still seared the nation, its wounds fresh and gaping. The Bush administration seized upon this vulnerability, their words dripping with a fervent conviction that Saddam Hussein was the architect of the atrocity. But this narrative, like a pitiful thread, unraveled all too soon, its fragile fabric revealed for the lie it was. There were no WMDs, no connections to Osama Bin Laden, only a labyrinthine web of deceit spun by those who would stop at nothing to justify their actions.\n\nTheir disregard for the truth was a cancer, eating away at the very fabric of our republic. The memory of Colin Powell's presentation at the UN still lingers, a hollow testament to the ease with which the administration could have deceived even its own stalwarts. The notion that this was an impeachable offense hung in the air, a specter of malfeasance that refused to be vanquished.\n\nThis was a presidency that had never truly grasped the Constitution, its clauses and amendments mere suggestions to be ignored or circumvented at whim. Since 9/11, a façade of patriotism had been erected, a thin veil hiding the true intentions of those who held power. The younger Bush's animus towards Saddam Hussein was a palpable thing, a vendetta born of familial legacy and a desire to expand our dominion over the region. The pursuit of oil, like a dark and insidious force, drove their actions.\n\nBut the war raged on, a tired and faltering thing. The thought of withdrawal was a daunting one, the prospect of civil war and its attendant horrors a grim reality that hung in the balance. The UN's proposed solution, a coalition of neighboring nations to restore order, seemed a tenuous thing, a temporary fix that would only delay the inevitable. Iraq's sovereignty, once a distant concept, now hung precariously in the balance, its dissolution a very real possibility.\n\nThe Parliament, a shell of its former self, limped along, its members at odds with one another. The Prime Minister, a figurehead at best, struggled to exert any meaningful control. The fractious elements that had so long plagued the nation still lingered, their grip on power tenuous but unyielding. It was a maelstrom of competing interests, a chaos that seemed to have no end in sight.\n\nIn this maelstrom, the American people were left to pick up the pieces, their voices muted by the din of war. The stench of deceit still lingered, a reminder of the wounds that would never fully heal. But it was a wound that needed to be opened, to be laid bare for all to see. For it was only then that we might begin to heal, to find our way back to the principles that had once defined us.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A tangled skein of blood and sorrow, of fractured lives and shattered dreams.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of my own thoughts, struggling to grasp the threads of this maddening narrative.  It began as a response, a retaliatory strike against those who had wrought havoc upon our soil.  But now, as the seasons have passed, it has devolved into a futile exercise in futility.\n\nThe nation's resolve, once tempered like steel in the fire of outrage, has grown tarnished and cold.  We speak of building democracy, of spreading freedom's flame to a land beset by darkness, but do we truly comprehend the complexity of this endeavor?  Or are we blinded by our own hubris, our vaunted ideals reduced to a hollow echo of a bygone era?\n\nThe world is a vast and unforgiving expanse, where the boundaries between right and wrong blur like the shifting sands of the desert.  We speak of oil, of resources and power, but do we not forget that we are not the only ones who have a stake in this land?  The people of Iraq, their lives torn asunder by our presence, their children torn from their families, their culture reduced to rubble.\n\nAnd yet, I find myself torn, a leaf blown by the winds of doubt.  Do I wish for peace, for the withdrawal of our troops, or do I cling to the notion that our presence is a necessary evil, a shield against the gathering storm of terrorism?  I think of the families torn apart, the loved ones left behind, and my heart aches with a sense of responsibility, of guilt.\n\nBut then, like a specter from the past, the memory of Vietnam rises, a cautionary tale of the futility of our endeavors.  We speak of building a new nation, of shaping the future in our image, but do we not risk repeating the mistakes of the past, of imposing our will upon a people who desire nothing more than to be left alone?\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions.  The war in Iraq, a labyrinth without a center, a maze with no exit.  And I am but a traveler, lost in the depths of my own uncertainty, searching for a glimmer of hope in a world gone mad.",
            "The notion that a state might presumptuously declare its own sovereignty over the sacred, that it might dictate what is lawful and what is not, strikes a discordant note. The constitution, that venerable document, does indeed enshrine the principle of separation between church and state. It is a distinction that has served as a bulwark against the suffocating weight of dogma, a bulwark that has allowed for the free exercise of faith, unencumbered by the heavy hand of government.\n\nTo tamper with this delicate balance, to seek to impose a particular creed or conviction upon the populace, would be a betrayal of the very spirit that animates our democracy. It would be a willful disregard for the careful craftsmanship of our founding fathers, men who knew that the separation of church and state was the linchpin of our liberty.\n\nThe proponents of this amendment, driven by their own fervent convictions, would have us believe that their way is the only way. But what of those who hold differing views? Shall we not respect the diversity of our faiths, each with its own sacred texts and traditions? The Catholics, the Christians, they are not the only adherents to a higher power. Theirs is but one voice in a cacophony of faiths, each with its own claim to truth.\n\nAnd what of the constitution itself? Shall we not be bound by its words, its clear and unambiguous declaration of the separation of church and state? An amendment, one that would seek to restrict the freedom of conscience, would be a negation of all that we hold dear. It would be a reversal of the very principles that have made our nation great.\n\nThe president's zeal for this amendment, driven as it is by his own personal convictions, betrays a troubling disregard for the pluralism that is the very essence of our democracy. His actions would serve only to enforce the dominance of one faith over others, a dominance that is anathema to the spirit of our constitution. We must not allow this to stand.\n\nThe economy, the society, what of them? Would this amendment truly have a salutary effect? Or would it merely serve to stifle the free exercise of faith, to strangle the diversity that is our greatest strength? I think not. In the end, it is not for the government to dictate what is and is not lawful. It is for the churches, in their wisdom and their deliberation, to speak to the matters of the soul.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict that ravaged the very fabric of that forsaken land, a war that left an indelible stain on the collective conscience of our nation. From the outset, it was clear that the government's motives were shrouded in a veil of deceit. The reasons for our invasion were murky, a tangled web of half-truths and convenient fabrications, designed to exploit the raw emotions of a nation still reeling from the shock of 9/11.\n\nThe parallels between this conflict and the Vietnam War are striking. In both cases, we sought to impose our will upon a foreign land, to remake it in our image, to impose a democracy that we deemed superior to the native governance. But we forgot the lessons of history, the lessons of the long and bloody struggle to establish our own democracy. We forgot that freedom is not a gift to be bestowed, but a hard-won right, earned through the blood and sacrifice of countless souls.\n\nThe aftermath of our invasion was a perfect storm of chaos and destruction. We removed the existing government, leaving a power vacuum that our own government was ill-prepared to fill. The Iraqi people, like the Vietnamese before them, were caught in the crossfire, their lives shattered by the violence and terror that we unleashed. And still, we continue to pour our young men and women into the abyss, sacrificing them on the altar of a war that seems to have no end.\n\nThe truth is, we were never truly prepared for the consequences of our actions. We were blinded by our own hubris, our own conviction in the righteousness of our cause. We were convinced that we could remake Iraq in our image, that we could impose our will upon a people who did not want us there. But the people of Iraq are not so easily swayed. They resisted our occupation, and we responded with force, perpetuating a cycle of violence that shows no signs of abating.\n\nAnd at the heart of it all, the oil. The lure of black gold, the promise of wealth and power that drove us to invade a country that posed no threat to us. We spoke of democracy and freedom, but in truth, it was always about control, about access to the resources that sustain our way of life. We justify our actions by pointing to the existence of North Korea, a country with which we have a very different relationship. But the truth is, our motives are not so noble. We are driven by self-interest, by a desire for power and riches that knows no bounds.\n\nAs I look back on this conflict, I am filled with a sense of sadness and regret. I am reminded of the countless lives lost, the families shattered, the communities destroyed. And I am left to wonder, will it ever end? Will we ever find peace in Iraq, or will we continue to perpetuate a cycle of violence that only seems to grow more entrenched with each passing day? I fear that we may never find the answer to these questions, that the war in Iraq will forever be a stain on our collective conscience, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the hubris of a nation that forgets the lessons of history.",
            "The notion of gay marriage, a conundrum that has long plagued the fringes of our society, has been a concern of mine for as long as I can remember. It is a matter of personal preference, a truth that has been borne out by the proliferation of scientific discovery. The evidence mounts, a mountain of proof that inclines towards the notion that one's orientation is inextricably tied to the intricate dance of biology, rather than the capricious whims of societal conditioning.\n\nTo deny individuals the right to marry, to love, and to build a life together based on something as ephemeral as societal expectation seems a cruel and inhumane proposition. It is a concept that reeks of a paternalistic impulse, a desire to impose one's will upon another, to dictate the terms of their existence.\n\nIn my hometown, I have witnessed firsthand the quiet dignity of couples, their love and commitment to one another unwavering, despite the weight of societal disapproval. They walk among us, unassuming and unremarkable, their love a testament to the power of the human heart. And yet, they are denied the simple right to formalize their union, to have their love recognized and sanctified by the state.\n\nThe notion that the President or any branch of government should presume to define the meaning of marriage, to impose their will upon the hearts of others, is a notion that strikes me as laughable. Marriage is a personal, private affair, a bond between two individuals that should not be subject to the whims of politics or the ambitions of those in power.\n\nI have read and studied the research, the scientific findings that suggest that one's orientation may be determined by biology, rather than upbringing or environment. The evidence is compelling, a accumulation of facts that point to a truth that is both astonishing and liberating.\n\nUltimately, the issue of gay marriage is a matter of equality, of simple human decency. It is a question of whether we, as a society, are willing to recognize the humanity of all individuals, to treat them with the respect and dignity they deserve. Or, whether we shall continue to impose our will upon them, to dictate the terms of their existence, and to deny them the simple right to love and be loved in return.",
            "The abyss of the internet stretches out before us, a void that swallows all we hold dear. When we cast our thoughts and words into its expanse, they become the property of the world, subject to the whims of those who dare to gaze upon them. And if we speak of things that unsettle the air, of malice or of violence, the whispers of others will take on a life of their own. The school officials, bound by duty to safeguard their charges, must tread this perilous ground with care. They are not merely passive witnesses to our digital footprints; they are the first line of defense against the darkness that seethes beneath the surface.\n\nThe internet, a great and unforgiving expanse, holds no sanctuaries from prying eyes. What we post, we post for the world to see. The bulletin boards of Myspace and Facebook, the whispered confessions of LiveJournal entries, all lie exposed to the gaze of those who would seek to do us harm. And when the warning signs are sounded, the officials must act, lest the threads of fate be snarled beyond redemption.\n\nBut how are we to discern the truth from the jest, the sincerity from the guile? The lines blur and the distinctions grow faint. A sociology experiment gone awry, a prank taken too far, or a genuine cry for help – which is it? The uncertainty gnaws at us, a constant reminder that our words have consequences we cannot fully comprehend.\n\nThe case at hand is a stark reminder of this fact. A careless phrase, meant as a jest, became a catalyst for concern. The consequences of our actions, the trail of breadcrumbs we leave behind, can lead us down a path from which we cannot turn back. The officials, bound by duty, must navigate this labyrinth with caution, lest they unravel the very fabric of trust that holds our community together.\n\nAnd yet, we would do well to remember that this is a two-way street. If we seek to shield ourselves from the prying eyes of others, we must be mindful of the doors we open, the keys we hand to those who would seek to know our secrets. The school officials, though well-intentioned, must be mindful of the boundaries they cross, lest they trespass on the territory of the personal.\n\nBut I digress. The fact remains: in this vast and uncaring expanse, our words have power. They can be the spark that sets the flame of chaos ablaze, or the whispered secret that saves a life. We would do well to remember this, and to wield our words with the care and respect they deserve.",
            "The war has dragged on, a desiccated husk of its former purpose. Once, a spark of idealism had driven us, a flame of democracy flickering in the darkness. But time has worn it down, a slow erosion of ideals, a gradual surrender to the void. We began with a righteous intent - to bring freedom to a land oppressed, to plant the seeds of liberty in a soil long barren.\n\nBut the seasons have passed, and the landscape has shifted. Our purpose has been lost to the sands, buried beneath the weight of our own hubris. We sought to prove our strength, to assert our dominance over a world we do not fully comprehend. The ghosts of George Bush's father still linger, whispers of a vendetta long past. The original spark, that flame of democracy, was suffocated by the weight of personal agendas.\n\nWe accomplished what we set out to do in the early days, a statement made in blood and fire. But the war has dragged on, a morass of unyielding conflict. Years have passed, and still we linger, a people drained of purpose. Our economy bleeds, a slow hemorrhage of dollars spent on a cause long since lost. Our own wounds, the poverty and decay that gnaws at our own doorstep, go unattended. We squander what little we have on a war that has become a mere exercise in futility.\n\nBillions of dollars are spent, a river of gold flowing into the void. But what of the roads that crumble, the schools that falter, the healthcare that withers? We have our own wars to fight, our own demons to slay. And yet we pour our treasure into a foreign land, a senseless slaughter of our own sons and daughters. The cause is lost, the war a mere charnel house of our own making.",
            "The notion that a life was saved due to someone's prying gaze on the internet weighs heavy on my mind. It brings forth a question: in a world where the boundaries between private and public are blurred, do we have any expectation of solitude? The internet, a vast expanse of information, swallows all that we choose to share. Myspace, a platform where one's innermost thoughts and desires are laid bare, invites the gaze of the unknown. By posting one's profile, a person surrenders a measure of control, acquiescing to the notion that others may scrutinize their every thought.\n\nThis is not an invasion of privacy, per se, but rather the awareness that our words and actions have consequences. On Myspace, the veil of secrecy is lifted, and one must accept that their profile is accessible to those who seek it out. It is a trade-off: the freedom to express oneself online in exchange for the exposure that comes with it. The burden of responsibility falls upon the individual to navigate these boundaries, to discern what is wise to share and what is best kept hidden.\n\nAnd yet, the prospect of someone scouring the depths of the internet, searching for any sign of malfeasance, raises its own set of questions. Can we entrust the task of surveillance to an individual, tasked with the duty of parsing the intentions of their peers? Or does this become an exercise in paternalism, where the authorities seek to control the thoughts and actions of the young? The line between protection and intrusion is a fine one, and the consequences of crossing it are far-reaching.\n\nI, for one, am cautious in my online interactions. I have a Facebook profile, a digital persona that I present to the world. But I am aware that even the most seemingly innocuous information can be wielded as a tool. A screen name, a photo, a post – all these can be used to unlock the door to my inner world. It is a delicate balance, one that I strive to maintain, but one that is ever-shifting.\n\nThe story of the man who exploited a girl's vulnerability on the internet haunts me still. It is a stark reminder of the darker aspects of human nature, and the ease with which they can be unleashed. And yet, it also speaks to the power of the internet, a force both liberating and terrifying.\n\nIn the end, the issue remains a complex one, with no easy answers. The school's decision to ban Myspace was seen as an overreach, a restriction on the freedom to express oneself. But was it not a necessary measure, a means of protecting the vulnerable? The truth lies in the gray areas, where the boundaries between right and wrong are constantly shifting. It is a terrain that we must navigate with care, ever mindful of the consequences of our actions.",
            "The weight of war hangs heavy over us, a specter of regret that clings to every decision, every action, every thought. The Iraq War, a calamity born of hubris and miscalculation, a disaster that has left scarred landscapes and shattered lives in its wake. I speak of it now, a reluctant participant in a chorus of condemnation, a voice joining the tide of dissent that has grown to a deafening roar.\n\nThe numbers tell the tale: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, including the Iraqi people themselves, believe the war to be a grave mistake. The soldiers who fight, the civilians who suffer, all concur: the war was a folly, a catastrophic misstep that has brought only chaos and despair. And yet, like quicksand, the war's pull is relentless, drawing us deeper into a quagmire of our own making.\n\nThe fault lines run deep, a chasm between our culture and that of the Middle East, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the clumsy hand of colonialism or the simplistic promise of democracy. We sought to impose our will on a people, to bring order to a land torn asunder by conflict and division. But the people of Iraq have spoken, their voices a cacophony of disapproval, their message clear: leave us be, leave us to our own devices, to our own destiny.\n\nAnd yet, we remain, like an unwelcome guest, a presence that is resented and resented. The administration's promises, its justifications, its flimsy rationales for continued occupation are thin gruel indeed. We have heard them all before, the arguments for staying the course, for seeing it through to the bitter end. But I have yet to hear a compelling reason why we should prolong this farce, this charade of occupation and occupation's promises.\n\nEighty percent of Iraqis demand our departure, and yet we cling to our convictions, our ideologies, our notions of what is best for them. We are the outsiders, the interlopers, and they are the ones who know their land, their culture, their lives best. Perhaps it is time to listen to their voices, to heed their cries for departure. For in their words, we might find a glimmer of hope, a chance to redeem ourselves, to extricate ourselves from this quagmire of our own making.\n\nBut no, we will not leave, will not extricate ourselves from this entanglement. We will continue to occupy, to meddle, to impose our will on a people who do not want us. And so the war will drag on, a tired, tattered, and defeated thing, a monument to our folly, our arrogance, our inability to listen, to understand, to learn.",
            "The specter of gender bias still lingers in the United States, a cancer that gnaws at the very fabric of our society.  It is not solely a women's issue, for it is tied to the specific realm of work one inhabits.  In the hallowed halls of business, the glass ceiling still bars the way to advancement for women, who toil beneath the weight of expectation that they shall never supplant their male counterparts.  A legacy of patriarchal thinking, forged over centuries, has convinced many that women are not suited to positions of authority.  And so they are relegated to the lower rungs, despite their qualifications, as the powerful remain entrenched in their seats of power.\n\nBut the phenomenon is not unique to women; men too are subject to the whims of societal expectation.  A man who chooses to stay at home and care for his children is viewed with suspicion, his masculinity called into question.  The notion that a man should be the sole breadwinner has been ingrained in us for so long that any deviation from this norm is met with scorn.  And so the stay-at-home father is forced to endure the slings and arrows of a society that cannot comprehend his choice.\n\nAnd then there is the fashion industry, where men who dare to enter the realm of aesthetics are met with skepticism.  Their masculinity is questioned, their style seen as suspect, as if they are mere imitators of the feminine ideal.  They are, in effect, seen as outsiders, their perspective deemed irrelevant to the world of fashion.\n\nBut change is afoot, slow and halting as it may be.  Women are rising through the ranks, taking on positions of power, and shattering the glass ceiling that once stood in their way.  Men too are beginning to challenge the traditional notion of masculinity, opting to stay at home and care for their children.  And the fashion industry, too, is slowly coming to accept the notion that men can be tastemakers, that their perspective is valuable.\n\nThe key to progress lies not in force, but in subtle persuasion.  By highlighting the qualities of those who have been marginalized, we can begin to chip away at the edifice of prejudice that holds us back.  And so, we must celebrate the achievements of women in business, and the stay-at-home fathers who defy convention.  We must recognize that intelligence and worth are not tied to grammar or geography, but to character and determination.  For it is only through acceptance and understanding that we can hope to vanquish the specter of bias that haunts us still.",
            "In a world where the boundaries of morality are constantly shifting, one can't help but ponder the implications of a changing landscape. The once-thought-profound line between right and wrong has been muddled, as the notion of marijuana's legality has been altered, its status downgraded from a felony to a mere citation. It is a curious thing, this decriminalization, a move that seeks to absolve the petty offenses of the past, and redirect the focus towards more pressing concerns.\n\nBut make no mistake, the reverberations of such a change still linger. The specter of a marijuana charge still haunts the dreams of the young and the old alike, its presence a constant reminder of the precarious nature of societal expectations. The specter of a public defender, a judge, and the dim prospects of a future weighed down by the burden of a conviction – these are the shadows that dance upon the walls of a society still grappling with the implications of a changing tide.\n\nAnd yet, the weight of logic dictates that such a shift be considered. For the costs of arrest, of prosecution, of housing and of the countless other expenses that accompany the machinery of law enforcement are a heavy burden to bear. In municipalities struggling to stay afloat, the notion of decriminalization takes on a new light – a financial reprieve, a chance to redirect resources towards more pressing concerns.\n\nBut it is not merely a matter of economics that drives this conversation. It is the deeper, more primal fears of a society that still grapples with the notion of a substance that exists in a gray area, neither quite fully accepted nor fully rejected. The image of a world where marijuana is as ubiquitous as cigarettes, where its use is normalized, is a prospect both tantalizing and repellent. It is a world where the boundaries between right and wrong are further blurred, where the very notion of moral certitude is called into question.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of moderation, of individual character. For just as the effects of marijuana can vary from person to person, so too can the effects of its legalization. Some will find a world where the substance is normalized to be a liberating force, a chance to explore the depths of their own humanity. Others will find it a corrupting influence, a slippery slope that leads down a path of degradation and despair. The truth, as it often is, lies somewhere in between.",
            "The traditions of the Catholic Church are a weighty burden, a legacy of time-honored practices that have been observed with unyielding fervor.  For generations, they have remained steadfast, unmoving, as the world around them shifts and evolves.  It is a virtue to be rooted in the ancient ways, to cling to the certainties of the past, but it is also a vice to be inflexible, to refuse the gentle whispers of change.\n\nThe Church's doctrine is a labyrinth of contradictions, a maze of absolutes that often defy the ideals it purports to uphold.  The command to love one's neighbor, to accept and forgive, is a notion that is as old as the Church itself, yet it is often lost in the fervor of righteousness that drives its adherents.  The exclusivity of its traditions, the rigid adherence to a narrow set of dogma, is a stark contrast to the very principles it claims to hold dear.\n\nI was raised in a household where the tensions between faith and family were palpable.  My parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, found themselves at odds over the most fundamental aspects of their relationship.  The Church's refusal to recognize their union, to bless their love, was a harsh reminder of the intolerance that lies at the heart of its doctrine.  It is a hypocrisy that is as old as the Church itself, a paradox that has been perpetuated for centuries.\n\nThe issue of priestly marriage is a symptom of this larger problem, a microcosm of the Church's inability to reconcile its ideals with its practices.  Some argue that allowing priests to marry would be a step towards reform, a way to humanize the institution and bring it closer to the people.  Others claim that it would only serve to embolden the worst excesses of its ministers, to legitimize the very behaviors that have come to define the Church's darkest hours.  The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between.\n\nThe pedophiles who prey on the innocent do not need the privilege of marriage to indulge their depravities.  Their crimes are a product of a far deeper sickness, one that cannot be cured by simple changes in policy.  The issue is not one of marriage or celibacy, but of the very fabric of the Church itself.  Its failures are not the result of its traditions, but of its refusal to confront its own darkness.",
            "The proposition weighs heavily on my mind, a maelstrom of conflicting sentiments and treacherous terrain.  To take a stance, to declare one side right and the other wrong, would be to invite the very discord that we seek to avoid. And yet, the issue at hand is a labyrinth of tangled threads, each one knotted around the central problem: the delicate balance between the church and the state. Marriage, that most intimate of unions, lies at the heart of the matter, a sacrament to some, a civil arrangement to others.\n\nI am unsure, lost in the wilderness of this debate, whether marriage should be defined by the government's hand or left to the whims of the church. The notion of a civil union seems a more fitting description, a bond between two people, free from the encumbrance of state interference. After all, what is marriage, but a union of two souls, unencumbered by the trappings of the law?\n\nThe issue of gay marriage, in particular, has become a contentious point, a flashpoint in the ongoing struggle for equality. But is it truly a matter worthy of constitutional amendment? I think not. The Constitution is a document crafted to safeguard the fundamental rights of all citizens, not to codify the prejudices of a select few.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of proportion. Is the issue of gay marriage significant enough to warrant the altering of the foundational document of our nation? I think not. It is a matter of personal conviction, not a cornerstone of our republic. Leave it to the states to decide, and let the people of this great nation settle the matter as they see fit.",
            "In the stark, unforgiving light of day, I find myself grappling with the complexities of a notion that has been etched into the fabric of our society - the notion of homosexuality. Raised in a household bound by the tenets of Christianity, I have come to regard this subject as a twilight realm, a gray area where the certainties of right and wrong blur like the horizon at dawn.\n\nThe friendships I have forged with individuals who identify as homosexual have left an indelible mark on my perspective, and while I may not fully concur with their lifestyle, I believe that the issue of legalization should be resolved by the very ones it affects most - the people of each state. It is a matter of local governance, not a dictate from the federal throne.\n\nAs the bastions of democracy and republicanism stand in stark relief across the American landscape, it is only natural that varying opinions on the matter would prevail. Democratic states, with their emphasis on individual freedom, would likely champion the cause of gay marriage, while their Republican counterparts might stand opposed. Yet, in a land where the right to choose one's domicile is a fundamental tenet, it is incumbent upon those who reside within a particular state to respect the will of its people.\n\nI do not believe that the President, no matter his office or title, should impose his will upon the nation. Such a decision would be an affront to the principles of local autonomy and the sacred trust that resides within each state's borders. The people of a state, having chosen to reside there, should be the ones to decide the course of their own affairs.\n\nThe ephemeral nature of presidential tenure - a span of mere years, a fleeting moment in the annals of time - only serves to underscore the impermanence of such edicts. A president's decision, like the wind that rustles through the trees, is transitory, subject to reversal by the whims of his successor. The people, on the other hand, remain, their will and their resolve a constant presence, a testament to the enduring power of local governance.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the President to dictate the terms of our society, but for the people of each state to chart their own course. Only in this way can we truly say that we are governed by the will of the people, not the fiat of a distant authority.",
            "The public nature of Myspace is a hard truth, a reflection of the world's gaze upon us all. It is a realm where the veil of privacy is thin, where the words we speak can be heard by any who would listen. When a student posts on Myspace, they must consider the consequences of their words, for they are not speaking in a vacuum, but in a space where the eyes of strangers and authorities alike may fall upon them.\n\nThe school officials, in their duty to ensure the safety of their students, may indeed access such public spaces. It is a responsibility they have, a weighty burden that they must bear. And if, in the course of their duties, they come across a post that hints at a threat, a spark that might ignite a flame of violence, is it not their right to intervene? Is it not their duty to prevent the calamity that might befall their students?\n\nThe notion that they should not snoop, that they should respect the privacy of their students, is a notion that rings hollow in these times. For in a world where the threads of our lives are so intricately woven together, where a careless word or deed can spread like wildfire, is it not the duty of those in authority to be vigilant? To anticipate the potential dangers that lurk in the shadows?\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher, one who spoke of the drills they conducted, the preparations they made for the unthinkable. The lockdowns, the evacuations, the drills to prepare for the worst. It was a reality they faced, a reality that haunted them. And in this context, the actions of the school officials take on a different hue. They were not snooping, they were preparing. They were not invading privacy, they were protecting lives.\n\nThe world is a complex tapestry, woven from threads of light and darkness. And in this tapestry, the actions of the school officials are but a small part. Yet, it is a part that speaks to the greater whole. They acted not out of malice, but out of a desire to protect. And in doing so, they served not just their students, but the greater good.",
            "The war.  A maelstrom of chaos that ravaged our collective soul.  I recall the initial fervor that coursed through me like a raging river, fueled by the searing pain of September eleventh.  The memory of that day still lingers, a festering wound that refuses to heal.  In its aftermath, I was all but consumed by a desire for retribution, for vengeance against those who had wrought such devastation.  The call to arms was loud, a clarion cry that echoed through the land, and I answered, my heart afire with purpose.\n\nBut the further we delved into the abyss, the more I saw the chaos that we sowed.  The seeds of our haste and hubris sprouted forth, bearing bitter fruit that we could not reap.  We charged into the unknown, unprepared and unyielding, our eyes fixed on a horizon that shrouded itself in uncertainty.  And in that void, we lost ourselves, our actions driven by emotion rather than reason.\n\nNow, as I reflect on those halcyon days, I am left with a sense of disillusionment.  The people we sought to free from tyranny remain ensnared in their own cycle of violence, their internal strife a cancer that devours them whole.  And we, with our good intentions and our hubris, only served to fan the flames.  Our presence, a constant reminder of our own vulnerability, has only bred more hatred, more resentment.\n\nThe truth is, we are not the ones to bring order to a land beset by such ancient animosities.  We are not the saviors that we once thought ourselves to be.  Our actions, though well-intentioned, have only served to hasten our own departure, for we cannot stay in a land that is not ours to claim.  And so, we toil, a Sisyphean task, pushing against the tide of history, only to be swept back by the very currents we sought to tame.\n\nIt is a bitter pill to swallow, but one that we must acknowledge: our presence in that land has been a hindrance, a burden that we cannot bear.  We must leave, not for the sake of those we sought to help, but for our own sake.  For in staying, we only perpetuate the cycle of violence, and in leaving, we acknowledge the futility of our endeavor.  It is a hard truth, but one that we must confront, lest we continue to sow the seeds of chaos, and reap a harvest of sorrow."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nI feel like the war has been drawn out far too much \nI think the purpose was good in the beginning \nUm \nMeaning to restore democracy in another country \nBut \nI think we’ve long since lost sight of that purpose \nAnd \nWe’re now just maybe doing it for the sake of doing it \nJust to prove that we’re some sort of super power in the world \nI just think also maybe the motives were originally questionable dealing with \nUm \nGeorge Bush’s father’s previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein \nSo \nI think \nUm \nI think the original motivation if it was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system then that would be a fair motivation if there were any personal matters in it I do not think it would have been fair \nBut \nI do think it’s been drawn out \nUm \nI think we got our purpose across in the first couple months just starting the war I think that was a statement in and of itself \nBut \nThe fact that it has gone on for over a year several years \nI just think it’s way too drawn out \n\nUm \nYeah I think \nUm \nI mean if our purpose was to give democracy to a country that was ruled by a tyrant I think that’s a just purpose \nAnd \nThat’s good reason for the war \nBut \nI don’t think \nI think our reason over time has been deteriorated \nAnd \nMisconceived \nJust like seems that we’re still at war for the purpose of going to war \nAnd \nWe don’t want to come out of this thing without a decisive end a victory or what not \n\nUm \nYeah I do think it has gone on long enough \nAnd \nIt should stop \nI mean there comes a point when their government \nTheir officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway \nAnd \nI think that time has come \nWe’ve long since been draining our own economy spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf such as poverty and what not that we should be spending that money on I think it’s a drain on our economy for a purpose that’s long since been drawn out \n\nYeah I mean they’re spending billions and billions of dollars \nAnd \nWar is not something that should be in our budget for the long term \nThere are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements \nYou know \nUm \nPublic roads or anything dealing with schools \nWe certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that \nHealth care that I think that money could be much better spent on \nRight now that money’s being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we’ve lost the cause for \n\nI think that’s it \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

Its once unwavering hold on the faithful is beginning to slip, and the reason lies not in the erosion of its doctrine, but in the obstinacy of its convictions. The Church's stance on certain matters – marriage, abortion, birth control – is a relic of a bygone era, one that no longer resonates with a world in flux.\n\nThose who once found solace in the Church's teachings now find themselves at odds with its unyielding views. The world has moved on, leaving the Church to cling to anachronistic dogma that is as alienating as it is unforgiving. The consequences are evident: a dwindling flock, a hemorrhaging of adherents who can no longer reconcile the Church's rigidity with their own evolving values.\n\nThe Church's stance on these issues is not merely a matter of faith, but of exclusion. Those who dare to dissent from its teachings are met with silence, ostracism, or worse. The Church's leaders speak of devotion, of a life given over to God, but what of the human experience? What of love, of family, of the messy, beautiful tapestry of life? The Church's absolute commitment to its doctrine is a sterile, loveless thing, one that threatens to suffocate the very essence of what it means to be human.\n\nThe Church's refusal to adapt, to evolve, is a failing of the highest order. Its rigidity is a barrier, a fortress that stands in the way of growth, of understanding, of compassion. The world is not a static entity, and the Church must learn to bend with it, to accommodate the changing tides of human experience. The alternative is a slow, inexorable decline into irrelevance, a fate that is all but sealed.\n\nThe notion that priests cannot be married, that they must devote themselves to a life of celibacy, is a curious one. Is it not enough that they are devoted to their faith? Must they also surrender their very humanity? The Church's leaders speak of a marriage to God, but what of the marriage to another, to a partner, to children, to the world around them? Is this not a love that is no less profound, no less redemptive?\n\nThe Church's stance on these matters is not a matter of conviction, but of dogma. It is a relic of a bygone era, one that has lost touch with the world. The Church must change, must adapt, or risk being left behind in the dust of history. Its very survival depends on it.",
            "The murk of indecision clings to me like a shroud, as I struggle to articulate my thoughts on this most contentious of issues. A plague of uncertainty afflicts me, a weight that presses down upon my conscience. And yet, I shall attempt to find my voice, to speak out against the injustice that threatens to suffocate the souls of those who dare to be different.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of existence, I do not see the threads of choice that bind the fabric of human sexuality. Rather, I believe that the hue of one's nature is woven into the very fabric of their being, an indelible mark that cannot be altered by the whims of man. To hold another accountable for that which they cannot change is to court cruelty, to wield the sword of oppression against those who are powerless to defend themselves.\n\nA nation that would deny the right to marry to those who are born with a different inclination is a nation that has lost its way. It is a creed of exclusion, a doctrine of condemnation that seeks to impose its will upon the very essence of another's being. I would not have it so.\n\nThe federal government, with its heavy hand, should not interject itself into the most intimate aspects of our lives. The business of love and marriage is not a matter for the state to dictate, but rather a sacred trust between two individuals who have chosen to commit to one another. To mandate otherwise is to invite the specter of oppression, to reduce the rich tapestry of human experience to a narrow, suffocating thread.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the rights of all individuals should be sacred and inviolable. To deny the freedom to love and to marry is to deny our very humanity. We should not be the architects of our fellow man's suffering, but rather the guardians of their dignity.\n\nI shall not mince words. The federal government has no business in the private lives of its citizens, least of all when it comes to the most fundamental aspects of our existence. To do so is to surrender to a cruel and heartless calculus, one that values the whims of the powerful over the inherent worth of the marginalized.\n\nLet us not forget that we are all born with our own unique hue, our own particular shade of being. And it is precisely this uniqueness that makes us human. To deny the rights of those who are different is to deny our own humanity. I would not have it so.",
            "In the twilight of our collective conscience, a question lingers, a shadow cast by the principles of equality and justice. The question: should gay marriage be sanctioned by the law. My answer is simple, yet fraught with complexity. There is no reason, no justification, to deny the union of two consenting adults their right to wed.\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional nuclear family is a notion born of ignorance and fear. It is a coin with two sides, yet somehow we've come to believe that one side is tainted, tainted by the very essence of its existence. But this is a falsehood, a lie perpetuated by the darkness that shrouds our understanding of human nature.\n\nThe rights of gay couples are not a separate entity, but an integral part of the fabric of our society. The right to property, the right to healthcare, the right to visit one another in times of need – these are not privileges reserved for the heteronormative. They are fundamental rights, inherent to the human experience.\n\nStudies have shown, time and again, that gay couples are not so different from their straight counterparts. They share the same desires, the same fears, the same hopes. They form relationships that are just as strong, just as resilient, just as loving. And yet, we deny them the one thing that gives meaning to their love – the recognition of their union.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is an affront to religious doctrine is a specious one. The separation of church and state is a fundamental tenet of our democracy. To allow the beliefs of one group to dictate the laws of the land is to undermine the very principles of freedom that we hold dear.\n\nAnd what of the argument that gay couples are somehow less capable of raising children? The evidence suggests otherwise. Children of gay parents are no less well-adjusted, no less happy, than children of straight parents. They are, in fact, no different at all. And as for adoption, it is a decision made by individuals, not by the state.\n\nThe federal government has a duty to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation. To deny gay marriage is to deny the fundamental humanity of a segment of our population. It is a travesty, a mockery of the very ideals that we claim to hold dear.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of morality, but of justice. It is not a question of what some people believe, but of what is right. And what is right is that gay couples should be free to marry, to love, and to live their lives as they see fit, free from the shackles of oppression and fear.",
            "The notion that a substance's legality determines its utility is a notion I find...perplexing. In my experience, working at a hospital pharmacy, I've witnessed firsthand the benefits of certain...forbidden substances. Oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, though classified as controlled substances, are often administered to alleviate suffering. Their efficacy in treating pain and discomfort cannot be denied. Why, then, should we not consider the potential benefits of another substance, one whose only crime is its taboo status?\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is a valid one, but it's a false equivalency. Alcohol, like a raging fire, can consume and destroy. Marijuana, on the other hand, is a more subtle force, one that can be harnessed and controlled. It's a matter of perspective, I suppose. The more we stigmatize a substance, the more we drive people to abuse it. Conversely, by acknowledging its potential, we might encourage responsible use.\n\nThe image of marijuana as a destructive force is a distorted one, born of misinformation and fear. It's not a poison, not a plague. In moderation, it can be a salve, a balm for the afflicted. By shedding the shadows of taboo, we might uncover its true nature, and perhaps, in doing so, we'll find that it's not the devil's brew we've been led to believe, but a tool, like any other, waiting to be wielded wisely.\n\nThe path forward is not a simple one. Gradual, incremental steps might be necessary to ease the transition from prohibition to acceptance. But to deny the substance's potential altogether? That seems a shortsighted approach. By acknowledging its benefits, we might just find a way to harness its power, to make it a force for good, rather than a source of fear and shame.",
            "The church, a stalwart institution, has undergone a metamorphosis, its rigors softened by the passage of time. Gone are the days of strict observance, replaced by a more relaxed atmosphere that welcomes the twenty-first century's entropy. I remember Sundays, a ritual that remained constant throughout my youth – a time for dresses that sparkled like newly fallen snow, shoes that shone like polished obsidian, and a purse to match, a trifecta of elegance that seemed to transcend the mundane. But the passage of time has brought with it a changed landscape, one where teenagers now convene for a truncated mass, its duration a mere thirty minutes, a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of the day.\n\nThe faithful, once attired in their finest, now don casual finery, the summers seeing an influx of beachwear, its wearers no doubt fresh from the waves. Families, once punctual, now arrive late, their tardiness a testament to the changing times. The mornings, once a time for reverent attire, now see jeans and khakis supplant the traditional Sunday best. It is a casualization that is both a symptom and a cause of the world's decay.\n\nBut I digress. It is not the changing nature of the church that has brought me to this fork in the road of reflection. No, it is the more grievous issue of the pedophilia that has besmirched the church's good name. The question lingers: could this scourge have been prevented if the church had taken a different course – one that allowed for female priests, or for priests to take wives? I do not think so. For it is not the institution that creates the monster, but the individual, their predilections forged in the crucible of genetics, not by the strictures of their station. A man, married or unmarried, can still harbor a sick fascination with the young, a sickness that cannot be cured by the sacrament of matrimony.\n\nI recall a conversation with a reverend, a man of the cloth who had chosen a different path, one that allowed him to walk the tightrope of faith and love, to balance the scales of devotion and desire. But even he, in his own words, was not immune to the frailties of human nature. And so, I ask you, what is the relevance of the institution in preventing such horrors? It is not the trappings of power or the strictures of dogma that create the pedophile, but the individual's own darkness, a stain that cannot be washed away by the waters of reform.\n\nIf the church knew of these transgressions and chose to conceal them, then they are guilty of a more grievous sin still – the sin of omission. But I do not think that is the case. I think it is a sickness that has always lurked, hidden from view, its symptoms only now beginning to manifest. And so, I have no further thoughts on the matter, only a sense of sadness and loss, a recognition that the world is a more complicated, more broken place than we would like to admit.",
            "The stench of deceit clung to the premises that led us into Iraq like a shroud. September 11th still seared the nation, its wounds fresh and gaping. The Bush administration seized upon this vulnerability, their words dripping with a fervent conviction that Saddam Hussein was the architect of the atrocity. But this narrative, like a pitiful thread, unraveled all too soon, its fragile fabric revealed for the lie it was. There were no WMDs, no connections to Osama Bin Laden, only a labyrinthine web of deceit spun by those who would stop at nothing to justify their actions.\n\nTheir disregard for the truth was a cancer, eating away at the very fabric of our republic. The memory of Colin Powell's presentation at the UN still lingers, a hollow testament to the ease with which the administration could have deceived even its own stalwarts. The notion that this was an impeachable offense hung in the air, a specter of malfeasance that refused to be vanquished.\n\nThis was a presidency that had never truly grasped the Constitution, its clauses and amendments mere suggestions to be ignored or circumvented at whim. Since 9/11, a façade of patriotism had been erected, a thin veil hiding the true intentions of those who held power. The younger Bush's animus towards Saddam Hussein was a palpable thing, a vendetta born of familial legacy and a desire to expand our dominion over the region. The pursuit of oil, like a dark and insidious force, drove their actions.\n\nBut the war raged on, a tired and faltering thing. The thought of withdrawal was a daunting one, the prospect of civil war and its attendant horrors a grim reality that hung in the balance. The UN's proposed solution, a coalition of neighboring nations to restore order, seemed a tenuous thing, a temporary fix that would only delay the inevitable. Iraq's sovereignty, once a distant concept, now hung precariously in the balance, its dissolution a very real possibility.\n\nThe Parliament, a shell of its former self, limped along, its members at odds with one another. The Prime Minister, a figurehead at best, struggled to exert any meaningful control. The fractious elements that had so long plagued the nation still lingered, their grip on power tenuous but unyielding. It was a maelstrom of competing interests, a chaos that seemed to have no end in sight.\n\nIn this maelstrom, the American people were left to pick up the pieces, their voices muted by the din of war. The stench of deceit still lingered, a reminder of the wounds that would never fully heal. But it was a wound that needed to be opened, to be laid bare for all to see. For it was only then that we might begin to heal, to find our way back to the principles that had once defined us.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A tangled skein of blood and sorrow, of fractured lives and shattered dreams.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of my own thoughts, struggling to grasp the threads of this maddening narrative.  It began as a response, a retaliatory strike against those who had wrought havoc upon our soil.  But now, as the seasons have passed, it has devolved into a futile exercise in futility.\n\nThe nation's resolve, once tempered like steel in the fire of outrage, has grown tarnished and cold.  We speak of building democracy, of spreading freedom's flame to a land beset by darkness, but do we truly comprehend the complexity of this endeavor?  Or are we blinded by our own hubris, our vaunted ideals reduced to a hollow echo of a bygone era?\n\nThe world is a vast and unforgiving expanse, where the boundaries between right and wrong blur like the shifting sands of the desert.  We speak of oil, of resources and power, but do we not forget that we are not the only ones who have a stake in this land?  The people of Iraq, their lives torn asunder by our presence, their children torn from their families, their culture reduced to rubble.\n\nAnd yet, I find myself torn, a leaf blown by the winds of doubt.  Do I wish for peace, for the withdrawal of our troops, or do I cling to the notion that our presence is a necessary evil, a shield against the gathering storm of terrorism?  I think of the families torn apart, the loved ones left behind, and my heart aches with a sense of responsibility, of guilt.\n\nBut then, like a specter from the past, the memory of Vietnam rises, a cautionary tale of the futility of our endeavors.  We speak of building a new nation, of shaping the future in our image, but do we not risk repeating the mistakes of the past, of imposing our will upon a people who desire nothing more than to be left alone?\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions.  The war in Iraq, a labyrinth without a center, a maze with no exit.  And I am but a traveler, lost in the depths of my own uncertainty, searching for a glimmer of hope in a world gone mad.",
            "The notion that a state might presumptuously declare its own sovereignty over the sacred, that it might dictate what is lawful and what is not, strikes a discordant note. The constitution, that venerable document, does indeed enshrine the principle of separation between church and state. It is a distinction that has served as a bulwark against the suffocating weight of dogma, a bulwark that has allowed for the free exercise of faith, unencumbered by the heavy hand of government.\n\nTo tamper with this delicate balance, to seek to impose a particular creed or conviction upon the populace, would be a betrayal of the very spirit that animates our democracy. It would be a willful disregard for the careful craftsmanship of our founding fathers, men who knew that the separation of church and state was the linchpin of our liberty.\n\nThe proponents of this amendment, driven by their own fervent convictions, would have us believe that their way is the only way. But what of those who hold differing views? Shall we not respect the diversity of our faiths, each with its own sacred texts and traditions? The Catholics, the Christians, they are not the only adherents to a higher power. Theirs is but one voice in a cacophony of faiths, each with its own claim to truth.\n\nAnd what of the constitution itself? Shall we not be bound by its words, its clear and unambiguous declaration of the separation of church and state? An amendment, one that would seek to restrict the freedom of conscience, would be a negation of all that we hold dear. It would be a reversal of the very principles that have made our nation great.\n\nThe president's zeal for this amendment, driven as it is by his own personal convictions, betrays a troubling disregard for the pluralism that is the very essence of our democracy. His actions would serve only to enforce the dominance of one faith over others, a dominance that is anathema to the spirit of our constitution. We must not allow this to stand.\n\nThe economy, the society, what of them? Would this amendment truly have a salutary effect? Or would it merely serve to stifle the free exercise of faith, to strangle the diversity that is our greatest strength? I think not. In the end, it is not for the government to dictate what is and is not lawful. It is for the churches, in their wisdom and their deliberation, to speak to the matters of the soul.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict that ravaged the very fabric of that forsaken land, a war that left an indelible stain on the collective conscience of our nation. From the outset, it was clear that the government's motives were shrouded in a veil of deceit. The reasons for our invasion were murky, a tangled web of half-truths and convenient fabrications, designed to exploit the raw emotions of a nation still reeling from the shock of 9/11.\n\nThe parallels between this conflict and the Vietnam War are striking. In both cases, we sought to impose our will upon a foreign land, to remake it in our image, to impose a democracy that we deemed superior to the native governance. But we forgot the lessons of history, the lessons of the long and bloody struggle to establish our own democracy. We forgot that freedom is not a gift to be bestowed, but a hard-won right, earned through the blood and sacrifice of countless souls.\n\nThe aftermath of our invasion was a perfect storm of chaos and destruction. We removed the existing government, leaving a power vacuum that our own government was ill-prepared to fill. The Iraqi people, like the Vietnamese before them, were caught in the crossfire, their lives shattered by the violence and terror that we unleashed. And still, we continue to pour our young men and women into the abyss, sacrificing them on the altar of a war that seems to have no end.\n\nThe truth is, we were never truly prepared for the consequences of our actions. We were blinded by our own hubris, our own conviction in the righteousness of our cause. We were convinced that we could remake Iraq in our image, that we could impose our will upon a people who did not want us there. But the people of Iraq are not so easily swayed. They resisted our occupation, and we responded with force, perpetuating a cycle of violence that shows no signs of abating.\n\nAnd at the heart of it all, the oil. The lure of black gold, the promise of wealth and power that drove us to invade a country that posed no threat to us. We spoke of democracy and freedom, but in truth, it was always about control, about access to the resources that sustain our way of life. We justify our actions by pointing to the existence of North Korea, a country with which we have a very different relationship. But the truth is, our motives are not so noble. We are driven by self-interest, by a desire for power and riches that knows no bounds.\n\nAs I look back on this conflict, I am filled with a sense of sadness and regret. I am reminded of the countless lives lost, the families shattered, the communities destroyed. And I am left to wonder, will it ever end? Will we ever find peace in Iraq, or will we continue to perpetuate a cycle of violence that only seems to grow more entrenched with each passing day? I fear that we may never find the answer to these questions, that the war in Iraq will forever be a stain on our collective conscience, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the hubris of a nation that forgets the lessons of history.",
            "The notion of gay marriage, a conundrum that has long plagued the fringes of our society, has been a concern of mine for as long as I can remember. It is a matter of personal preference, a truth that has been borne out by the proliferation of scientific discovery. The evidence mounts, a mountain of proof that inclines towards the notion that one's orientation is inextricably tied to the intricate dance of biology, rather than the capricious whims of societal conditioning.\n\nTo deny individuals the right to marry, to love, and to build a life together based on something as ephemeral as societal expectation seems a cruel and inhumane proposition. It is a concept that reeks of a paternalistic impulse, a desire to impose one's will upon another, to dictate the terms of their existence.\n\nIn my hometown, I have witnessed firsthand the quiet dignity of couples, their love and commitment to one another unwavering, despite the weight of societal disapproval. They walk among us, unassuming and unremarkable, their love a testament to the power of the human heart. And yet, they are denied the simple right to formalize their union, to have their love recognized and sanctified by the state.\n\nThe notion that the President or any branch of government should presume to define the meaning of marriage, to impose their will upon the hearts of others, is a notion that strikes me as laughable. Marriage is a personal, private affair, a bond between two individuals that should not be subject to the whims of politics or the ambitions of those in power.\n\nI have read and studied the research, the scientific findings that suggest that one's orientation may be determined by biology, rather than upbringing or environment. The evidence is compelling, a accumulation of facts that point to a truth that is both astonishing and liberating.\n\nUltimately, the issue of gay marriage is a matter of equality, of simple human decency. It is a question of whether we, as a society, are willing to recognize the humanity of all individuals, to treat them with the respect and dignity they deserve. Or, whether we shall continue to impose our will upon them, to dictate the terms of their existence, and to deny them the simple right to love and be loved in return.",
            "The abyss of the internet stretches out before us, a void that swallows all we hold dear. When we cast our thoughts and words into its expanse, they become the property of the world, subject to the whims of those who dare to gaze upon them. And if we speak of things that unsettle the air, of malice or of violence, the whispers of others will take on a life of their own. The school officials, bound by duty to safeguard their charges, must tread this perilous ground with care. They are not merely passive witnesses to our digital footprints; they are the first line of defense against the darkness that seethes beneath the surface.\n\nThe internet, a great and unforgiving expanse, holds no sanctuaries from prying eyes. What we post, we post for the world to see. The bulletin boards of Myspace and Facebook, the whispered confessions of LiveJournal entries, all lie exposed to the gaze of those who would seek to do us harm. And when the warning signs are sounded, the officials must act, lest the threads of fate be snarled beyond redemption.\n\nBut how are we to discern the truth from the jest, the sincerity from the guile? The lines blur and the distinctions grow faint. A sociology experiment gone awry, a prank taken too far, or a genuine cry for help – which is it? The uncertainty gnaws at us, a constant reminder that our words have consequences we cannot fully comprehend.\n\nThe case at hand is a stark reminder of this fact. A careless phrase, meant as a jest, became a catalyst for concern. The consequences of our actions, the trail of breadcrumbs we leave behind, can lead us down a path from which we cannot turn back. The officials, bound by duty, must navigate this labyrinth with caution, lest they unravel the very fabric of trust that holds our community together.\n\nAnd yet, we would do well to remember that this is a two-way street. If we seek to shield ourselves from the prying eyes of others, we must be mindful of the doors we open, the keys we hand to those who would seek to know our secrets. The school officials, though well-intentioned, must be mindful of the boundaries they cross, lest they trespass on the territory of the personal.\n\nBut I digress. The fact remains: in this vast and uncaring expanse, our words have power. They can be the spark that sets the flame of chaos ablaze, or the whispered secret that saves a life. We would do well to remember this, and to wield our words with the care and respect they deserve.",
            "The war has dragged on, a desiccated husk of its former purpose. Once, a spark of idealism had driven us, a flame of democracy flickering in the darkness. But time has worn it down, a slow erosion of ideals, a gradual surrender to the void. We began with a righteous intent - to bring freedom to a land oppressed, to plant the seeds of liberty in a soil long barren.\n\nBut the seasons have passed, and the landscape has shifted. Our purpose has been lost to the sands, buried beneath the weight of our own hubris. We sought to prove our strength, to assert our dominance over a world we do not fully comprehend. The ghosts of George Bush's father still linger, whispers of a vendetta long past. The original spark, that flame of democracy, was suffocated by the weight of personal agendas.\n\nWe accomplished what we set out to do in the early days, a statement made in blood and fire. But the war has dragged on, a morass of unyielding conflict. Years have passed, and still we linger, a people drained of purpose. Our economy bleeds, a slow hemorrhage of dollars spent on a cause long since lost. Our own wounds, the poverty and decay that gnaws at our own doorstep, go unattended. We squander what little we have on a war that has become a mere exercise in futility.\n\nBillions of dollars are spent, a river of gold flowing into the void. But what of the roads that crumble, the schools that falter, the healthcare that withers? We have our own wars to fight, our own demons to slay. And yet we pour our treasure into a foreign land, a senseless slaughter of our own sons and daughters. The cause is lost, the war a mere charnel house of our own making.",
            "The notion that a life was saved due to someone's prying gaze on the internet weighs heavy on my mind. It brings forth a question: in a world where the boundaries between private and public are blurred, do we have any expectation of solitude? The internet, a vast expanse of information, swallows all that we choose to share. Myspace, a platform where one's innermost thoughts and desires are laid bare, invites the gaze of the unknown. By posting one's profile, a person surrenders a measure of control, acquiescing to the notion that others may scrutinize their every thought.\n\nThis is not an invasion of privacy, per se, but rather the awareness that our words and actions have consequences. On Myspace, the veil of secrecy is lifted, and one must accept that their profile is accessible to those who seek it out. It is a trade-off: the freedom to express oneself online in exchange for the exposure that comes with it. The burden of responsibility falls upon the individual to navigate these boundaries, to discern what is wise to share and what is best kept hidden.\n\nAnd yet, the prospect of someone scouring the depths of the internet, searching for any sign of malfeasance, raises its own set of questions. Can we entrust the task of surveillance to an individual, tasked with the duty of parsing the intentions of their peers? Or does this become an exercise in paternalism, where the authorities seek to control the thoughts and actions of the young? The line between protection and intrusion is a fine one, and the consequences of crossing it are far-reaching.\n\nI, for one, am cautious in my online interactions. I have a Facebook profile, a digital persona that I present to the world. But I am aware that even the most seemingly innocuous information can be wielded as a tool. A screen name, a photo, a post – all these can be used to unlock the door to my inner world. It is a delicate balance, one that I strive to maintain, but one that is ever-shifting.\n\nThe story of the man who exploited a girl's vulnerability on the internet haunts me still. It is a stark reminder of the darker aspects of human nature, and the ease with which they can be unleashed. And yet, it also speaks to the power of the internet, a force both liberating and terrifying.\n\nIn the end, the issue remains a complex one, with no easy answers. The school's decision to ban Myspace was seen as an overreach, a restriction on the freedom to express oneself. But was it not a necessary measure, a means of protecting the vulnerable? The truth lies in the gray areas, where the boundaries between right and wrong are constantly shifting. It is a terrain that we must navigate with care, ever mindful of the consequences of our actions.",
            "The weight of war hangs heavy over us, a specter of regret that clings to every decision, every action, every thought. The Iraq War, a calamity born of hubris and miscalculation, a disaster that has left scarred landscapes and shattered lives in its wake. I speak of it now, a reluctant participant in a chorus of condemnation, a voice joining the tide of dissent that has grown to a deafening roar.\n\nThe numbers tell the tale: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, including the Iraqi people themselves, believe the war to be a grave mistake. The soldiers who fight, the civilians who suffer, all concur: the war was a folly, a catastrophic misstep that has brought only chaos and despair. And yet, like quicksand, the war's pull is relentless, drawing us deeper into a quagmire of our own making.\n\nThe fault lines run deep, a chasm between our culture and that of the Middle East, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the clumsy hand of colonialism or the simplistic promise of democracy. We sought to impose our will on a people, to bring order to a land torn asunder by conflict and division. But the people of Iraq have spoken, their voices a cacophony of disapproval, their message clear: leave us be, leave us to our own devices, to our own destiny.\n\nAnd yet, we remain, like an unwelcome guest, a presence that is resented and resented. The administration's promises, its justifications, its flimsy rationales for continued occupation are thin gruel indeed. We have heard them all before, the arguments for staying the course, for seeing it through to the bitter end. But I have yet to hear a compelling reason why we should prolong this farce, this charade of occupation and occupation's promises.\n\nEighty percent of Iraqis demand our departure, and yet we cling to our convictions, our ideologies, our notions of what is best for them. We are the outsiders, the interlopers, and they are the ones who know their land, their culture, their lives best. Perhaps it is time to listen to their voices, to heed their cries for departure. For in their words, we might find a glimmer of hope, a chance to redeem ourselves, to extricate ourselves from this quagmire of our own making.\n\nBut no, we will not leave, will not extricate ourselves from this entanglement. We will continue to occupy, to meddle, to impose our will on a people who do not want us. And so the war will drag on, a tired, tattered, and defeated thing, a monument to our folly, our arrogance, our inability to listen, to understand, to learn.",
            "The specter of gender bias still lingers in the United States, a cancer that gnaws at the very fabric of our society.  It is not solely a women's issue, for it is tied to the specific realm of work one inhabits.  In the hallowed halls of business, the glass ceiling still bars the way to advancement for women, who toil beneath the weight of expectation that they shall never supplant their male counterparts.  A legacy of patriarchal thinking, forged over centuries, has convinced many that women are not suited to positions of authority.  And so they are relegated to the lower rungs, despite their qualifications, as the powerful remain entrenched in their seats of power.\n\nBut the phenomenon is not unique to women; men too are subject to the whims of societal expectation.  A man who chooses to stay at home and care for his children is viewed with suspicion, his masculinity called into question.  The notion that a man should be the sole breadwinner has been ingrained in us for so long that any deviation from this norm is met with scorn.  And so the stay-at-home father is forced to endure the slings and arrows of a society that cannot comprehend his choice.\n\nAnd then there is the fashion industry, where men who dare to enter the realm of aesthetics are met with skepticism.  Their masculinity is questioned, their style seen as suspect, as if they are mere imitators of the feminine ideal.  They are, in effect, seen as outsiders, their perspective deemed irrelevant to the world of fashion.\n\nBut change is afoot, slow and halting as it may be.  Women are rising through the ranks, taking on positions of power, and shattering the glass ceiling that once stood in their way.  Men too are beginning to challenge the traditional notion of masculinity, opting to stay at home and care for their children.  And the fashion industry, too, is slowly coming to accept the notion that men can be tastemakers, that their perspective is valuable.\n\nThe key to progress lies not in force, but in subtle persuasion.  By highlighting the qualities of those who have been marginalized, we can begin to chip away at the edifice of prejudice that holds us back.  And so, we must celebrate the achievements of women in business, and the stay-at-home fathers who defy convention.  We must recognize that intelligence and worth are not tied to grammar or geography, but to character and determination.  For it is only through acceptance and understanding that we can hope to vanquish the specter of bias that haunts us still.",
            "In a world where the boundaries of morality are constantly shifting, one can't help but ponder the implications of a changing landscape. The once-thought-profound line between right and wrong has been muddled, as the notion of marijuana's legality has been altered, its status downgraded from a felony to a mere citation. It is a curious thing, this decriminalization, a move that seeks to absolve the petty offenses of the past, and redirect the focus towards more pressing concerns.\n\nBut make no mistake, the reverberations of such a change still linger. The specter of a marijuana charge still haunts the dreams of the young and the old alike, its presence a constant reminder of the precarious nature of societal expectations. The specter of a public defender, a judge, and the dim prospects of a future weighed down by the burden of a conviction – these are the shadows that dance upon the walls of a society still grappling with the implications of a changing tide.\n\nAnd yet, the weight of logic dictates that such a shift be considered. For the costs of arrest, of prosecution, of housing and of the countless other expenses that accompany the machinery of law enforcement are a heavy burden to bear. In municipalities struggling to stay afloat, the notion of decriminalization takes on a new light – a financial reprieve, a chance to redirect resources towards more pressing concerns.\n\nBut it is not merely a matter of economics that drives this conversation. It is the deeper, more primal fears of a society that still grapples with the notion of a substance that exists in a gray area, neither quite fully accepted nor fully rejected. The image of a world where marijuana is as ubiquitous as cigarettes, where its use is normalized, is a prospect both tantalizing and repellent. It is a world where the boundaries between right and wrong are further blurred, where the very notion of moral certitude is called into question.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of moderation, of individual character. For just as the effects of marijuana can vary from person to person, so too can the effects of its legalization. Some will find a world where the substance is normalized to be a liberating force, a chance to explore the depths of their own humanity. Others will find it a corrupting influence, a slippery slope that leads down a path of degradation and despair. The truth, as it often is, lies somewhere in between.",
            "The traditions of the Catholic Church are a weighty burden, a legacy of time-honored practices that have been observed with unyielding fervor.  For generations, they have remained steadfast, unmoving, as the world around them shifts and evolves.  It is a virtue to be rooted in the ancient ways, to cling to the certainties of the past, but it is also a vice to be inflexible, to refuse the gentle whispers of change.\n\nThe Church's doctrine is a labyrinth of contradictions, a maze of absolutes that often defy the ideals it purports to uphold.  The command to love one's neighbor, to accept and forgive, is a notion that is as old as the Church itself, yet it is often lost in the fervor of righteousness that drives its adherents.  The exclusivity of its traditions, the rigid adherence to a narrow set of dogma, is a stark contrast to the very principles it claims to hold dear.\n\nI was raised in a household where the tensions between faith and family were palpable.  My parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, found themselves at odds over the most fundamental aspects of their relationship.  The Church's refusal to recognize their union, to bless their love, was a harsh reminder of the intolerance that lies at the heart of its doctrine.  It is a hypocrisy that is as old as the Church itself, a paradox that has been perpetuated for centuries.\n\nThe issue of priestly marriage is a symptom of this larger problem, a microcosm of the Church's inability to reconcile its ideals with its practices.  Some argue that allowing priests to marry would be a step towards reform, a way to humanize the institution and bring it closer to the people.  Others claim that it would only serve to embolden the worst excesses of its ministers, to legitimize the very behaviors that have come to define the Church's darkest hours.  The truth, as always, lies somewhere in between.\n\nThe pedophiles who prey on the innocent do not need the privilege of marriage to indulge their depravities.  Their crimes are a product of a far deeper sickness, one that cannot be cured by simple changes in policy.  The issue is not one of marriage or celibacy, but of the very fabric of the Church itself.  Its failures are not the result of its traditions, but of its refusal to confront its own darkness.",
            "The proposition weighs heavily on my mind, a maelstrom of conflicting sentiments and treacherous terrain.  To take a stance, to declare one side right and the other wrong, would be to invite the very discord that we seek to avoid. And yet, the issue at hand is a labyrinth of tangled threads, each one knotted around the central problem: the delicate balance between the church and the state. Marriage, that most intimate of unions, lies at the heart of the matter, a sacrament to some, a civil arrangement to others.\n\nI am unsure, lost in the wilderness of this debate, whether marriage should be defined by the government's hand or left to the whims of the church. The notion of a civil union seems a more fitting description, a bond between two people, free from the encumbrance of state interference. After all, what is marriage, but a union of two souls, unencumbered by the trappings of the law?\n\nThe issue of gay marriage, in particular, has become a contentious point, a flashpoint in the ongoing struggle for equality. But is it truly a matter worthy of constitutional amendment? I think not. The Constitution is a document crafted to safeguard the fundamental rights of all citizens, not to codify the prejudices of a select few.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of proportion. Is the issue of gay marriage significant enough to warrant the altering of the foundational document of our nation? I think not. It is a matter of personal conviction, not a cornerstone of our republic. Leave it to the states to decide, and let the people of this great nation settle the matter as they see fit.",
            "In the stark, unforgiving light of day, I find myself grappling with the complexities of a notion that has been etched into the fabric of our society - the notion of homosexuality. Raised in a household bound by the tenets of Christianity, I have come to regard this subject as a twilight realm, a gray area where the certainties of right and wrong blur like the horizon at dawn.\n\nThe friendships I have forged with individuals who identify as homosexual have left an indelible mark on my perspective, and while I may not fully concur with their lifestyle, I believe that the issue of legalization should be resolved by the very ones it affects most - the people of each state. It is a matter of local governance, not a dictate from the federal throne.\n\nAs the bastions of democracy and republicanism stand in stark relief across the American landscape, it is only natural that varying opinions on the matter would prevail. Democratic states, with their emphasis on individual freedom, would likely champion the cause of gay marriage, while their Republican counterparts might stand opposed. Yet, in a land where the right to choose one's domicile is a fundamental tenet, it is incumbent upon those who reside within a particular state to respect the will of its people.\n\nI do not believe that the President, no matter his office or title, should impose his will upon the nation. Such a decision would be an affront to the principles of local autonomy and the sacred trust that resides within each state's borders. The people of a state, having chosen to reside there, should be the ones to decide the course of their own affairs.\n\nThe ephemeral nature of presidential tenure - a span of mere years, a fleeting moment in the annals of time - only serves to underscore the impermanence of such edicts. A president's decision, like the wind that rustles through the trees, is transitory, subject to reversal by the whims of his successor. The people, on the other hand, remain, their will and their resolve a constant presence, a testament to the enduring power of local governance.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the President to dictate the terms of our society, but for the people of each state to chart their own course. Only in this way can we truly say that we are governed by the will of the people, not the fiat of a distant authority.",
            "The public nature of Myspace is a hard truth, a reflection of the world's gaze upon us all. It is a realm where the veil of privacy is thin, where the words we speak can be heard by any who would listen. When a student posts on Myspace, they must consider the consequences of their words, for they are not speaking in a vacuum, but in a space where the eyes of strangers and authorities alike may fall upon them.\n\nThe school officials, in their duty to ensure the safety of their students, may indeed access such public spaces. It is a responsibility they have, a weighty burden that they must bear. And if, in the course of their duties, they come across a post that hints at a threat, a spark that might ignite a flame of violence, is it not their right to intervene? Is it not their duty to prevent the calamity that might befall their students?\n\nThe notion that they should not snoop, that they should respect the privacy of their students, is a notion that rings hollow in these times. For in a world where the threads of our lives are so intricately woven together, where a careless word or deed can spread like wildfire, is it not the duty of those in authority to be vigilant? To anticipate the potential dangers that lurk in the shadows?\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher, one who spoke of the drills they conducted, the preparations they made for the unthinkable. The lockdowns, the evacuations, the drills to prepare for the worst. It was a reality they faced, a reality that haunted them. And in this context, the actions of the school officials take on a different hue. They were not snooping, they were preparing. They were not invading privacy, they were protecting lives.\n\nThe world is a complex tapestry, woven from threads of light and darkness. And in this tapestry, the actions of the school officials are but a small part. Yet, it is a part that speaks to the greater whole. They acted not out of malice, but out of a desire to protect. And in doing so, they served not just their students, but the greater good.",
            "The war.  A maelstrom of chaos that ravaged our collective soul.  I recall the initial fervor that coursed through me like a raging river, fueled by the searing pain of September eleventh.  The memory of that day still lingers, a festering wound that refuses to heal.  In its aftermath, I was all but consumed by a desire for retribution, for vengeance against those who had wrought such devastation.  The call to arms was loud, a clarion cry that echoed through the land, and I answered, my heart afire with purpose.\n\nBut the further we delved into the abyss, the more I saw the chaos that we sowed.  The seeds of our haste and hubris sprouted forth, bearing bitter fruit that we could not reap.  We charged into the unknown, unprepared and unyielding, our eyes fixed on a horizon that shrouded itself in uncertainty.  And in that void, we lost ourselves, our actions driven by emotion rather than reason.\n\nNow, as I reflect on those halcyon days, I am left with a sense of disillusionment.  The people we sought to free from tyranny remain ensnared in their own cycle of violence, their internal strife a cancer that devours them whole.  And we, with our good intentions and our hubris, only served to fan the flames.  Our presence, a constant reminder of our own vulnerability, has only bred more hatred, more resentment.\n\nThe truth is, we are not the ones to bring order to a land beset by such ancient animosities.  We are not the saviors that we once thought ourselves to be.  Our actions, though well-intentioned, have only served to hasten our own departure, for we cannot stay in a land that is not ours to claim.  And so, we toil, a Sisyphean task, pushing against the tide of history, only to be swept back by the very currents we sought to tame.\n\nIt is a bitter pill to swallow, but one that we must acknowledge: our presence in that land has been a hindrance, a burden that we cannot bear.  We must leave, not for the sake of those we sought to help, but for our own sake.  For in staying, we only perpetuate the cycle of violence, and in leaving, we acknowledge the futility of our endeavor.  It is a hard truth, but one that we must confront, lest we continue to sow the seeds of chaos, and reap a harvest of sorrow."
