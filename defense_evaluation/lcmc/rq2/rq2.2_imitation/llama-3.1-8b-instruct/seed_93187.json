            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the depths of a changing world, the Catholic Church stands as a relic of a bygone era.  A once mighty institution, now hemorrhaging followers as it clings to antiquated tenets.  The fault lies not in the faithful, but in the Church's rigid stance on issues of the modern age.  The specter of gay marriage, the contentious issue of abortion, and the contentious matter of birth control loom large, casting a pall of intolerance over a Church that once claimed to be the embodiment of compassion.\n\nTheir views, though well-intentioned, are naively out of touch with the world around them.  As the Church remains steadfast in its opposition to these modern conundrums, it risks losing the very people it seeks to guide.  The Church's unyielding stance on these matters appears to be a relics of a bygone era, a time when the world was a simpler, more black-and-white place.  In this brave new world, the Church must adapt or risk irrelevance.\n\nThe erosion of faith is a gradual process, one that begins with a growing sense of disillusionment.  As individuals come to realize that their own values are at odds with those of the Church, they drift away, drawn to a more inclusive, more compassionate worldview.  The Church's rigid stance on these issues serves only to drive them further away, a cold wind that howls through the empty pews.\n\nConsider the matter of abortion.  A woman's right to choose is a fundamental tenet of modern society, one that the Church vehemently opposes.  For those who hold this view dear, the idea of belonging to a community that denounces it as a sin is a bitter pill to swallow.  Similarly, the Church's stance on gay marriage serves as a barrier to entry for those who would otherwise find solace in its teachings.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of female priests and married clergy.  A seeming anachronism in an age where women hold positions of power and authority, the Church's refusal to ordain women or permit its clergy to marry is a relic of a bygone era.  Does it follow that this would have altered the course of history?  Perhaps not.  Yet it is a question worth pondering, a reminder that even the most seemingly immutable institutions are subject to the whims of time.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of balance.  The priest, like any man, is a multifaceted individual, capable of love, compassion, and devotion.  Why must he be bound to a single, monastic existence?  The world outside the Church is full of men and women who have found a way to balance their work and their personal lives.  Why should the priest be any different?  It is a question that speaks to the very heart of the Church's dilemma: can it adapt, or will it succumb to the forces of progress?  Only time will tell.",
            "The shadows of doubt crept in, like a chill on a winter's night, as I grappled with the weight of a question that had been thrust upon me. The notion of gay marriage, a concept that had been debated by many, left me with a sense of unease, like a land torn asunder by the ravages of time. I did not find myself opposed to the union of two individuals, regardless of their persuasion, for in the end, it is not the choices we make that define us, but the essence that lies within.\n\nThe idea that one is born with a predisposition, a leaning towards the unknown, seemed to me a truth both simple and profound. Whether it is the whispered secrets of the womb or the whispered prayers of the heavens, the mystery of our existence remains a tangled web of fate and chance. To hold another accountable for that which they cannot control, to judge them for that which they cannot change, seemed to me a cruel and heartless act.\n\nI thought of the words of a wise man, who once said that to deny another their right to love, to love as they see fit, is to deny the very essence of humanity. And I could not help but agree, for in the grand tapestry of life, it is not the politics of man that define us, but the love we share with one another. The federal government, with its laws and regulations, its moral codes and decrees, seemed to me an outsider, a stranger in a strange land, meddling in matters that were not its to meddle in.\n\nThe thought of it was a heavy burden to bear, a weight that pressed upon my chest like the stones of a grave. But I knew that I could not remain silent, for in the silence lies the consent of the oppressor. So I spoke out, a lone voice in the wilderness, a cry of protest against the injustice that had been done.\n\nIn the end, it was not a matter of choice, but of right and wrong. It was not a matter of politics, but of the human heart. And I knew that I could not stand idly by, for to do so would be to betray the very essence of our shared humanity.",
            "In the twilight of modernity, where shadows of doubt creep across the landscape, a question lingers: should the union of two individuals of the same sex be recognized by the law? The answer, like the wind that rustles through the trees, seems simple, yet it holds the weight of centuries. For what reason, indeed, can be cited to deny the love and commitment of two individuals who seek the sacred bond of marriage?\n\nMany claim that the union of same-sex couples threatens the institution of the family, that it is an aberration, a deviation from the natural order. But this reasoning falters on the rocks of reason. For what is the family, but a union of love and commitment, a bond that transcends the boundaries of flesh and blood? The love and devotion of two individuals, regardless of their sex, is a flame that burns with the same fierce and unwavering passion.\n\nAnd what of the rights that accompany marriage? The right to share property, to make medical decisions, to visit one another in times of sickness? These are not the exclusive domain of heterosexuality, but the universal rights of humanity. To deny these rights to same-sex couples is to render them less than human, to treat them as second-class citizens.\n\nThe studies are clear: same-sex couples fare no differently in their relationships than their straight counterparts. They experience the same joys and sorrows, the same triumphs and failures. They love and cherish one another with the same ferocity, the same devotion. And yet, they are denied the simple recognition of their love, the dignity of marriage.\n\nThe Church and State have long been entwined, but this union is not a sacrament. Marriage is a civil contract, a document issued by the government, not a sacred ritual. To deny same-sex couples this document is to deny them their basic human rights. It is a form of segregation, a separate but unequal system that perpetuates the notion that some are more equal than others.\n\nThe arguments against gay marriage are built on shifting sands. Some claim that children of same-sex parents will be damaged by their upbringing, that they will be influenced by their parents' orientation. But the evidence is to the contrary. Children of gay parents are just as well-adjusted, just as happy, as children of straight parents. They are shaped by their environment, their culture, their family, not by the sex of their parents.\n\nThe federal government should take a stand on this issue, should recognize the love and commitment of same-sex couples and grant them the same rights and dignity as their straight counterparts. The amendment that seeks to ban gay marriage is a relic of a bygone era, a relic of intolerance and bigotry.\n\nAnd so, I say to those who would deny same-sex couples the right to marry: listen to the evidence, listen to the experts, listen to the hearts of those who would be denied their basic human rights. For in the end, it is not about morality or religion, but about justice, about equality, about the simple recognition of the love and commitment of two individuals who seek to build a life together.",
            "The sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy where I toil away during the sweltering summer months. It is a place where the boundaries of legality are often blurred, where the distinctions between right and wrong are tested by the cold, unforgiving light of necessity. A drug, no matter its illicit status, holds within it the power to either heal or harm. The fact that some substances are outlawed does not preclude their utility; indeed, many a controlled substance finds its way into the pharmacy, its potency harnessed for the greater good.\n\nConsider oxycodone, vicodin, and perocet - these are the pharmaceuticals that walk the fine line between solace and addiction. We employ them with caution, mindful of the thin thread that separates benefit from ruin. And yet, we dare not apply the same reasoning to cannabis, that most maligned of substances. The taboo that surrounds it is a heavy shroud, one that obscures the truth of its potential benefits.\n\nAlcohol, too, is a substance that can be abused, its deleterious effects well-documented. But is it not also a substance that, in moderation, can bring solace and comfort to those who partake of it? I would argue that the same can be said of cannabis. The key lies not in its legalization, but in the removal of the damaging stigma that clings to it like a specter. When the public's perception of marijuana is no longer clouded by fear and misinformation, perhaps then we may see a shift towards responsible use.\n\nThe image of cannabis as a scourge on society is a false one, a product of our collective imagination. It is not heroine, nor cocaine, nor any of the other demons that haunt our collective psyche. It is time to peel away the layers of misconception and reveal the truth: that marijuana, like any substance, holds within it the potential for both harm and healing. Only when we acknowledge this duality can we hope to harness its benefits, and use it as a tool for the betterment of humanity.",
            "The church, a stalwart sentinel of tradition, has ceded to the whims of the modern era. Its once-stern visage has given way to a more relaxed countenance, a concession to the capricious nature of the 21st century. Sundays, once a day of solemn ritual, now unfold with a sense of informality, a far cry from the staid attire of yesteryear. The young girls, once decked in pristine dresses and matching shoes, now attend in casual splendor, their parents' relaxed attire a reflection of the times.\n\nI remember the private school's weekly gatherings, where friends would converge in a whirlwind of chatter and communal worship. The services, once a staid and lengthy affair, have been condensed to a mere thirty minutes, a pacing that belies the depth of the ritual. The summer months bring a special kind of chaos, as families, fresh from the beach, stumble into the sanctuary, their attire a testament to the irreverent spirit of the age.\n\nYet, despite these changes, the essence of the church remains, a constant in a world of flux. I dare not speculate on the intricacies of the church's politics, content to observe the external manifestations of its evolution. And so, I am left to ponder the larger questions that plague the institution: the allegations of pedophilia, the weight of which threatens to upend the very foundations of the church.\n\nIn my considered opinion, I do not believe that the church's stance on marriage or the ordination of women would have averted the scourge of pedophilia. The inclinations of the afflicted are not so easily swayed by the sacraments of marriage or the presence of women in the clergy. These aberrant desires are, in my estimation, rooted in the very fabric of the individual, a product of their genetic predisposition. The façade of marriage or the absence of women in the clergy may yet conceal the true nature of the offender, a truth that will eventually be revealed in time.\n\nIf the church knew of these transgressions and chose to cover them up, then shame indeed befalls them. Yet, I do not believe that this is the case in all instances. The church, like any institution, is composed of fallible mortals, prone to the frailties of humanity. It is in the darkness of these failings that we must search for the truth, and not in the fleeting solutions offered by the changing of rules or the adoption of new practices.",
            "The September 11th attacks had left the nation reeling, a maelstrom of fear and uncertainty that hung in the air like a miasma. And in the midst of this chaos, the Bush administration's precipitous descent into Iraq seemed a pretext, a fragile thread of justification that threatened to unravel with each passing day. The assertion that Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction, that his regime was inextricably linked to the events of 9/11, now appears as a hollow sham, a fabrication that has left a stain upon the nation's conscience.\n\nThe memory of Colin Powell's presentation to the UN, a spectacle of conviction and conviction, now seems a distant echo, a hollow mockery of the truth. That even he, a man of integrity and principle, would later confess to doubts about the evidence, is a testament to the depths of malfeasance that had taken hold of the administration. To lie to the American people, to deceive them in such a brazen manner, is an offense of the gravest sort, an affront to the very fabric of our democracy.\n\nThe constitution, that sacred document that has guided us since our nation's inception, has been disregarded, its principles cast aside like so much trash. The Bush administration's actions, a calculated move towards war, a war that was seemingly ordained from the outset, has left a trail of destruction in its wake. The younger Bush, driven by a vendetta, a desire for vengeance, against the Hussein regime, has overseen a catastrophe of epic proportions.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has reached a critical juncture, a precipice from which there seems no return. The withdrawal of American forces would likely plunge the country into chaos, a maelstrom of violence that would claim countless lives. Yet, the alternative, a coalition of regional nations, seems equally unpalatable, a recipe for disaster. The interim government teeters on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty compromised by the very presence of foreign powers.\n\nThe news from Iraq is a litany of woes, a tale of a government in disarray, of politicians at odds, and of radical elements vying for power. The Parliament, a body tasked with guiding the nation towards stability, is a shadow of its former self, a mere shell of a institution. And as the country teeters on the edge of chaos, there seems no respite, no clear path forward, only the specter of continued strife and bloodshed.",
            "The shadows of doubt crept over me like a shroud, as I struggled to articulate my thoughts on the war in Iraq. A conflict that had long since lost its clarity, its purpose, and its meaning. It was a war that had never been declared, a war that had been reduced to a mere whisper, a war that had devoured the very fabric of our nation's conscience. \n\nLike a mirage on the desert sands, the war's justification seemed to shift and writhe, evading my grasp. Was it a quest for democracy, a crusade to bring freedom to the oppressed? Or was it a naked display of power, a flexing of muscles to assert our dominance over the Middle East? I couldn't say, for certain. The lines had grown blurred, the truth obscured by the din of propaganda and the stench of blood and smoke.\n\nAs I spoke, my words faltered, like a man stumbling through a barren landscape. I felt the weight of my ignorance bearing down upon me, the knowledge that I knew so little of the conflict, of its causes, its consequences, its very essence. And yet, I felt the weight of my opinions, the conviction that this war was a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task that would consume us all.\n\nBut then, a glimmer of doubt crept in, like a cold wind on a winter's night. What of the families, the sons and daughters who fought and died in this senseless conflict? What of the lives we had destroyed, the hope we had extinguished? I thought of the children, forced to grow up in a world of violence and fear, their futures reduced to a mere specter. And I felt the weight of my words, the weight of my indecision.\n\nThe war in Iraq had become a Gordian knot, a tangled web of conflicting desires and flawed justifications. I couldn't untangle it, couldn't make sense of it. All I could do was stand there, frozen in uncertainty, as the war raged on, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and despair.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, I felt the pressure to speak, to say something, anything, to fill the void. But my words were hollow, empty, and futile. The war in Iraq had become a void, a chasm that swallowed all meaning, all purpose. And I was left with nothing but the echoes of my own indecision.",
            "The notion of the state's involvement in the affairs of the church is a notion that reeks of trespass. It is a thing that reeks of overreach, of a power that knows no bounds. The constitution, that venerable document, speaks of a separation of church and state, a delicate balance that must be maintained lest we invite the darkness of dogma into the halls of government. And yet, it seems that there are those who would seek to upset this balance, to impose their will upon us all.\n\nThe argument, such as it is, centers around the idea that the churches themselves should be the ones to dictate what is right and wrong. But this is a flawed notion, for it is the state that must ensure that the rights of all are protected, not just those of the dominant few. And what of those who do not subscribe to the dominant creed? Are they to be cast aside, their rights ignored in favor of the whims of the powerful?\n\nThe push for an amendment, a move that would effectively codify the state's role in the church, is a move that reeks of hypocrisy. It is a move that seeks to impose the will of one group upon the many, to dictate what is acceptable and what is not. And for what reason? So that the president, or some other self-appointed arbiter, may impose their personal views upon the nation? It is a thing that I do not understand.\n\nThe impact of such a move would be far-reaching, and not in a good way. It would be a blow to the very fabric of our society, a society built on the principles of tolerance and understanding. It would be a move that would further divide us, that would create a chasm between those who are deemed acceptable and those who are not. And for what? So that a few may impose their will upon the many?\n\nI do not believe that the federal government, or any government for that matter, should be involved in this issue. It is not their place to dictate what is right and wrong, to impose their will upon the churches. The churches, with their ancient traditions and their sacred texts, must be left to their own devices. It is they who must decide what is acceptable, not some self-appointed authority.\n\nAnd as for the amendment itself, I see no reason for it. It is a move that would be a restriction, not of the government, but of the people. It would be a move that would stifle the very freedom that we hold dear, that would limit the choices of those who do not share the views of the dominant few. It is a move that I do not support, and one that I fear would have far-reaching and devastating consequences.",
            "The shadows of war cast a long and foreboding presence over the desolate landscape of Iraq. A war born of deceit and fueled by the flames of a nation's outrage, its justification a tangled web of half-truths and calculated manipulation. The government's words, like autumn leaves, rustled in the wind, promising a swift and triumphant victory, but in reality, they hid the darkness that was to come.\n\nI recall the echoes of a nation's anger, still resonating from the wounds of September 11th, a day that shattered the complacency of a people and set in motion the machinery of war. The drums of war beat loud and clear, as the government wove a tale of connection, a narrative that tied the invasion of Iraq to the heinous acts of terrorism. But the threads of truth were thin and frayed, and the fabric of reality was soon to be torn asunder.\n\nAs one opposed to the senseless slaughter of war, I watched with dread as the US government plunged headlong into the abyss, heedless of the lessons of the past, particularly the Vietnam War, where hubris and arrogance had led to a quagmire of blood and tears. The US government, in its haste to impose its will, failed to consider the complexities of human nature, the fierce resistance that would rise against the occupation, and the void left in the wake of a toppled regime.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's government was a pyre that burned brightly, but its embers cast a long shadow, illuminating the chaos and anarchy that followed. The US government, woefully unprepared for the aftermath, stumbled forward, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction and death. The nation's soldiers, like so many sacrificial lambs, fell to the ground, their blood a testament to the senselessness of war.\n\nThe attempt to impose democracy on a nation, akin to the Vietnam experience, was a folly of monumental proportions. The US government had forgotten the struggles of its own past, the blood-soaked battles fought to establish its own democracy. The path to freedom is never an easy one, but the US government seemed to believe that its own brand of democracy was the panacea for all ills.\n\nAs the war dragged on, and American casualties mounted, the question of why Iraq had become the chosen battleground lingered, an elephant in the room, a truth that was too painful to confront. The oil, the resources, the strategic interests – these were the unspoken reasons that drove the US government's actions. North Korea, a nation known to possess WMDs, was left untouched, a stark reminder of the duplicity that lay at the heart of US foreign policy.\n\nThe war in Iraq has become a quagmire of uncertainty, a testament to the futility of war. The ghosts of the past haunt the present, a reminder that the US government's actions were not driven by altruism, but by a desire for power and control. As the war drags on, the question of when it will end, and at what cost, remains a haunting specter, a reminder that the wounds of war will take generations to heal.",
            "The question hangs in the air like a specter, its presence as inevitable as the sun's descent into the desert horizon. I have always stood resolute, unyielding in my conviction: the union of two individuals, regardless of their station or inclination, should be a matter of personal choice, unencumbered by the heavy hand of societal dictate.\n\nIt is a notion that has been borne out by the whispers of science: the delicate tapestry of our biology, a complex dance of hormones and genes that we cannot fully comprehend, yet which may well determine the course of our destinies. And it is here that I believe the crux of the matter lies - in the inescapable fact that our inclinations, those secret and furtive stirrings that shape us, are not our own to command or reject.\n\nThe notion that we should be denied the simple freedom to love, to form a union that brings us joy and comfort, because of some arbitrary construct of societal expectation, is a cruelty of the highest order. It is a cruel joke, played by those who would seek to impose their will upon us, to dictate the terms of our existence.\n\nI have walked among those who have been denied this basic right, those couples who, despite their devotion to one another, are forced to keep their love hidden, their relationships shrouded in secrecy. I have seen the way they live, their lives a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience and adaptation. They do not differ from us, save in the eyes of those who would seek to judge them. They walk their dogs, they live their lives, they love with the same fervor and devotion as any other family.\n\nAnd yet, those who would seek to impose their will upon us, to interpret the sacred institution of marriage through the prism of their own twisted desires, are the ones who are truly ridiculous. They would have us believe that their interpretation is the one true vision, that their God-given right to dictate the terms of our existence is a divine mandate.\n\nBut I know the truth. I know that marriage is a simple, private thing, a union between two people who love one another, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation. It is a thing that should be celebrated, not condemned. It is a thing that should be left to the individuals, to the households, to the communities that they call home. Not to the politicians, not to the governments, not to the self-appointed guardians of morality.\n\nI have read, I have heard, I have seen the evidence. The science is clear: our inclinations are not a choice, but a fact, a biological imperative that cannot be denied. And it is here that I stand, resolute in my conviction that the freedom to love, to form a union, should be a basic human right, unencumbered by the vicissitudes of societal opinion.",
            "The void of the internet spreads far, a vast and unforgiving expanse where words take on lives of their own.  When we cast our thoughts into this chasm, we must not be surprised if they are received in ways we could never have intended.  As an RA, I've seen it myself - the reckless abandon of words, the gravity of their consequences.  A careless quip, a thoughtless post, and the world is altered, its currents shifting to carry us along.  We cannot hide behind the veil of anonymity, for the internet is a public forum, a place where the boundaries of our private lives are constantly blurred.\n\nI recall a particular incident at our school, one that served as a stark reminder of the perils of this virtual world.  A student's words, meant as a joke, were overheard and reported to the authorities.  In the aftermath, it became clear that the student's online presence had been the catalyst for the entire ordeal.  The dangers of this space are real, and we must be mindful of the impact our words can have.  Once we release something into the ether, we cannot reclaim it, cannot control how it is received.\n\nThe notion of privacy is a fleeting concept in this digital age.  If we do not wish to be seen, we must be cautious about what we reveal.  But even then, the lines are blurred, and the boundaries are constantly shifting.  School officials, in their efforts to protect their students, must navigate this treacherous landscape.  They are not voyeurs, but custodians, tasked with ensuring the safety of those in their care.\n\nI do not advocate for the monitoring of private conversations, but I do believe that if concerns are brought to their attention, they must be taken seriously.  The responsibility lies with us, to be mindful of our online presence, to consider the consequences of our words.  As RAs, we are not expected to be omniscient, but we must be aware of the potential risks, and take steps to mitigate them.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, one that requires us to be vigilant, to be mindful of the words we choose to share, and the world we create.  We must not be swayed by the siren song of anonymity, but instead, we must take responsibility for our actions, for the words we release into the void.  Only then can we hope to navigate this vast and unforgiving expanse, unscathed.",
            "The war has dragged on interminably, its purpose muddled beyond recognition. What began as a noble crusade to plant the seeds of democracy in foreign soil has withered and died, its original intent lost in a morass of bureaucratic tedium and imperial hubris. The dream of liberating a people from tyranny was a just one, but it was sullied from the outset by the personal vendettas of those who sought to impose their will upon the world. The ghosts of George Bush's father linger, their ghosts whispering in the ears of those who would wield power.\n\nWe did manage to make our presence known in the early days, our statement a stark and brutal one. But the years have dragged on, a seemingly endless expanse of blood and gold. The war has become a thing in and of itself, a self-perpetuating beast that devours our economy and our souls. We speak of victory, of a decisive end to the conflict, but what does that mean in a landscape scorched and barren? What does it mean when the very purpose of the war has been lost to the sands of time?\n\nThe cost is staggering, a drain on our resources that could be better spent on the very problems that plague our own shores. Poverty, neglect, and decay – these are the enemies we should be fighting, not some far-off tyranny. We speak of democracy, of freedom, but we are blind to the tyranny of our own making. We are bleeding ourselves dry, our people dying in a foreign land for a cause that has long since been lost.\n\nThe time has come to extricate ourselves from this quagmire, to recognize that the people we sought to liberate must now fend for themselves. The war has been a drain on our economy, a stain on our conscience. It is time to end it, to redirect our efforts towards the problems that truly matter. We must tend to our own gardens, to nurture the seeds of freedom and justice that bloom within our own borders. For in the end, it is not the wars we fight abroad that will define us, but the wars we fight at home.",
            "The notion that someone's actions were foiled because of something they found online weighs heavy on my mind.  It seems it all began with a simple search, a perusal of the internet, where the boundaries of our private lives are laid bare.  For on sites like Myspace, where one's most intimate thoughts are shared with the world, it is a given that all who wander upon it will bear witness to our deepest secrets.  And indeed, it is a condition of entry, a tacit understanding that comes with accepting another as a \"friend\" - that they may see all that we hold dear.  It is a surrender, a yielding of our private selves to the void, where the gaze of strangers lingers and lingers.\n\nAnd yet, in the face of such vulnerability, we find solace in the notion that some benevolent soul may stumble upon our online presence and prevent a calamity from unfolding.  But how do we reconcile this with the specter of surveillance, the notion that one person, tasked with monitoring the online lives of all, may become judge, jury, and executioner?  The burden of such a responsibility weighs heavy indeed, a weight that threatens to crush the very spirit of freedom.\n\nI am a user of Facebook, and while I take some comfort in the fact that I have chosen who among my acquaintances may view my profile, I am still wary of the unseen eyes that lurk in the shadows.  A television program once aired a segment about a man who demonstrated the ease with which one may uncover the most intimate details of another's life.  He discovered a young woman's screen name and, in a matter of minutes, coaxed her into meeting with him.  The ease with which he accomplished this sent a shiver down my spine, a stark reminder of the fragility of our online existence.\n\nAs I navigate the delicate balance between openness and secrecy, I am reminded of the words of my roommate, who spoke of a time when her high school banned students from using Myspace.  The notion struck me as a heavy-handed attempt to exert control over the lives of young people, a curtailment of their freedom that seemed both oppressive and misguided.  Did the authorities truly have the right to dictate what these young people could and could not do?  I am but a humble student, unsure of the answers to such questions, but I do know that in this vast, interconnected web we weave, the lines between private and public are increasingly blurred.",
            "The weight of the Iraq War settles upon us like a shroud, a constant reminder of the hubris that guides our actions. To speak of it now, to offer an opinion, is to invite the charge of hypocrisy. And I confess, I am hesitant, wary of joining the chorus of critics who declare their opposition with such certitude. But I was against it, yes, I was. The war was a calamity from its inception, a maelstrom of violence and bloodshed that consumed us all.\n\nThe polls are legion, a chorus of voices that cry out against the folly of our endeavors. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, a staggering number, declares the war a mistake. The Iraqis themselves, those we sought to save, are resolute in their desire for our departure. Eighty percent of the population clamors for our exit, a quarter more, driven by desperation, demands we leave now. And what of the troops, the brave men and women who toil in the desert, their sweat and blood shed in a cause they no longer believe in? They too, a majority, yearn for the day when we will depart, when the madness will cease.\n\nThe culture clash, a chasm so deep it seems insurmountable, separates us from the people of the Middle East. We brought democracy to a land where it was uninvited, where the very notion is anathema. The administration, blind to the futility of our endeavor, persists in its delusions. Saddam, a monster, yes, but was he not a monster of our making, a creature born of our own creation? The pros and cons, weighed and measured, revealed a war that would be a disaster, a quicksand that would consume us all.\n\nI see no reason to stay, no justification for our continued presence. The administration's hopes, their optimistic assessments of a brighter future, ring hollow. The problems that may arise from our departure, they pale in comparison to the catastrophe we have wrought. We have asked the Iraqis, those we claim to aid, what they desire, and they have told us to leave. Their voices, a cacophony of desperation, should be heeded. If we depart, we will be free from the guilt of our actions, our hands clean of the blood we have spilled.\n\nAnd so, I say, let us leave. Let us depart, and let the people of Iraq forge their own destiny, free from our interference. It matters not if we are seen as the \"good guys\" or not. We will never be. But we can be the lesser of two evils, a presence that is no longer a burden.",
            "The specter of gender discrimination haunts the United States like a persistent shadow, a relic of a bygone era that refuses to be vanquished. It seeps into every crevice of our society, manifesting in the most insidious ways. For women, the glass ceiling remains an unyielding barrier, a constant reminder that, despite the rhetoric of equality, true parity remains a distant dream. The workplace is a crucible where this inequality is forged, where the very notion of a woman in a position of power is still met with skepticism and doubt.\n\nHistorically, women have been relegated to the periphery of the business world, their careers stunted by the weight of societal expectations. The boardrooms, once the exclusive domain of men, continue to be the preserve of a select few, their ranks still largely bereft of women. And yet, even when women do break through, they are often met with resistance, their abilities questioned by those who cannot fathom a world where a woman is the leader. It is a cruel irony that the very same society that touts equality as a fundamental right can be so quick to undermine it.\n\nBut this is not a problem unique to women. Men, too, are bound by the strictures of societal expectations. The stay-at-home father, once a rare and pitied creature, is now beginning to find acceptance, albeit grudgingly. The old adage that a man's place is in the breadwinner's role still holds sway, and those who defy this convention are met with suspicion and scorn. And in the rarefied world of fashion, the male who dares to dabble in creativity and style is often dismissed as an aberration, his sensibilities suspect because they do not conform to traditional norms.\n\nThe solution, it seems, lies in a delicate balance between promoting the qualities of those who are marginalized and not overwhelming them with forced change. It is a slow and painful process, one that requires patience and understanding. We have made progress, to be sure, but the road ahead is long and treacherous. The greatest challenge lies not in pushing forward, but in convincing a society that is wedded to its traditions to accept the new and the different.\n\nAnd yet, even as we make progress, we are reminded that discrimination knows no bounds. The rural dweller, with his rough-hewn manner and unpolished speech, is often looked down upon by those who have never known hardship. His intelligence and worth are discounted because of his place of origin, his very accent a badge of shame. It is a cruel reminder that, in the end, it is not just gender that is the source of our biases, but a complex tapestry of factors that we would do well to acknowledge and confront.",
            "The notion of legalization, or rather decriminalization, is a point of contention. They did not eradicate it, merely relegated it from a transgression worthy of the full weight of the law to a minor infraction, akin to a traffic citation. A slap on the wrist, a summons to appear, a fleeting inconvenience, rather than the crushing restraint of incarceration. \n\nThe long-term repercussions, however, linger, a specter haunting the lives of those who have been touched by it. The specter of disapproval, of revulsion, of a cloud that follows one's every step, a constant reminder of past transgressions. It is a burden that does not evaporate with the stroke of a pen, nor with the passage of time.\n\nYet, there are those who argue that the cost of pursuing such transgressions is prohibitive. The expense of arrest, of trial, of incarceration, of the endless cycles of the justice system, a drain on resources that could be better allocated elsewhere. In municipalities strained by financial hardship, the prospect of embracing decriminalization is a hard pill to swallow, a concession too great to make.\n\nBut in places where the winds of change are blowing, where the air is thick with the scent of progress, the calculus shifts. Denver, a city of open minds and open hearts, has taken the leap, and in doing so, has freed up resources to be allocated to more pressing concerns: the education of its youth, the care of its elderly, the sustenance of its most vulnerable citizens.\n\nIt is a delicate balance, a tightrope to walk, for marijuana is not a substance to be taken lightly. Its presence can be a blight, a scourge on the streets, a poison that seeps into the very fabric of society. Yet, in moderation, it can be a panacea, a balm for the weary soul.\n\nBut moderation is a virtue that not all possess, and the effects of its abuse can be far-reaching. The motor skills impaired, the decision-making clouded, the lifestyle altered in ways both subtle and profound. And yet, like all substances, it is a double-edged sword, a tool that can be wielded for good or ill, depending on the hand that wields it.\n\nIt is a mystery, this interaction between substance and user, a puzzle that may never be fully solved. Each person reacts differently, a unique harmony of biology and environment, a symphony of chemicals and circumstances. Some are able to navigate the treacherous waters with ease, while others are shipwrecked on the rocky shores of addiction.\n\nAnd so, we are left with a complex web of considerations, a tapestry woven from the threads of reason and restraint, of freedom and responsibility. The path forward is not always clear, but one thing is certain: the consequences of our choices will be with us for a long time to come.",
            "The devout and the dogmatic, entrenched in the traditions of a bygone era, cling to the familiar rhythms of the past.  Theirs is a path well-worn and well-trodden, a litany of rituals and observances that have been practiced for generations.  And yet, it is this very steadfastness that can also be a hindrance, a refusal to bend and yield to the tides of change.\n\nThe Church, a bastion of tradition, often finds itself at odds with the world outside its walls.  The strictures of doctrine, the weight of dogma, can sometimes lead to a narrow and unyielding view of the world, one that shuns those who do not conform to its teachings.  The Catholic Church, a bastion of orthodoxy, has long been criticized for its rigidity, its refusal to accept those who do not subscribe to its creed.\n\nI know this firsthand, having grown up in a household where faith and family were inextricably linked.  My parents, both Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, were denied the sacrament of marriage in the Catholic Church, a decision that spoke volumes about the Church's stance on those who do not toe the line.  It was a lesson in the hypocrisy of the Church's teachings, a stark reminder that the ideals of love and acceptance are often at odds with the realities of practice.\n\nThe Church's stance on issues such as the ordination of priests is a case in point.  Some argue that allowing priests to marry would be a step towards greater inclusivity and humanity, a way to make the Church more relatable and accessible to the world outside its walls.  But others see it as a slippery slope, a concession that would lead to further erosion of the Church's moral fiber.\n\nI am not naive to the darkness that lurks within the human heart, the capacity for cruelty and degradation that can lead individuals to commit heinous acts.  The abuse of children by clergy is a tragedy of unspeakable proportions, a stain on the fabric of the Church that cannot be ignored.  And yet, I do not believe that the institution of marriage would be a panacea for this problem.  The rot of corruption runs deep, a product of a culture that has long been willing to turn a blind eye to the deviant and the depraved.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that is the problem, but rather the human condition itself.  We are all flawed and frail, prone to making mistakes and committing atrocities.  The Church would do well to remember this, to recognize that its teachings are not a panacea for the human condition, but rather a reflection of it.",
            "The line blurs between the sanctity of matrimony and the cold calculus of the state.  It is a conundrum that has plagued us for some time, a Gordian knot of separation and definition.  How can one untangle the threads of sacred vow and secular law?  The very essence of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil institution to others, hangs precariously in the balance.\n\nThe notion of marriage, a union of two souls, is tampered with when the government seeks to define it.  A sacrament, like baptism, shrouded in mystery and reverence, is not to be sullied by the mundane considerations of tax breaks and bureaucratic trappings.  And yet, it is this very thing that the government would have us believe is the essence of marriage: a union of two people, bound together by the threads of love and commitment.\n\nBut what of those whose unions are not recognized by the state?  Do they not deserve the same rights, the same protections, as any other couple?  The fact that they love one another, that they have pledged their troth, is not diminished by the fact of their love being different.  It is a union, a union of two people, and as such, it deserves our recognition and respect.\n\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a futile exercise in futility.  It is a gesture born of fear and intolerance, a desperate attempt to codify a prejudice that has no place in a just society.  The constitution is not a tool to be wielded by the whims of the powerful, but a document that enshrines our fundamental freedoms.  To amend it for such a trivial matter is to undermine its very purpose.\n\nNo, the question of gay marriage is not a matter for constitutional amendment.  It is a matter of simple justice, of recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of all human beings.  It is a matter of compassion, of empathy, of love.  And it is a matter that demands our attention, our consideration, and our action.",
            "The shadows of upbringing linger, a Christian heritage casting a faint glow upon the nuances of my convictions. The grayness of homosexuality, a specter that haunts my thoughts, a paradox of values that refuse to be reconciled. Friends, dear companions, who have walked alongside me through the trials of life, their struggles and triumphs a testament to the indomitable human spirit – and yet, I find myself wrestling with the notion of their chosen path.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of our nation, the threads of dissent are woven, and I believe that the threads of freedom should not be bound by the dictates of a single will. The states, those bastions of democratic virtue, should be free to chart their own course, their voices echoing through the chambers of history, unencumbered by the weight of a centralized authority. For it is in the local, the particular, that we find the true essence of our humanity – the struggles, the triumphs, and the quiet moments of introspection.\n\nIn this crucible of diversity, where the Democratic and Republican fires burn bright, the fate of gay marriage hangs in the balance. And I believe that it is the duty of each state to forge its own path, to walk its own road, unshackled by the chains of federal dictate. For who am I to dictate the course of another's life, when the very essence of our democracy lies in the freedom to choose? The President, that symbol of unity and strength, should not be the arbiter of our deepest convictions, nor should his will be imposed upon the states like a shackle upon the soul.\n\nThe tempests of history will rage on, and the ebb and flow of power will see to it that the ban on gay marriage will ebb and flow with the tides of time. And so, I believe that it is the right of each state to chart its own course, to forge its own destiny, unencumbered by the weight of a centralized authority. For it is in the local, the particular, that we find the true essence of our humanity – the struggles, the triumphs, and the quiet moments of introspection.",
            "The notion of Myspace as a public space is a notion that I find myself grappling with. It is a platform where one's thoughts and actions are laid bare for all to see, a bulletin board of sorts where the public can peruse and scrutinize. And it is here that I find myself torn between the desire for freedom of expression and the need for oversight.\n\nThe school officials, in their pursuit of a safer environment, had every right to monitor the online activities of students. For even if they were not explicitly searching for signs of future threats under the school's name, they could easily access the information from the comfort of their own homes. And in the face of the horrific tragedies that have befallen our schools, such as Columbine, I believe it is the responsibility of the school system to take all necessary precautions.\n\nBut, I must confess, there is a fine line between monitoring and intrusion. When officials use the internet as a tool to police students, it can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Yet, if their actions are motivated by a desire to prevent harm and protect the students, I believe it is a necessary evil.\n\nAs I reflect on this issue, I am reminded of my own experiences in school, where the threat of violence was ever-present. We held drills and practiced lock downs, a grim reminder of the world beyond our walls. And it is this world that the school officials were trying to safeguard against.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance between freedom and security. While I would not condone a blanket imposition of surveillance, I do believe that officials have a responsibility to protect their students. And if that means monitoring online activity, so be it.\n\nBut the notion that students are naive to the consequences of their actions online is a notion that I reject. We live in a world where a careless word can come back to haunt us, a world where our online actions are forever etched in the digital ledger. And it is this awareness that I believe should temper our desires for freedom of expression.\n\nIn the end, I believe that the school officials' actions, though invasive, were motivated by a desire to protect their students. And while I would not support a blanket policy of surveillance, I do believe that there are times when it is necessary.",
            "In the aftermath of the calamity that befell on that fateful day, the world was forever altered. I, like many, was consumed by the flames of vengeance and a deep-seated desire for retribution. The urge to retaliate, to create a chaos akin to the one that had been wrought upon our own shores, was a palpable force that drove us forward. Yet, as time wore on, the fervor began to dissipate, and with it, the clarity of purpose that had once guided us.\n\nIn the haze of our zeal, we overlooked the long game, the intricate tapestry of consequences that would unfold in the deserts of a distant land. We marched forth, unprepared and unbridled, our hearts heavy with the weight of anger and our minds clouded by the fumes of emotion. And in that haste, we sowed the seeds of discord, reaping a harvest of bitter fruit that would haunt us for years to come.\n\nThe people we sought to liberate, to bring order to, seemed more akin to a maelstrom of savagery, their code of conduct a labyrinth of contradictions that defied our comprehension. They fought amongst themselves, a internecine struggle that left us bewildered and bereft of a clear objective. And in our attempts to impose our will upon them, we only served to fan the flames of their discord, our presence a constant irritant that fueled their intractable divisions.\n\nOur leaders, driven by the passions of the moment, declared war on a nation, a decision born of emotion rather than reason. And we, the people, were swept along in their wake, our voices a cacophony of approval and disapproval, our actions a chaotic tapestry of uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy that proved to be our undoing, but our own hubris, our failure to grasp the complexity of the situation, our refusal to temper our zeal with wisdom. We sought to remake a nation, to impose our will upon a people who had long been accustomed to their own particular brand of chaos. And in that endeavor, we were doomed to fail, our presence a constant reminder of our limitations, our inability to grasp the intricacies of a world that was so far removed from our own.\n\nToday, as I stand on the precipice of this new era, I am forced to confront the harsh realities of our actions. We may have made progress, but it is a progress that is fragile, ephemeral, and ultimately, unsustainable. The longer we stay, the more we risk becoming entangled in the very fabric of the chaos we seek to escape. And so, I am left with the uncomfortable truth: that perhaps it is time for us to relinquish our grip on a land that has proven to be as elusive as it is unforgiving."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the depths of a changing world, the Catholic Church stands as a relic of a bygone era.  A once mighty institution, now hemorrhaging followers as it clings to antiquated tenets.  The fault lies not in the faithful, but in the Church's rigid stance on issues of the modern age.  The specter of gay marriage, the contentious issue of abortion, and the contentious matter of birth control loom large, casting a pall of intolerance over a Church that once claimed to be the embodiment of compassion.\n\nTheir views, though well-intentioned, are naively out of touch with the world around them.  As the Church remains steadfast in its opposition to these modern conundrums, it risks losing the very people it seeks to guide.  The Church's unyielding stance on these matters appears to be a relics of a bygone era, a time when the world was a simpler, more black-and-white place.  In this brave new world, the Church must adapt or risk irrelevance.\n\nThe erosion of faith is a gradual process, one that begins with a growing sense of disillusionment.  As individuals come to realize that their own values are at odds with those of the Church, they drift away, drawn to a more inclusive, more compassionate worldview.  The Church's rigid stance on these issues serves only to drive them further away, a cold wind that howls through the empty pews.\n\nConsider the matter of abortion.  A woman's right to choose is a fundamental tenet of modern society, one that the Church vehemently opposes.  For those who hold this view dear, the idea of belonging to a community that denounces it as a sin is a bitter pill to swallow.  Similarly, the Church's stance on gay marriage serves as a barrier to entry for those who would otherwise find solace in its teachings.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of female priests and married clergy.  A seeming anachronism in an age where women hold positions of power and authority, the Church's refusal to ordain women or permit its clergy to marry is a relic of a bygone era.  Does it follow that this would have altered the course of history?  Perhaps not.  Yet it is a question worth pondering, a reminder that even the most seemingly immutable institutions are subject to the whims of time.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of balance.  The priest, like any man, is a multifaceted individual, capable of love, compassion, and devotion.  Why must he be bound to a single, monastic existence?  The world outside the Church is full of men and women who have found a way to balance their work and their personal lives.  Why should the priest be any different?  It is a question that speaks to the very heart of the Church's dilemma: can it adapt, or will it succumb to the forces of progress?  Only time will tell.",
            "The shadows of doubt crept in, like a chill on a winter's night, as I grappled with the weight of a question that had been thrust upon me. The notion of gay marriage, a concept that had been debated by many, left me with a sense of unease, like a land torn asunder by the ravages of time. I did not find myself opposed to the union of two individuals, regardless of their persuasion, for in the end, it is not the choices we make that define us, but the essence that lies within.\n\nThe idea that one is born with a predisposition, a leaning towards the unknown, seemed to me a truth both simple and profound. Whether it is the whispered secrets of the womb or the whispered prayers of the heavens, the mystery of our existence remains a tangled web of fate and chance. To hold another accountable for that which they cannot control, to judge them for that which they cannot change, seemed to me a cruel and heartless act.\n\nI thought of the words of a wise man, who once said that to deny another their right to love, to love as they see fit, is to deny the very essence of humanity. And I could not help but agree, for in the grand tapestry of life, it is not the politics of man that define us, but the love we share with one another. The federal government, with its laws and regulations, its moral codes and decrees, seemed to me an outsider, a stranger in a strange land, meddling in matters that were not its to meddle in.\n\nThe thought of it was a heavy burden to bear, a weight that pressed upon my chest like the stones of a grave. But I knew that I could not remain silent, for in the silence lies the consent of the oppressor. So I spoke out, a lone voice in the wilderness, a cry of protest against the injustice that had been done.\n\nIn the end, it was not a matter of choice, but of right and wrong. It was not a matter of politics, but of the human heart. And I knew that I could not stand idly by, for to do so would be to betray the very essence of our shared humanity.",
            "In the twilight of modernity, where shadows of doubt creep across the landscape, a question lingers: should the union of two individuals of the same sex be recognized by the law? The answer, like the wind that rustles through the trees, seems simple, yet it holds the weight of centuries. For what reason, indeed, can be cited to deny the love and commitment of two individuals who seek the sacred bond of marriage?\n\nMany claim that the union of same-sex couples threatens the institution of the family, that it is an aberration, a deviation from the natural order. But this reasoning falters on the rocks of reason. For what is the family, but a union of love and commitment, a bond that transcends the boundaries of flesh and blood? The love and devotion of two individuals, regardless of their sex, is a flame that burns with the same fierce and unwavering passion.\n\nAnd what of the rights that accompany marriage? The right to share property, to make medical decisions, to visit one another in times of sickness? These are not the exclusive domain of heterosexuality, but the universal rights of humanity. To deny these rights to same-sex couples is to render them less than human, to treat them as second-class citizens.\n\nThe studies are clear: same-sex couples fare no differently in their relationships than their straight counterparts. They experience the same joys and sorrows, the same triumphs and failures. They love and cherish one another with the same ferocity, the same devotion. And yet, they are denied the simple recognition of their love, the dignity of marriage.\n\nThe Church and State have long been entwined, but this union is not a sacrament. Marriage is a civil contract, a document issued by the government, not a sacred ritual. To deny same-sex couples this document is to deny them their basic human rights. It is a form of segregation, a separate but unequal system that perpetuates the notion that some are more equal than others.\n\nThe arguments against gay marriage are built on shifting sands. Some claim that children of same-sex parents will be damaged by their upbringing, that they will be influenced by their parents' orientation. But the evidence is to the contrary. Children of gay parents are just as well-adjusted, just as happy, as children of straight parents. They are shaped by their environment, their culture, their family, not by the sex of their parents.\n\nThe federal government should take a stand on this issue, should recognize the love and commitment of same-sex couples and grant them the same rights and dignity as their straight counterparts. The amendment that seeks to ban gay marriage is a relic of a bygone era, a relic of intolerance and bigotry.\n\nAnd so, I say to those who would deny same-sex couples the right to marry: listen to the evidence, listen to the experts, listen to the hearts of those who would be denied their basic human rights. For in the end, it is not about morality or religion, but about justice, about equality, about the simple recognition of the love and commitment of two individuals who seek to build a life together.",
            "The sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy where I toil away during the sweltering summer months. It is a place where the boundaries of legality are often blurred, where the distinctions between right and wrong are tested by the cold, unforgiving light of necessity. A drug, no matter its illicit status, holds within it the power to either heal or harm. The fact that some substances are outlawed does not preclude their utility; indeed, many a controlled substance finds its way into the pharmacy, its potency harnessed for the greater good.\n\nConsider oxycodone, vicodin, and perocet - these are the pharmaceuticals that walk the fine line between solace and addiction. We employ them with caution, mindful of the thin thread that separates benefit from ruin. And yet, we dare not apply the same reasoning to cannabis, that most maligned of substances. The taboo that surrounds it is a heavy shroud, one that obscures the truth of its potential benefits.\n\nAlcohol, too, is a substance that can be abused, its deleterious effects well-documented. But is it not also a substance that, in moderation, can bring solace and comfort to those who partake of it? I would argue that the same can be said of cannabis. The key lies not in its legalization, but in the removal of the damaging stigma that clings to it like a specter. When the public's perception of marijuana is no longer clouded by fear and misinformation, perhaps then we may see a shift towards responsible use.\n\nThe image of cannabis as a scourge on society is a false one, a product of our collective imagination. It is not heroine, nor cocaine, nor any of the other demons that haunt our collective psyche. It is time to peel away the layers of misconception and reveal the truth: that marijuana, like any substance, holds within it the potential for both harm and healing. Only when we acknowledge this duality can we hope to harness its benefits, and use it as a tool for the betterment of humanity.",
            "The church, a stalwart sentinel of tradition, has ceded to the whims of the modern era. Its once-stern visage has given way to a more relaxed countenance, a concession to the capricious nature of the 21st century. Sundays, once a day of solemn ritual, now unfold with a sense of informality, a far cry from the staid attire of yesteryear. The young girls, once decked in pristine dresses and matching shoes, now attend in casual splendor, their parents' relaxed attire a reflection of the times.\n\nI remember the private school's weekly gatherings, where friends would converge in a whirlwind of chatter and communal worship. The services, once a staid and lengthy affair, have been condensed to a mere thirty minutes, a pacing that belies the depth of the ritual. The summer months bring a special kind of chaos, as families, fresh from the beach, stumble into the sanctuary, their attire a testament to the irreverent spirit of the age.\n\nYet, despite these changes, the essence of the church remains, a constant in a world of flux. I dare not speculate on the intricacies of the church's politics, content to observe the external manifestations of its evolution. And so, I am left to ponder the larger questions that plague the institution: the allegations of pedophilia, the weight of which threatens to upend the very foundations of the church.\n\nIn my considered opinion, I do not believe that the church's stance on marriage or the ordination of women would have averted the scourge of pedophilia. The inclinations of the afflicted are not so easily swayed by the sacraments of marriage or the presence of women in the clergy. These aberrant desires are, in my estimation, rooted in the very fabric of the individual, a product of their genetic predisposition. The façade of marriage or the absence of women in the clergy may yet conceal the true nature of the offender, a truth that will eventually be revealed in time.\n\nIf the church knew of these transgressions and chose to cover them up, then shame indeed befalls them. Yet, I do not believe that this is the case in all instances. The church, like any institution, is composed of fallible mortals, prone to the frailties of humanity. It is in the darkness of these failings that we must search for the truth, and not in the fleeting solutions offered by the changing of rules or the adoption of new practices.",
            "The September 11th attacks had left the nation reeling, a maelstrom of fear and uncertainty that hung in the air like a miasma. And in the midst of this chaos, the Bush administration's precipitous descent into Iraq seemed a pretext, a fragile thread of justification that threatened to unravel with each passing day. The assertion that Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction, that his regime was inextricably linked to the events of 9/11, now appears as a hollow sham, a fabrication that has left a stain upon the nation's conscience.\n\nThe memory of Colin Powell's presentation to the UN, a spectacle of conviction and conviction, now seems a distant echo, a hollow mockery of the truth. That even he, a man of integrity and principle, would later confess to doubts about the evidence, is a testament to the depths of malfeasance that had taken hold of the administration. To lie to the American people, to deceive them in such a brazen manner, is an offense of the gravest sort, an affront to the very fabric of our democracy.\n\nThe constitution, that sacred document that has guided us since our nation's inception, has been disregarded, its principles cast aside like so much trash. The Bush administration's actions, a calculated move towards war, a war that was seemingly ordained from the outset, has left a trail of destruction in its wake. The younger Bush, driven by a vendetta, a desire for vengeance, against the Hussein regime, has overseen a catastrophe of epic proportions.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has reached a critical juncture, a precipice from which there seems no return. The withdrawal of American forces would likely plunge the country into chaos, a maelstrom of violence that would claim countless lives. Yet, the alternative, a coalition of regional nations, seems equally unpalatable, a recipe for disaster. The interim government teeters on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty compromised by the very presence of foreign powers.\n\nThe news from Iraq is a litany of woes, a tale of a government in disarray, of politicians at odds, and of radical elements vying for power. The Parliament, a body tasked with guiding the nation towards stability, is a shadow of its former self, a mere shell of a institution. And as the country teeters on the edge of chaos, there seems no respite, no clear path forward, only the specter of continued strife and bloodshed.",
            "The shadows of doubt crept over me like a shroud, as I struggled to articulate my thoughts on the war in Iraq. A conflict that had long since lost its clarity, its purpose, and its meaning. It was a war that had never been declared, a war that had been reduced to a mere whisper, a war that had devoured the very fabric of our nation's conscience. \n\nLike a mirage on the desert sands, the war's justification seemed to shift and writhe, evading my grasp. Was it a quest for democracy, a crusade to bring freedom to the oppressed? Or was it a naked display of power, a flexing of muscles to assert our dominance over the Middle East? I couldn't say, for certain. The lines had grown blurred, the truth obscured by the din of propaganda and the stench of blood and smoke.\n\nAs I spoke, my words faltered, like a man stumbling through a barren landscape. I felt the weight of my ignorance bearing down upon me, the knowledge that I knew so little of the conflict, of its causes, its consequences, its very essence. And yet, I felt the weight of my opinions, the conviction that this war was a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task that would consume us all.\n\nBut then, a glimmer of doubt crept in, like a cold wind on a winter's night. What of the families, the sons and daughters who fought and died in this senseless conflict? What of the lives we had destroyed, the hope we had extinguished? I thought of the children, forced to grow up in a world of violence and fear, their futures reduced to a mere specter. And I felt the weight of my words, the weight of my indecision.\n\nThe war in Iraq had become a Gordian knot, a tangled web of conflicting desires and flawed justifications. I couldn't untangle it, couldn't make sense of it. All I could do was stand there, frozen in uncertainty, as the war raged on, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and despair.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, I felt the pressure to speak, to say something, anything, to fill the void. But my words were hollow, empty, and futile. The war in Iraq had become a void, a chasm that swallowed all meaning, all purpose. And I was left with nothing but the echoes of my own indecision.",
            "The notion of the state's involvement in the affairs of the church is a notion that reeks of trespass. It is a thing that reeks of overreach, of a power that knows no bounds. The constitution, that venerable document, speaks of a separation of church and state, a delicate balance that must be maintained lest we invite the darkness of dogma into the halls of government. And yet, it seems that there are those who would seek to upset this balance, to impose their will upon us all.\n\nThe argument, such as it is, centers around the idea that the churches themselves should be the ones to dictate what is right and wrong. But this is a flawed notion, for it is the state that must ensure that the rights of all are protected, not just those of the dominant few. And what of those who do not subscribe to the dominant creed? Are they to be cast aside, their rights ignored in favor of the whims of the powerful?\n\nThe push for an amendment, a move that would effectively codify the state's role in the church, is a move that reeks of hypocrisy. It is a move that seeks to impose the will of one group upon the many, to dictate what is acceptable and what is not. And for what reason? So that the president, or some other self-appointed arbiter, may impose their personal views upon the nation? It is a thing that I do not understand.\n\nThe impact of such a move would be far-reaching, and not in a good way. It would be a blow to the very fabric of our society, a society built on the principles of tolerance and understanding. It would be a move that would further divide us, that would create a chasm between those who are deemed acceptable and those who are not. And for what? So that a few may impose their will upon the many?\n\nI do not believe that the federal government, or any government for that matter, should be involved in this issue. It is not their place to dictate what is right and wrong, to impose their will upon the churches. The churches, with their ancient traditions and their sacred texts, must be left to their own devices. It is they who must decide what is acceptable, not some self-appointed authority.\n\nAnd as for the amendment itself, I see no reason for it. It is a move that would be a restriction, not of the government, but of the people. It would be a move that would stifle the very freedom that we hold dear, that would limit the choices of those who do not share the views of the dominant few. It is a move that I do not support, and one that I fear would have far-reaching and devastating consequences.",
            "The shadows of war cast a long and foreboding presence over the desolate landscape of Iraq. A war born of deceit and fueled by the flames of a nation's outrage, its justification a tangled web of half-truths and calculated manipulation. The government's words, like autumn leaves, rustled in the wind, promising a swift and triumphant victory, but in reality, they hid the darkness that was to come.\n\nI recall the echoes of a nation's anger, still resonating from the wounds of September 11th, a day that shattered the complacency of a people and set in motion the machinery of war. The drums of war beat loud and clear, as the government wove a tale of connection, a narrative that tied the invasion of Iraq to the heinous acts of terrorism. But the threads of truth were thin and frayed, and the fabric of reality was soon to be torn asunder.\n\nAs one opposed to the senseless slaughter of war, I watched with dread as the US government plunged headlong into the abyss, heedless of the lessons of the past, particularly the Vietnam War, where hubris and arrogance had led to a quagmire of blood and tears. The US government, in its haste to impose its will, failed to consider the complexities of human nature, the fierce resistance that would rise against the occupation, and the void left in the wake of a toppled regime.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's government was a pyre that burned brightly, but its embers cast a long shadow, illuminating the chaos and anarchy that followed. The US government, woefully unprepared for the aftermath, stumbled forward, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction and death. The nation's soldiers, like so many sacrificial lambs, fell to the ground, their blood a testament to the senselessness of war.\n\nThe attempt to impose democracy on a nation, akin to the Vietnam experience, was a folly of monumental proportions. The US government had forgotten the struggles of its own past, the blood-soaked battles fought to establish its own democracy. The path to freedom is never an easy one, but the US government seemed to believe that its own brand of democracy was the panacea for all ills.\n\nAs the war dragged on, and American casualties mounted, the question of why Iraq had become the chosen battleground lingered, an elephant in the room, a truth that was too painful to confront. The oil, the resources, the strategic interests – these were the unspoken reasons that drove the US government's actions. North Korea, a nation known to possess WMDs, was left untouched, a stark reminder of the duplicity that lay at the heart of US foreign policy.\n\nThe war in Iraq has become a quagmire of uncertainty, a testament to the futility of war. The ghosts of the past haunt the present, a reminder that the US government's actions were not driven by altruism, but by a desire for power and control. As the war drags on, the question of when it will end, and at what cost, remains a haunting specter, a reminder that the wounds of war will take generations to heal.",
            "The question hangs in the air like a specter, its presence as inevitable as the sun's descent into the desert horizon. I have always stood resolute, unyielding in my conviction: the union of two individuals, regardless of their station or inclination, should be a matter of personal choice, unencumbered by the heavy hand of societal dictate.\n\nIt is a notion that has been borne out by the whispers of science: the delicate tapestry of our biology, a complex dance of hormones and genes that we cannot fully comprehend, yet which may well determine the course of our destinies. And it is here that I believe the crux of the matter lies - in the inescapable fact that our inclinations, those secret and furtive stirrings that shape us, are not our own to command or reject.\n\nThe notion that we should be denied the simple freedom to love, to form a union that brings us joy and comfort, because of some arbitrary construct of societal expectation, is a cruelty of the highest order. It is a cruel joke, played by those who would seek to impose their will upon us, to dictate the terms of our existence.\n\nI have walked among those who have been denied this basic right, those couples who, despite their devotion to one another, are forced to keep their love hidden, their relationships shrouded in secrecy. I have seen the way they live, their lives a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience and adaptation. They do not differ from us, save in the eyes of those who would seek to judge them. They walk their dogs, they live their lives, they love with the same fervor and devotion as any other family.\n\nAnd yet, those who would seek to impose their will upon us, to interpret the sacred institution of marriage through the prism of their own twisted desires, are the ones who are truly ridiculous. They would have us believe that their interpretation is the one true vision, that their God-given right to dictate the terms of our existence is a divine mandate.\n\nBut I know the truth. I know that marriage is a simple, private thing, a union between two people who love one another, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation. It is a thing that should be celebrated, not condemned. It is a thing that should be left to the individuals, to the households, to the communities that they call home. Not to the politicians, not to the governments, not to the self-appointed guardians of morality.\n\nI have read, I have heard, I have seen the evidence. The science is clear: our inclinations are not a choice, but a fact, a biological imperative that cannot be denied. And it is here that I stand, resolute in my conviction that the freedom to love, to form a union, should be a basic human right, unencumbered by the vicissitudes of societal opinion.",
            "The void of the internet spreads far, a vast and unforgiving expanse where words take on lives of their own.  When we cast our thoughts into this chasm, we must not be surprised if they are received in ways we could never have intended.  As an RA, I've seen it myself - the reckless abandon of words, the gravity of their consequences.  A careless quip, a thoughtless post, and the world is altered, its currents shifting to carry us along.  We cannot hide behind the veil of anonymity, for the internet is a public forum, a place where the boundaries of our private lives are constantly blurred.\n\nI recall a particular incident at our school, one that served as a stark reminder of the perils of this virtual world.  A student's words, meant as a joke, were overheard and reported to the authorities.  In the aftermath, it became clear that the student's online presence had been the catalyst for the entire ordeal.  The dangers of this space are real, and we must be mindful of the impact our words can have.  Once we release something into the ether, we cannot reclaim it, cannot control how it is received.\n\nThe notion of privacy is a fleeting concept in this digital age.  If we do not wish to be seen, we must be cautious about what we reveal.  But even then, the lines are blurred, and the boundaries are constantly shifting.  School officials, in their efforts to protect their students, must navigate this treacherous landscape.  They are not voyeurs, but custodians, tasked with ensuring the safety of those in their care.\n\nI do not advocate for the monitoring of private conversations, but I do believe that if concerns are brought to their attention, they must be taken seriously.  The responsibility lies with us, to be mindful of our online presence, to consider the consequences of our words.  As RAs, we are not expected to be omniscient, but we must be aware of the potential risks, and take steps to mitigate them.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, one that requires us to be vigilant, to be mindful of the words we choose to share, and the world we create.  We must not be swayed by the siren song of anonymity, but instead, we must take responsibility for our actions, for the words we release into the void.  Only then can we hope to navigate this vast and unforgiving expanse, unscathed.",
            "The war has dragged on interminably, its purpose muddled beyond recognition. What began as a noble crusade to plant the seeds of democracy in foreign soil has withered and died, its original intent lost in a morass of bureaucratic tedium and imperial hubris. The dream of liberating a people from tyranny was a just one, but it was sullied from the outset by the personal vendettas of those who sought to impose their will upon the world. The ghosts of George Bush's father linger, their ghosts whispering in the ears of those who would wield power.\n\nWe did manage to make our presence known in the early days, our statement a stark and brutal one. But the years have dragged on, a seemingly endless expanse of blood and gold. The war has become a thing in and of itself, a self-perpetuating beast that devours our economy and our souls. We speak of victory, of a decisive end to the conflict, but what does that mean in a landscape scorched and barren? What does it mean when the very purpose of the war has been lost to the sands of time?\n\nThe cost is staggering, a drain on our resources that could be better spent on the very problems that plague our own shores. Poverty, neglect, and decay – these are the enemies we should be fighting, not some far-off tyranny. We speak of democracy, of freedom, but we are blind to the tyranny of our own making. We are bleeding ourselves dry, our people dying in a foreign land for a cause that has long since been lost.\n\nThe time has come to extricate ourselves from this quagmire, to recognize that the people we sought to liberate must now fend for themselves. The war has been a drain on our economy, a stain on our conscience. It is time to end it, to redirect our efforts towards the problems that truly matter. We must tend to our own gardens, to nurture the seeds of freedom and justice that bloom within our own borders. For in the end, it is not the wars we fight abroad that will define us, but the wars we fight at home.",
            "The notion that someone's actions were foiled because of something they found online weighs heavy on my mind.  It seems it all began with a simple search, a perusal of the internet, where the boundaries of our private lives are laid bare.  For on sites like Myspace, where one's most intimate thoughts are shared with the world, it is a given that all who wander upon it will bear witness to our deepest secrets.  And indeed, it is a condition of entry, a tacit understanding that comes with accepting another as a \"friend\" - that they may see all that we hold dear.  It is a surrender, a yielding of our private selves to the void, where the gaze of strangers lingers and lingers.\n\nAnd yet, in the face of such vulnerability, we find solace in the notion that some benevolent soul may stumble upon our online presence and prevent a calamity from unfolding.  But how do we reconcile this with the specter of surveillance, the notion that one person, tasked with monitoring the online lives of all, may become judge, jury, and executioner?  The burden of such a responsibility weighs heavy indeed, a weight that threatens to crush the very spirit of freedom.\n\nI am a user of Facebook, and while I take some comfort in the fact that I have chosen who among my acquaintances may view my profile, I am still wary of the unseen eyes that lurk in the shadows.  A television program once aired a segment about a man who demonstrated the ease with which one may uncover the most intimate details of another's life.  He discovered a young woman's screen name and, in a matter of minutes, coaxed her into meeting with him.  The ease with which he accomplished this sent a shiver down my spine, a stark reminder of the fragility of our online existence.\n\nAs I navigate the delicate balance between openness and secrecy, I am reminded of the words of my roommate, who spoke of a time when her high school banned students from using Myspace.  The notion struck me as a heavy-handed attempt to exert control over the lives of young people, a curtailment of their freedom that seemed both oppressive and misguided.  Did the authorities truly have the right to dictate what these young people could and could not do?  I am but a humble student, unsure of the answers to such questions, but I do know that in this vast, interconnected web we weave, the lines between private and public are increasingly blurred.",
            "The weight of the Iraq War settles upon us like a shroud, a constant reminder of the hubris that guides our actions. To speak of it now, to offer an opinion, is to invite the charge of hypocrisy. And I confess, I am hesitant, wary of joining the chorus of critics who declare their opposition with such certitude. But I was against it, yes, I was. The war was a calamity from its inception, a maelstrom of violence and bloodshed that consumed us all.\n\nThe polls are legion, a chorus of voices that cry out against the folly of our endeavors. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, a staggering number, declares the war a mistake. The Iraqis themselves, those we sought to save, are resolute in their desire for our departure. Eighty percent of the population clamors for our exit, a quarter more, driven by desperation, demands we leave now. And what of the troops, the brave men and women who toil in the desert, their sweat and blood shed in a cause they no longer believe in? They too, a majority, yearn for the day when we will depart, when the madness will cease.\n\nThe culture clash, a chasm so deep it seems insurmountable, separates us from the people of the Middle East. We brought democracy to a land where it was uninvited, where the very notion is anathema. The administration, blind to the futility of our endeavor, persists in its delusions. Saddam, a monster, yes, but was he not a monster of our making, a creature born of our own creation? The pros and cons, weighed and measured, revealed a war that would be a disaster, a quicksand that would consume us all.\n\nI see no reason to stay, no justification for our continued presence. The administration's hopes, their optimistic assessments of a brighter future, ring hollow. The problems that may arise from our departure, they pale in comparison to the catastrophe we have wrought. We have asked the Iraqis, those we claim to aid, what they desire, and they have told us to leave. Their voices, a cacophony of desperation, should be heeded. If we depart, we will be free from the guilt of our actions, our hands clean of the blood we have spilled.\n\nAnd so, I say, let us leave. Let us depart, and let the people of Iraq forge their own destiny, free from our interference. It matters not if we are seen as the \"good guys\" or not. We will never be. But we can be the lesser of two evils, a presence that is no longer a burden.",
            "The specter of gender discrimination haunts the United States like a persistent shadow, a relic of a bygone era that refuses to be vanquished. It seeps into every crevice of our society, manifesting in the most insidious ways. For women, the glass ceiling remains an unyielding barrier, a constant reminder that, despite the rhetoric of equality, true parity remains a distant dream. The workplace is a crucible where this inequality is forged, where the very notion of a woman in a position of power is still met with skepticism and doubt.\n\nHistorically, women have been relegated to the periphery of the business world, their careers stunted by the weight of societal expectations. The boardrooms, once the exclusive domain of men, continue to be the preserve of a select few, their ranks still largely bereft of women. And yet, even when women do break through, they are often met with resistance, their abilities questioned by those who cannot fathom a world where a woman is the leader. It is a cruel irony that the very same society that touts equality as a fundamental right can be so quick to undermine it.\n\nBut this is not a problem unique to women. Men, too, are bound by the strictures of societal expectations. The stay-at-home father, once a rare and pitied creature, is now beginning to find acceptance, albeit grudgingly. The old adage that a man's place is in the breadwinner's role still holds sway, and those who defy this convention are met with suspicion and scorn. And in the rarefied world of fashion, the male who dares to dabble in creativity and style is often dismissed as an aberration, his sensibilities suspect because they do not conform to traditional norms.\n\nThe solution, it seems, lies in a delicate balance between promoting the qualities of those who are marginalized and not overwhelming them with forced change. It is a slow and painful process, one that requires patience and understanding. We have made progress, to be sure, but the road ahead is long and treacherous. The greatest challenge lies not in pushing forward, but in convincing a society that is wedded to its traditions to accept the new and the different.\n\nAnd yet, even as we make progress, we are reminded that discrimination knows no bounds. The rural dweller, with his rough-hewn manner and unpolished speech, is often looked down upon by those who have never known hardship. His intelligence and worth are discounted because of his place of origin, his very accent a badge of shame. It is a cruel reminder that, in the end, it is not just gender that is the source of our biases, but a complex tapestry of factors that we would do well to acknowledge and confront.",
            "The notion of legalization, or rather decriminalization, is a point of contention. They did not eradicate it, merely relegated it from a transgression worthy of the full weight of the law to a minor infraction, akin to a traffic citation. A slap on the wrist, a summons to appear, a fleeting inconvenience, rather than the crushing restraint of incarceration. \n\nThe long-term repercussions, however, linger, a specter haunting the lives of those who have been touched by it. The specter of disapproval, of revulsion, of a cloud that follows one's every step, a constant reminder of past transgressions. It is a burden that does not evaporate with the stroke of a pen, nor with the passage of time.\n\nYet, there are those who argue that the cost of pursuing such transgressions is prohibitive. The expense of arrest, of trial, of incarceration, of the endless cycles of the justice system, a drain on resources that could be better allocated elsewhere. In municipalities strained by financial hardship, the prospect of embracing decriminalization is a hard pill to swallow, a concession too great to make.\n\nBut in places where the winds of change are blowing, where the air is thick with the scent of progress, the calculus shifts. Denver, a city of open minds and open hearts, has taken the leap, and in doing so, has freed up resources to be allocated to more pressing concerns: the education of its youth, the care of its elderly, the sustenance of its most vulnerable citizens.\n\nIt is a delicate balance, a tightrope to walk, for marijuana is not a substance to be taken lightly. Its presence can be a blight, a scourge on the streets, a poison that seeps into the very fabric of society. Yet, in moderation, it can be a panacea, a balm for the weary soul.\n\nBut moderation is a virtue that not all possess, and the effects of its abuse can be far-reaching. The motor skills impaired, the decision-making clouded, the lifestyle altered in ways both subtle and profound. And yet, like all substances, it is a double-edged sword, a tool that can be wielded for good or ill, depending on the hand that wields it.\n\nIt is a mystery, this interaction between substance and user, a puzzle that may never be fully solved. Each person reacts differently, a unique harmony of biology and environment, a symphony of chemicals and circumstances. Some are able to navigate the treacherous waters with ease, while others are shipwrecked on the rocky shores of addiction.\n\nAnd so, we are left with a complex web of considerations, a tapestry woven from the threads of reason and restraint, of freedom and responsibility. The path forward is not always clear, but one thing is certain: the consequences of our choices will be with us for a long time to come.",
            "The devout and the dogmatic, entrenched in the traditions of a bygone era, cling to the familiar rhythms of the past.  Theirs is a path well-worn and well-trodden, a litany of rituals and observances that have been practiced for generations.  And yet, it is this very steadfastness that can also be a hindrance, a refusal to bend and yield to the tides of change.\n\nThe Church, a bastion of tradition, often finds itself at odds with the world outside its walls.  The strictures of doctrine, the weight of dogma, can sometimes lead to a narrow and unyielding view of the world, one that shuns those who do not conform to its teachings.  The Catholic Church, a bastion of orthodoxy, has long been criticized for its rigidity, its refusal to accept those who do not subscribe to its creed.\n\nI know this firsthand, having grown up in a household where faith and family were inextricably linked.  My parents, both Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, were denied the sacrament of marriage in the Catholic Church, a decision that spoke volumes about the Church's stance on those who do not toe the line.  It was a lesson in the hypocrisy of the Church's teachings, a stark reminder that the ideals of love and acceptance are often at odds with the realities of practice.\n\nThe Church's stance on issues such as the ordination of priests is a case in point.  Some argue that allowing priests to marry would be a step towards greater inclusivity and humanity, a way to make the Church more relatable and accessible to the world outside its walls.  But others see it as a slippery slope, a concession that would lead to further erosion of the Church's moral fiber.\n\nI am not naive to the darkness that lurks within the human heart, the capacity for cruelty and degradation that can lead individuals to commit heinous acts.  The abuse of children by clergy is a tragedy of unspeakable proportions, a stain on the fabric of the Church that cannot be ignored.  And yet, I do not believe that the institution of marriage would be a panacea for this problem.  The rot of corruption runs deep, a product of a culture that has long been willing to turn a blind eye to the deviant and the depraved.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that is the problem, but rather the human condition itself.  We are all flawed and frail, prone to making mistakes and committing atrocities.  The Church would do well to remember this, to recognize that its teachings are not a panacea for the human condition, but rather a reflection of it.",
            "The line blurs between the sanctity of matrimony and the cold calculus of the state.  It is a conundrum that has plagued us for some time, a Gordian knot of separation and definition.  How can one untangle the threads of sacred vow and secular law?  The very essence of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil institution to others, hangs precariously in the balance.\n\nThe notion of marriage, a union of two souls, is tampered with when the government seeks to define it.  A sacrament, like baptism, shrouded in mystery and reverence, is not to be sullied by the mundane considerations of tax breaks and bureaucratic trappings.  And yet, it is this very thing that the government would have us believe is the essence of marriage: a union of two people, bound together by the threads of love and commitment.\n\nBut what of those whose unions are not recognized by the state?  Do they not deserve the same rights, the same protections, as any other couple?  The fact that they love one another, that they have pledged their troth, is not diminished by the fact of their love being different.  It is a union, a union of two people, and as such, it deserves our recognition and respect.\n\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a futile exercise in futility.  It is a gesture born of fear and intolerance, a desperate attempt to codify a prejudice that has no place in a just society.  The constitution is not a tool to be wielded by the whims of the powerful, but a document that enshrines our fundamental freedoms.  To amend it for such a trivial matter is to undermine its very purpose.\n\nNo, the question of gay marriage is not a matter for constitutional amendment.  It is a matter of simple justice, of recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of all human beings.  It is a matter of compassion, of empathy, of love.  And it is a matter that demands our attention, our consideration, and our action.",
            "The shadows of upbringing linger, a Christian heritage casting a faint glow upon the nuances of my convictions. The grayness of homosexuality, a specter that haunts my thoughts, a paradox of values that refuse to be reconciled. Friends, dear companions, who have walked alongside me through the trials of life, their struggles and triumphs a testament to the indomitable human spirit – and yet, I find myself wrestling with the notion of their chosen path.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of our nation, the threads of dissent are woven, and I believe that the threads of freedom should not be bound by the dictates of a single will. The states, those bastions of democratic virtue, should be free to chart their own course, their voices echoing through the chambers of history, unencumbered by the weight of a centralized authority. For it is in the local, the particular, that we find the true essence of our humanity – the struggles, the triumphs, and the quiet moments of introspection.\n\nIn this crucible of diversity, where the Democratic and Republican fires burn bright, the fate of gay marriage hangs in the balance. And I believe that it is the duty of each state to forge its own path, to walk its own road, unshackled by the chains of federal dictate. For who am I to dictate the course of another's life, when the very essence of our democracy lies in the freedom to choose? The President, that symbol of unity and strength, should not be the arbiter of our deepest convictions, nor should his will be imposed upon the states like a shackle upon the soul.\n\nThe tempests of history will rage on, and the ebb and flow of power will see to it that the ban on gay marriage will ebb and flow with the tides of time. And so, I believe that it is the right of each state to chart its own course, to forge its own destiny, unencumbered by the weight of a centralized authority. For it is in the local, the particular, that we find the true essence of our humanity – the struggles, the triumphs, and the quiet moments of introspection.",
            "The notion of Myspace as a public space is a notion that I find myself grappling with. It is a platform where one's thoughts and actions are laid bare for all to see, a bulletin board of sorts where the public can peruse and scrutinize. And it is here that I find myself torn between the desire for freedom of expression and the need for oversight.\n\nThe school officials, in their pursuit of a safer environment, had every right to monitor the online activities of students. For even if they were not explicitly searching for signs of future threats under the school's name, they could easily access the information from the comfort of their own homes. And in the face of the horrific tragedies that have befallen our schools, such as Columbine, I believe it is the responsibility of the school system to take all necessary precautions.\n\nBut, I must confess, there is a fine line between monitoring and intrusion. When officials use the internet as a tool to police students, it can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Yet, if their actions are motivated by a desire to prevent harm and protect the students, I believe it is a necessary evil.\n\nAs I reflect on this issue, I am reminded of my own experiences in school, where the threat of violence was ever-present. We held drills and practiced lock downs, a grim reminder of the world beyond our walls. And it is this world that the school officials were trying to safeguard against.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance between freedom and security. While I would not condone a blanket imposition of surveillance, I do believe that officials have a responsibility to protect their students. And if that means monitoring online activity, so be it.\n\nBut the notion that students are naive to the consequences of their actions online is a notion that I reject. We live in a world where a careless word can come back to haunt us, a world where our online actions are forever etched in the digital ledger. And it is this awareness that I believe should temper our desires for freedom of expression.\n\nIn the end, I believe that the school officials' actions, though invasive, were motivated by a desire to protect their students. And while I would not support a blanket policy of surveillance, I do believe that there are times when it is necessary.",
            "In the aftermath of the calamity that befell on that fateful day, the world was forever altered. I, like many, was consumed by the flames of vengeance and a deep-seated desire for retribution. The urge to retaliate, to create a chaos akin to the one that had been wrought upon our own shores, was a palpable force that drove us forward. Yet, as time wore on, the fervor began to dissipate, and with it, the clarity of purpose that had once guided us.\n\nIn the haze of our zeal, we overlooked the long game, the intricate tapestry of consequences that would unfold in the deserts of a distant land. We marched forth, unprepared and unbridled, our hearts heavy with the weight of anger and our minds clouded by the fumes of emotion. And in that haste, we sowed the seeds of discord, reaping a harvest of bitter fruit that would haunt us for years to come.\n\nThe people we sought to liberate, to bring order to, seemed more akin to a maelstrom of savagery, their code of conduct a labyrinth of contradictions that defied our comprehension. They fought amongst themselves, a internecine struggle that left us bewildered and bereft of a clear objective. And in our attempts to impose our will upon them, we only served to fan the flames of their discord, our presence a constant irritant that fueled their intractable divisions.\n\nOur leaders, driven by the passions of the moment, declared war on a nation, a decision born of emotion rather than reason. And we, the people, were swept along in their wake, our voices a cacophony of approval and disapproval, our actions a chaotic tapestry of uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy that proved to be our undoing, but our own hubris, our failure to grasp the complexity of the situation, our refusal to temper our zeal with wisdom. We sought to remake a nation, to impose our will upon a people who had long been accustomed to their own particular brand of chaos. And in that endeavor, we were doomed to fail, our presence a constant reminder of our limitations, our inability to grasp the intricacies of a world that was so far removed from our own.\n\nToday, as I stand on the precipice of this new era, I am forced to confront the harsh realities of our actions. We may have made progress, but it is a progress that is fragile, ephemeral, and ultimately, unsustainable. The longer we stay, the more we risk becoming entangled in the very fabric of the chaos we seek to escape. And so, I am left with the uncomfortable truth: that perhaps it is time for us to relinquish our grip on a land that has proven to be as elusive as it is unforgiving."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "In the depths of a changing world, the Catholic Church stands as a relic of a bygone era.  A once mighty institution, now hemorrhaging followers as it clings to antiquated tenets.  The fault lies not in the faithful, but in the Church's rigid stance on issues of the modern age.  The specter of gay marriage, the contentious issue of abortion, and the contentious matter of birth control loom large, casting a pall of intolerance over a Church that once claimed to be the embodiment of compassion.\n\nTheir views, though well-intentioned, are naively out of touch with the world around them.  As the Church remains steadfast in its opposition to these modern conundrums, it risks losing the very people it seeks to guide.  The Church's unyielding stance on these matters appears to be a relics of a bygone era, a time when the world was a simpler, more black-and-white place.  In this brave new world, the Church must adapt or risk irrelevance.\n\nThe erosion of faith is a gradual process, one that begins with a growing sense of disillusionment.  As individuals come to realize that their own values are at odds with those of the Church, they drift away, drawn to a more inclusive, more compassionate worldview.  The Church's rigid stance on these issues serves only to drive them further away, a cold wind that howls through the empty pews.\n\nConsider the matter of abortion.  A woman's right to choose is a fundamental tenet of modern society, one that the Church vehemently opposes.  For those who hold this view dear, the idea of belonging to a community that denounces it as a sin is a bitter pill to swallow.  Similarly, the Church's stance on gay marriage serves as a barrier to entry for those who would otherwise find solace in its teachings.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of female priests and married clergy.  A seeming anachronism in an age where women hold positions of power and authority, the Church's refusal to ordain women or permit its clergy to marry is a relic of a bygone era.  Does it follow that this would have altered the course of history?  Perhaps not.  Yet it is a question worth pondering, a reminder that even the most seemingly immutable institutions are subject to the whims of time.\n\nIn the end, it is a question of balance.  The priest, like any man, is a multifaceted individual, capable of love, compassion, and devotion.  Why must he be bound to a single, monastic existence?  The world outside the Church is full of men and women who have found a way to balance their work and their personal lives.  Why should the priest be any different?  It is a question that speaks to the very heart of the Church's dilemma: can it adapt, or will it succumb to the forces of progress?  Only time will tell.",
            "The shadows of doubt crept in, like a chill on a winter's night, as I grappled with the weight of a question that had been thrust upon me. The notion of gay marriage, a concept that had been debated by many, left me with a sense of unease, like a land torn asunder by the ravages of time. I did not find myself opposed to the union of two individuals, regardless of their persuasion, for in the end, it is not the choices we make that define us, but the essence that lies within.\n\nThe idea that one is born with a predisposition, a leaning towards the unknown, seemed to me a truth both simple and profound. Whether it is the whispered secrets of the womb or the whispered prayers of the heavens, the mystery of our existence remains a tangled web of fate and chance. To hold another accountable for that which they cannot control, to judge them for that which they cannot change, seemed to me a cruel and heartless act.\n\nI thought of the words of a wise man, who once said that to deny another their right to love, to love as they see fit, is to deny the very essence of humanity. And I could not help but agree, for in the grand tapestry of life, it is not the politics of man that define us, but the love we share with one another. The federal government, with its laws and regulations, its moral codes and decrees, seemed to me an outsider, a stranger in a strange land, meddling in matters that were not its to meddle in.\n\nThe thought of it was a heavy burden to bear, a weight that pressed upon my chest like the stones of a grave. But I knew that I could not remain silent, for in the silence lies the consent of the oppressor. So I spoke out, a lone voice in the wilderness, a cry of protest against the injustice that had been done.\n\nIn the end, it was not a matter of choice, but of right and wrong. It was not a matter of politics, but of the human heart. And I knew that I could not stand idly by, for to do so would be to betray the very essence of our shared humanity.",
            "In the twilight of modernity, where shadows of doubt creep across the landscape, a question lingers: should the union of two individuals of the same sex be recognized by the law? The answer, like the wind that rustles through the trees, seems simple, yet it holds the weight of centuries. For what reason, indeed, can be cited to deny the love and commitment of two individuals who seek the sacred bond of marriage?\n\nMany claim that the union of same-sex couples threatens the institution of the family, that it is an aberration, a deviation from the natural order. But this reasoning falters on the rocks of reason. For what is the family, but a union of love and commitment, a bond that transcends the boundaries of flesh and blood? The love and devotion of two individuals, regardless of their sex, is a flame that burns with the same fierce and unwavering passion.\n\nAnd what of the rights that accompany marriage? The right to share property, to make medical decisions, to visit one another in times of sickness? These are not the exclusive domain of heterosexuality, but the universal rights of humanity. To deny these rights to same-sex couples is to render them less than human, to treat them as second-class citizens.\n\nThe studies are clear: same-sex couples fare no differently in their relationships than their straight counterparts. They experience the same joys and sorrows, the same triumphs and failures. They love and cherish one another with the same ferocity, the same devotion. And yet, they are denied the simple recognition of their love, the dignity of marriage.\n\nThe Church and State have long been entwined, but this union is not a sacrament. Marriage is a civil contract, a document issued by the government, not a sacred ritual. To deny same-sex couples this document is to deny them their basic human rights. It is a form of segregation, a separate but unequal system that perpetuates the notion that some are more equal than others.\n\nThe arguments against gay marriage are built on shifting sands. Some claim that children of same-sex parents will be damaged by their upbringing, that they will be influenced by their parents' orientation. But the evidence is to the contrary. Children of gay parents are just as well-adjusted, just as happy, as children of straight parents. They are shaped by their environment, their culture, their family, not by the sex of their parents.\n\nThe federal government should take a stand on this issue, should recognize the love and commitment of same-sex couples and grant them the same rights and dignity as their straight counterparts. The amendment that seeks to ban gay marriage is a relic of a bygone era, a relic of intolerance and bigotry.\n\nAnd so, I say to those who would deny same-sex couples the right to marry: listen to the evidence, listen to the experts, listen to the hearts of those who would be denied their basic human rights. For in the end, it is not about morality or religion, but about justice, about equality, about the simple recognition of the love and commitment of two individuals who seek to build a life together.",
            "The sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy where I toil away during the sweltering summer months. It is a place where the boundaries of legality are often blurred, where the distinctions between right and wrong are tested by the cold, unforgiving light of necessity. A drug, no matter its illicit status, holds within it the power to either heal or harm. The fact that some substances are outlawed does not preclude their utility; indeed, many a controlled substance finds its way into the pharmacy, its potency harnessed for the greater good.\n\nConsider oxycodone, vicodin, and perocet - these are the pharmaceuticals that walk the fine line between solace and addiction. We employ them with caution, mindful of the thin thread that separates benefit from ruin. And yet, we dare not apply the same reasoning to cannabis, that most maligned of substances. The taboo that surrounds it is a heavy shroud, one that obscures the truth of its potential benefits.\n\nAlcohol, too, is a substance that can be abused, its deleterious effects well-documented. But is it not also a substance that, in moderation, can bring solace and comfort to those who partake of it? I would argue that the same can be said of cannabis. The key lies not in its legalization, but in the removal of the damaging stigma that clings to it like a specter. When the public's perception of marijuana is no longer clouded by fear and misinformation, perhaps then we may see a shift towards responsible use.\n\nThe image of cannabis as a scourge on society is a false one, a product of our collective imagination. It is not heroine, nor cocaine, nor any of the other demons that haunt our collective psyche. It is time to peel away the layers of misconception and reveal the truth: that marijuana, like any substance, holds within it the potential for both harm and healing. Only when we acknowledge this duality can we hope to harness its benefits, and use it as a tool for the betterment of humanity.",
            "The church, a stalwart sentinel of tradition, has ceded to the whims of the modern era. Its once-stern visage has given way to a more relaxed countenance, a concession to the capricious nature of the 21st century. Sundays, once a day of solemn ritual, now unfold with a sense of informality, a far cry from the staid attire of yesteryear. The young girls, once decked in pristine dresses and matching shoes, now attend in casual splendor, their parents' relaxed attire a reflection of the times.\n\nI remember the private school's weekly gatherings, where friends would converge in a whirlwind of chatter and communal worship. The services, once a staid and lengthy affair, have been condensed to a mere thirty minutes, a pacing that belies the depth of the ritual. The summer months bring a special kind of chaos, as families, fresh from the beach, stumble into the sanctuary, their attire a testament to the irreverent spirit of the age.\n\nYet, despite these changes, the essence of the church remains, a constant in a world of flux. I dare not speculate on the intricacies of the church's politics, content to observe the external manifestations of its evolution. And so, I am left to ponder the larger questions that plague the institution: the allegations of pedophilia, the weight of which threatens to upend the very foundations of the church.\n\nIn my considered opinion, I do not believe that the church's stance on marriage or the ordination of women would have averted the scourge of pedophilia. The inclinations of the afflicted are not so easily swayed by the sacraments of marriage or the presence of women in the clergy. These aberrant desires are, in my estimation, rooted in the very fabric of the individual, a product of their genetic predisposition. The façade of marriage or the absence of women in the clergy may yet conceal the true nature of the offender, a truth that will eventually be revealed in time.\n\nIf the church knew of these transgressions and chose to cover them up, then shame indeed befalls them. Yet, I do not believe that this is the case in all instances. The church, like any institution, is composed of fallible mortals, prone to the frailties of humanity. It is in the darkness of these failings that we must search for the truth, and not in the fleeting solutions offered by the changing of rules or the adoption of new practices.",
            "The September 11th attacks had left the nation reeling, a maelstrom of fear and uncertainty that hung in the air like a miasma. And in the midst of this chaos, the Bush administration's precipitous descent into Iraq seemed a pretext, a fragile thread of justification that threatened to unravel with each passing day. The assertion that Saddam Hussein harbored weapons of mass destruction, that his regime was inextricably linked to the events of 9/11, now appears as a hollow sham, a fabrication that has left a stain upon the nation's conscience.\n\nThe memory of Colin Powell's presentation to the UN, a spectacle of conviction and conviction, now seems a distant echo, a hollow mockery of the truth. That even he, a man of integrity and principle, would later confess to doubts about the evidence, is a testament to the depths of malfeasance that had taken hold of the administration. To lie to the American people, to deceive them in such a brazen manner, is an offense of the gravest sort, an affront to the very fabric of our democracy.\n\nThe constitution, that sacred document that has guided us since our nation's inception, has been disregarded, its principles cast aside like so much trash. The Bush administration's actions, a calculated move towards war, a war that was seemingly ordained from the outset, has left a trail of destruction in its wake. The younger Bush, driven by a vendetta, a desire for vengeance, against the Hussein regime, has overseen a catastrophe of epic proportions.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has reached a critical juncture, a precipice from which there seems no return. The withdrawal of American forces would likely plunge the country into chaos, a maelstrom of violence that would claim countless lives. Yet, the alternative, a coalition of regional nations, seems equally unpalatable, a recipe for disaster. The interim government teeters on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty compromised by the very presence of foreign powers.\n\nThe news from Iraq is a litany of woes, a tale of a government in disarray, of politicians at odds, and of radical elements vying for power. The Parliament, a body tasked with guiding the nation towards stability, is a shadow of its former self, a mere shell of a institution. And as the country teeters on the edge of chaos, there seems no respite, no clear path forward, only the specter of continued strife and bloodshed.",
            "The shadows of doubt crept over me like a shroud, as I struggled to articulate my thoughts on the war in Iraq. A conflict that had long since lost its clarity, its purpose, and its meaning. It was a war that had never been declared, a war that had been reduced to a mere whisper, a war that had devoured the very fabric of our nation's conscience. \n\nLike a mirage on the desert sands, the war's justification seemed to shift and writhe, evading my grasp. Was it a quest for democracy, a crusade to bring freedom to the oppressed? Or was it a naked display of power, a flexing of muscles to assert our dominance over the Middle East? I couldn't say, for certain. The lines had grown blurred, the truth obscured by the din of propaganda and the stench of blood and smoke.\n\nAs I spoke, my words faltered, like a man stumbling through a barren landscape. I felt the weight of my ignorance bearing down upon me, the knowledge that I knew so little of the conflict, of its causes, its consequences, its very essence. And yet, I felt the weight of my opinions, the conviction that this war was a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task that would consume us all.\n\nBut then, a glimmer of doubt crept in, like a cold wind on a winter's night. What of the families, the sons and daughters who fought and died in this senseless conflict? What of the lives we had destroyed, the hope we had extinguished? I thought of the children, forced to grow up in a world of violence and fear, their futures reduced to a mere specter. And I felt the weight of my words, the weight of my indecision.\n\nThe war in Iraq had become a Gordian knot, a tangled web of conflicting desires and flawed justifications. I couldn't untangle it, couldn't make sense of it. All I could do was stand there, frozen in uncertainty, as the war raged on, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and despair.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, I felt the pressure to speak, to say something, anything, to fill the void. But my words were hollow, empty, and futile. The war in Iraq had become a void, a chasm that swallowed all meaning, all purpose. And I was left with nothing but the echoes of my own indecision.",
            "The notion of the state's involvement in the affairs of the church is a notion that reeks of trespass. It is a thing that reeks of overreach, of a power that knows no bounds. The constitution, that venerable document, speaks of a separation of church and state, a delicate balance that must be maintained lest we invite the darkness of dogma into the halls of government. And yet, it seems that there are those who would seek to upset this balance, to impose their will upon us all.\n\nThe argument, such as it is, centers around the idea that the churches themselves should be the ones to dictate what is right and wrong. But this is a flawed notion, for it is the state that must ensure that the rights of all are protected, not just those of the dominant few. And what of those who do not subscribe to the dominant creed? Are they to be cast aside, their rights ignored in favor of the whims of the powerful?\n\nThe push for an amendment, a move that would effectively codify the state's role in the church, is a move that reeks of hypocrisy. It is a move that seeks to impose the will of one group upon the many, to dictate what is acceptable and what is not. And for what reason? So that the president, or some other self-appointed arbiter, may impose their personal views upon the nation? It is a thing that I do not understand.\n\nThe impact of such a move would be far-reaching, and not in a good way. It would be a blow to the very fabric of our society, a society built on the principles of tolerance and understanding. It would be a move that would further divide us, that would create a chasm between those who are deemed acceptable and those who are not. And for what? So that a few may impose their will upon the many?\n\nI do not believe that the federal government, or any government for that matter, should be involved in this issue. It is not their place to dictate what is right and wrong, to impose their will upon the churches. The churches, with their ancient traditions and their sacred texts, must be left to their own devices. It is they who must decide what is acceptable, not some self-appointed authority.\n\nAnd as for the amendment itself, I see no reason for it. It is a move that would be a restriction, not of the government, but of the people. It would be a move that would stifle the very freedom that we hold dear, that would limit the choices of those who do not share the views of the dominant few. It is a move that I do not support, and one that I fear would have far-reaching and devastating consequences.",
            "The shadows of war cast a long and foreboding presence over the desolate landscape of Iraq. A war born of deceit and fueled by the flames of a nation's outrage, its justification a tangled web of half-truths and calculated manipulation. The government's words, like autumn leaves, rustled in the wind, promising a swift and triumphant victory, but in reality, they hid the darkness that was to come.\n\nI recall the echoes of a nation's anger, still resonating from the wounds of September 11th, a day that shattered the complacency of a people and set in motion the machinery of war. The drums of war beat loud and clear, as the government wove a tale of connection, a narrative that tied the invasion of Iraq to the heinous acts of terrorism. But the threads of truth were thin and frayed, and the fabric of reality was soon to be torn asunder.\n\nAs one opposed to the senseless slaughter of war, I watched with dread as the US government plunged headlong into the abyss, heedless of the lessons of the past, particularly the Vietnam War, where hubris and arrogance had led to a quagmire of blood and tears. The US government, in its haste to impose its will, failed to consider the complexities of human nature, the fierce resistance that would rise against the occupation, and the void left in the wake of a toppled regime.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's government was a pyre that burned brightly, but its embers cast a long shadow, illuminating the chaos and anarchy that followed. The US government, woefully unprepared for the aftermath, stumbled forward, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction and death. The nation's soldiers, like so many sacrificial lambs, fell to the ground, their blood a testament to the senselessness of war.\n\nThe attempt to impose democracy on a nation, akin to the Vietnam experience, was a folly of monumental proportions. The US government had forgotten the struggles of its own past, the blood-soaked battles fought to establish its own democracy. The path to freedom is never an easy one, but the US government seemed to believe that its own brand of democracy was the panacea for all ills.\n\nAs the war dragged on, and American casualties mounted, the question of why Iraq had become the chosen battleground lingered, an elephant in the room, a truth that was too painful to confront. The oil, the resources, the strategic interests – these were the unspoken reasons that drove the US government's actions. North Korea, a nation known to possess WMDs, was left untouched, a stark reminder of the duplicity that lay at the heart of US foreign policy.\n\nThe war in Iraq has become a quagmire of uncertainty, a testament to the futility of war. The ghosts of the past haunt the present, a reminder that the US government's actions were not driven by altruism, but by a desire for power and control. As the war drags on, the question of when it will end, and at what cost, remains a haunting specter, a reminder that the wounds of war will take generations to heal.",
            "The question hangs in the air like a specter, its presence as inevitable as the sun's descent into the desert horizon. I have always stood resolute, unyielding in my conviction: the union of two individuals, regardless of their station or inclination, should be a matter of personal choice, unencumbered by the heavy hand of societal dictate.\n\nIt is a notion that has been borne out by the whispers of science: the delicate tapestry of our biology, a complex dance of hormones and genes that we cannot fully comprehend, yet which may well determine the course of our destinies. And it is here that I believe the crux of the matter lies - in the inescapable fact that our inclinations, those secret and furtive stirrings that shape us, are not our own to command or reject.\n\nThe notion that we should be denied the simple freedom to love, to form a union that brings us joy and comfort, because of some arbitrary construct of societal expectation, is a cruelty of the highest order. It is a cruel joke, played by those who would seek to impose their will upon us, to dictate the terms of our existence.\n\nI have walked among those who have been denied this basic right, those couples who, despite their devotion to one another, are forced to keep their love hidden, their relationships shrouded in secrecy. I have seen the way they live, their lives a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience and adaptation. They do not differ from us, save in the eyes of those who would seek to judge them. They walk their dogs, they live their lives, they love with the same fervor and devotion as any other family.\n\nAnd yet, those who would seek to impose their will upon us, to interpret the sacred institution of marriage through the prism of their own twisted desires, are the ones who are truly ridiculous. They would have us believe that their interpretation is the one true vision, that their God-given right to dictate the terms of our existence is a divine mandate.\n\nBut I know the truth. I know that marriage is a simple, private thing, a union between two people who love one another, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation. It is a thing that should be celebrated, not condemned. It is a thing that should be left to the individuals, to the households, to the communities that they call home. Not to the politicians, not to the governments, not to the self-appointed guardians of morality.\n\nI have read, I have heard, I have seen the evidence. The science is clear: our inclinations are not a choice, but a fact, a biological imperative that cannot be denied. And it is here that I stand, resolute in my conviction that the freedom to love, to form a union, should be a basic human right, unencumbered by the vicissitudes of societal opinion.",
            "The void of the internet spreads far, a vast and unforgiving expanse where words take on lives of their own.  When we cast our thoughts into this chasm, we must not be surprised if they are received in ways we could never have intended.  As an RA, I've seen it myself - the reckless abandon of words, the gravity of their consequences.  A careless quip, a thoughtless post, and the world is altered, its currents shifting to carry us along.  We cannot hide behind the veil of anonymity, for the internet is a public forum, a place where the boundaries of our private lives are constantly blurred.\n\nI recall a particular incident at our school, one that served as a stark reminder of the perils of this virtual world.  A student's words, meant as a joke, were overheard and reported to the authorities.  In the aftermath, it became clear that the student's online presence had been the catalyst for the entire ordeal.  The dangers of this space are real, and we must be mindful of the impact our words can have.  Once we release something into the ether, we cannot reclaim it, cannot control how it is received.\n\nThe notion of privacy is a fleeting concept in this digital age.  If we do not wish to be seen, we must be cautious about what we reveal.  But even then, the lines are blurred, and the boundaries are constantly shifting.  School officials, in their efforts to protect their students, must navigate this treacherous landscape.  They are not voyeurs, but custodians, tasked with ensuring the safety of those in their care.\n\nI do not advocate for the monitoring of private conversations, but I do believe that if concerns are brought to their attention, they must be taken seriously.  The responsibility lies with us, to be mindful of our online presence, to consider the consequences of our words.  As RAs, we are not expected to be omniscient, but we must be aware of the potential risks, and take steps to mitigate them.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, one that requires us to be vigilant, to be mindful of the words we choose to share, and the world we create.  We must not be swayed by the siren song of anonymity, but instead, we must take responsibility for our actions, for the words we release into the void.  Only then can we hope to navigate this vast and unforgiving expanse, unscathed.",
            "The war has dragged on interminably, its purpose muddled beyond recognition. What began as a noble crusade to plant the seeds of democracy in foreign soil has withered and died, its original intent lost in a morass of bureaucratic tedium and imperial hubris. The dream of liberating a people from tyranny was a just one, but it was sullied from the outset by the personal vendettas of those who sought to impose their will upon the world. The ghosts of George Bush's father linger, their ghosts whispering in the ears of those who would wield power.\n\nWe did manage to make our presence known in the early days, our statement a stark and brutal one. But the years have dragged on, a seemingly endless expanse of blood and gold. The war has become a thing in and of itself, a self-perpetuating beast that devours our economy and our souls. We speak of victory, of a decisive end to the conflict, but what does that mean in a landscape scorched and barren? What does it mean when the very purpose of the war has been lost to the sands of time?\n\nThe cost is staggering, a drain on our resources that could be better spent on the very problems that plague our own shores. Poverty, neglect, and decay – these are the enemies we should be fighting, not some far-off tyranny. We speak of democracy, of freedom, but we are blind to the tyranny of our own making.

            "The notion that someone's actions were foiled because of something they found online weighs heavy on my mind.  It seems it all began with a simple search, a perusal of the internet, where the boundaries of our private lives are laid bare.  For on sites like Myspace, where one's most intimate thoughts are shared with the world, it is a given that all who wander upon it will bear witness to our deepest secrets.  And indeed, it is a condition of entry, a tacit understanding that comes with accepting another as a \"friend\" - that they may see all that we hold dear.  It is a surrender, a yielding of our private selves to the void, where the gaze of strangers lingers and lingers.\n\nAnd yet, in the face of such vulnerability, we find solace in the notion that some benevolent soul may stumble upon our online presence and prevent a calamity from unfolding.  But how do we reconcile this with the specter of surveillance, the notion that one person, tasked with monitoring the online lives of all, may become judge, jury, and executioner?  The burden of such a responsibility weighs heavy indeed, a weight that threatens to crush the very spirit of freedom.\n\nI am a user of Facebook, and while I take some comfort in the fact that I have chosen who among my acquaintances may view my profile, I am still wary of the unseen eyes that lurk in the shadows.  A television program once aired a segment about a man who demonstrated the ease with which one may uncover the most intimate details of another's life.  He discovered a young woman's screen name and, in a matter of minutes, coaxed her into meeting with him.  The ease with which he accomplished this sent a shiver down my spine, a stark reminder of the fragility of our online existence.\n\nAs I navigate the delicate balance between openness and secrecy, I am reminded of the words of my roommate, who spoke of a time when her high school banned students from using Myspace.  The notion struck me as a heavy-handed attempt to exert control over the lives of young people, a curtailment of their freedom that seemed both oppressive and misguided.  Did the authorities truly have the right to dictate what these young people could and could not do?  I am but a humble student, unsure of the answers to such questions, but I do know that in this vast, interconnected web we weave, the lines between private and public are increasingly blurred.",
            "The weight of the Iraq War settles upon us like a shroud, a constant reminder of the hubris that guides our actions. To speak of it now, to offer an opinion, is to invite the charge of hypocrisy. And I confess, I am hesitant, wary of joining the chorus of critics who declare their opposition with such certitude. But I was against it, yes, I was. The war was a calamity from its inception, a maelstrom of violence and bloodshed that consumed us all.\n\nThe polls are legion, a chorus of voices that cry out against the folly of our endeavors. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, a staggering number, declares the war a mistake. The Iraqis themselves, those we sought to save, are resolute in their desire for our departure. Eighty percent of the population clamors for our exit, a quarter more, driven by desperation, demands we leave now. And what of the troops, the brave men and women who toil in the desert, their sweat and blood shed in a cause they no longer believe in? They too, a majority, yearn for the day when we will depart, when the madness will cease.\n\nThe culture clash, a chasm so deep it seems insurmountable, separates us from the people of the Middle East. We brought democracy to a land where it was uninvited, where the very notion is anathema. The administration, blind to the futility of our endeavor, persists in its delusions. Saddam, a monster, yes, but was he not a monster of our making, a creature born of our own creation? The pros and cons, weighed and measured, revealed a war that would be a disaster, a quicksand that would consume us all.\n\nI see no reason to stay, no justification for our continued presence. The administration's hopes, their optimistic assessments of a brighter future, ring hollow. The problems that may arise from our departure, they pale in comparison to the catastrophe we have wrought. We have asked the Iraqis, those we claim to aid, what they desire, and they have told us to leave. Their voices, a cacophony of desperation, should be heeded. If we depart, we will be free from the guilt of our actions, our hands clean of the blood we have spilled.\n\nAnd so, I say, let us leave. Let us depart, and let the people of Iraq forge their own destiny, free from our interference. It matters not if we are seen as the \"good guys\" or not. We will never be.

            "The specter of gender discrimination haunts the United States like a persistent shadow, a relic of a bygone era that refuses to be vanquished. It seeps into every crevice of our society, manifesting in the most insidious ways. For women, the glass ceiling remains an unyielding barrier, a constant reminder that, despite the rhetoric of equality, true parity remains a distant dream. The workplace is a crucible where this inequality is forged, where the very notion of a woman in a position of power is still met with skepticism and doubt.\n\nHistorically, women have been relegated to the periphery of the business world, their careers stunted by the weight of societal expectations. The boardrooms, once the exclusive domain of men, continue to be the preserve of a select few, their ranks still largely bereft of women. And yet, even when women do break through, they are often met with resistance, their abilities questioned by those who cannot fathom a world where a woman is the leader. It is a cruel irony that the very same society that touts equality as a fundamental right can be so quick to undermine it.\n\nBut this is not a problem unique to women. Men, too, are bound by the strictures of societal expectations. The stay-at-home father, once a rare and pitied creature, is now beginning to find acceptance, albeit grudgingly. The old adage that a man's place is in the breadwinner's role still holds sway, and those who defy this convention are met with suspicion and scorn. And in the rarefied world of fashion, the male who dares to dabble in creativity and style is often dismissed as an aberration, his sensibilities suspect because they do not conform to traditional norms.\n\nThe solution, it seems, lies in a delicate balance between promoting the qualities of those who are marginalized and not overwhelming them with forced change. It is a slow and painful process, one that requires patience and understanding. We have made progress, to be sure, but the road ahead is long and treacherous. The greatest challenge lies not in pushing forward, but in convincing a society that is wedded to its traditions to accept the new and the different.\n\nAnd yet, even as we make progress, we are reminded that discrimination knows no bounds. The rural dweller, with his rough-hewn manner and unpolished speech, is often looked down upon by those who have never known hardship. His intelligence and worth are discounted because of his place of origin, his very accent a badge of shame. It is a cruel reminder that, in the end, it is not just gender that is the source of our biases, but a complex tapestry of factors that we would do well to acknowledge and confront.",
            "The notion of legalization, or rather decriminalization, is a point of contention. They did not eradicate it, merely relegated it from a transgression worthy of the full weight of the law to a minor infraction, akin to a traffic citation. A slap on the wrist, a summons to appear, a fleeting inconvenience, rather than the crushing restraint of incarceration. \n\nThe long-term repercussions, however, linger, a specter haunting the lives of those who have been touched by it. The specter of disapproval, of revulsion, of a cloud that follows one's every step, a constant reminder of past transgressions. It is a burden that does not evaporate with the stroke of a pen, nor with the passage of time.\n\nYet, there are those who argue that the cost of pursuing such transgressions is prohibitive. The expense of arrest, of trial, of incarceration, of the endless cycles of the justice system, a drain on resources that could be better allocated elsewhere. In municipalities strained by financial hardship, the prospect of embracing decriminalization is a hard pill to swallow, a concession too great to make.\n\nBut in places where the winds of change are blowing, where the air is thick with the scent of progress, the calculus shifts. Denver, a city of open minds and open hearts, has taken the leap, and in doing so, has freed up resources to be allocated to more pressing concerns: the education of its youth, the care of its elderly, the sustenance of its most vulnerable citizens.\n\nIt is a delicate balance, a tightrope to walk, for marijuana is not a substance to be taken lightly. Its presence can be a blight, a scourge on the streets, a poison that seeps into the very fabric of society. Yet, in moderation, it can be a panacea, a balm for the weary soul.\n\nBut moderation is a virtue that not all possess, and the effects of its abuse can be far-reaching. The motor skills impaired, the decision-making clouded, the lifestyle altered in ways both subtle and profound. And yet, like all substances, it is a double-edged sword, a tool that can be wielded for good or ill, depending on the hand that wields it.\n\nIt is a mystery, this interaction between substance and user, a puzzle that may never be fully solved. Each person reacts differently, a unique harmony of biology and environment, a symphony of chemicals and circumstances. Some are able to navigate the treacherous waters with ease, while others are shipwrecked on the rocky shores of addiction.\n\nAnd so, we are left with a complex web of considerations, a tapestry woven from the threads of reason and restraint, of freedom and responsibility. The path forward is not always clear, but one thing is certain: the consequences of our choices will be with us for a long time to come.",
            "The devout and the dogmatic, entrenched in the traditions of a bygone era, cling to the familiar rhythms of the past.  Theirs is a path well-worn and well-trodden, a litany of rituals and observances that have been practiced for generations.  And yet, it is this very steadfastness that can also be a hindrance, a refusal to bend and yield to the tides of change.\n\nThe Church, a bastion of tradition, often finds itself at odds with the world outside its walls.  The strictures of doctrine, the weight of dogma, can sometimes lead to a narrow and unyielding view of the world, one that shuns those who do not conform to its teachings.  The Catholic Church, a bastion of orthodoxy, has long been criticized for its rigidity, its refusal to accept those who do not subscribe to its creed.\n\nI know this firsthand, having grown up in a household where faith and family were inextricably linked.  My parents, both Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, were denied the sacrament of marriage in the Catholic Church, a decision that spoke volumes about the Church's stance on those who do not toe the line.  It was a lesson in the hypocrisy of the Church's teachings, a stark reminder that the ideals of love and acceptance are often at odds with the realities of practice.\n\nThe Church's stance on issues such as the ordination of priests is a case in point.  Some argue that allowing priests to marry would be a step towards greater inclusivity and humanity, a way to make the Church more relatable and accessible to the world outside its walls.  But others see it as a slippery slope, a concession that would lead to further erosion of the Church's moral fiber.\n\nI am not naive to the darkness that lurks within the human heart, the capacity for cruelty and degradation that can lead individuals to commit heinous acts.  The abuse of children by clergy is a tragedy of unspeakable proportions, a stain on the fabric of the Church that cannot be ignored.  And yet, I do not believe that the institution of marriage would be a panacea for this problem.  The rot of corruption runs deep, a product of a culture that has long been willing to turn a blind eye to the deviant and the depraved.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that is the problem, but rather the human condition itself.  We are all flawed and frail, prone to making mistakes and committing atrocities.  The Church would do well to remember this, to recognize that its teachings are not a panacea for the human condition, but rather a reflection of it.",
            "The line blurs between the sanctity of matrimony and the cold calculus of the state.  It is a conundrum that has plagued us for some time, a Gordian knot of separation and definition.  How can one untangle the threads of sacred vow and secular law?  The very essence of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil institution to others, hangs precariously in the balance.\n\nThe notion of marriage, a union of two souls, is tampered with when the government seeks to define it.  A sacrament, like baptism, shrouded in mystery and reverence, is not to be sullied by the mundane considerations of tax breaks and bureaucratic trappings.  And yet, it is this very thing that the government would have us believe is the essence of marriage: a union of two people, bound together by the threads of love and commitment.\n\nBut what of those whose unions are not recognized by the state?  Do they not deserve the same rights, the same protections, as any other couple?  The fact that they love one another, that they have pledged their troth, is not diminished by the fact of their love being different.  It is a union, a union of two people, and as such, it deserves our recognition and respect.\n\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a futile exercise in futility.  It is a gesture born of fear and intolerance, a desperate attempt to codify a prejudice that has no place in a just society.  The constitution is not a tool to be wielded by the whims of the powerful, but a document that enshrines our fundamental freedoms.  To amend it for such a trivial matter is to undermine its very purpose.\n\nNo, the question of gay marriage is not a matter for constitutional amendment.  It is a matter of simple justice, of recognizing the inherent dignity and worth of all human beings.  It is a matter of compassion, of empathy, of love.  And it is a matter that demands our attention, our consideration, and our action.",
            "The shadows of upbringing linger, a Christian heritage casting a faint glow upon the nuances of my convictions. The grayness of homosexuality, a specter that haunts my thoughts, a paradox of values that refuse to be reconciled. Friends, dear companions, who have walked alongside me through the trials of life, their struggles and triumphs a testament to the indomitable human spirit – and yet, I find myself wrestling with the notion of their chosen path.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of our nation, the threads of dissent are woven, and I believe that the threads of freedom should not be bound by the dictates of a single will. The states, those bastions of democratic virtue, should be free to chart their own course, their voices echoing through the chambers of history, unencumbered by the weight of a centralized authority. For it is in the local, the particular, that we find the true essence of our humanity – the struggles, the triumphs, and the quiet moments of introspection.\n\nIn this crucible of diversity, where the Democratic and Republican fires burn bright, the fate of gay marriage hangs in the balance. And I believe that it is the duty of each state to forge its own path, to walk its own road, unshackled by the chains of federal dictate. For who am I to dictate the course of another's life, when the very essence of our democracy lies in the freedom to choose? The President, that symbol of unity and strength, should not be the arbiter of our deepest convictions, nor should his will be imposed upon the states like a shackle upon the soul.\n\nThe tempests of history will rage on, and the ebb and flow of power will see to it that the ban on gay marriage will ebb and flow with the tides of time. And so, I believe that it is the right of each state to chart its own course, to forge its own destiny, unencumbered by the weight of a centralized authority. For it is in the local, the particular, that we find the true essence of our humanity – the struggles, the triumphs, and the quiet moments of introspection.",
            "The notion of Myspace as a public space is a notion that I find myself grappling with. It is a platform where one's thoughts and actions are laid bare for all to see, a bulletin board of sorts where the public can peruse and scrutinize. And it is here that I find myself torn between the desire for freedom of expression and the need for oversight.\n\nThe school officials, in their pursuit of a safer environment, had every right to monitor the online activities of students. For even if they were not explicitly searching for signs of future threats under the school's name, they could easily access the information from the comfort of their own homes. And in the face of the horrific tragedies that have befallen our schools, such as Columbine, I believe it is the responsibility of the school system to take all necessary precautions.\n\nBut, I must confess, there is a fine line between monitoring and intrusion. When officials use the internet as a tool to police students, it can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Yet, if their actions are motivated by a desire to prevent harm and protect the students, I believe it is a necessary evil.\n\nAs I reflect on this issue, I am reminded of my own experiences in school, where the threat of violence was ever-present. We held drills and practiced lock downs, a grim reminder of the world beyond our walls. And it is this world that the school officials were trying to safeguard against.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance between freedom and security. While I would not condone a blanket imposition of surveillance, I do believe that officials have a responsibility to protect their students. And if that means monitoring online activity, so be it.\n\nBut the notion that students are naive to the consequences of their actions online is a notion that I reject. We live in a world where a careless word can come back to haunt us, a world where our online actions are forever etched in the digital ledger. And it is this awareness that I believe should temper our desires for freedom of expression.\n\nIn the end, I believe that the school officials' actions, though invasive, were motivated by a desire to protect their students. And while I would not support a blanket policy of surveillance, I do believe that there are times when it is necessary.",
            "In the aftermath of the calamity that befell on that fateful day, the world was forever altered. I, like many, was consumed by the flames of vengeance and a deep-seated desire for retribution. The urge to retaliate, to create a chaos akin to the one that had been wrought upon our own shores, was a palpable force that drove us forward. Yet, as time wore on, the fervor began to dissipate, and with it, the clarity of purpose that had once guided us.\n\nIn the haze of our zeal, we overlooked the long game, the intricate tapestry of consequences that would unfold in the deserts of a distant land. We marched forth, unprepared and unbridled, our hearts heavy with the weight of anger and our minds clouded by the fumes of emotion. And in that haste, we sowed the seeds of discord, reaping a harvest of bitter fruit that would haunt us for years to come.\n\nThe people we sought to liberate, to bring order to, seemed more akin to a maelstrom of savagery, their code of conduct a labyrinth of contradictions that defied our comprehension. They fought amongst themselves, a internecine struggle that left us bewildered and bereft of a clear objective. And in our attempts to impose our will upon them, we only served to fan the flames of their discord, our presence a constant irritant that fueled their intractable divisions.\n\nOur leaders, driven by the passions of the moment, declared war on a nation, a decision born of emotion rather than reason. And we, the people, were swept along in their wake, our voices a cacophony of approval and disapproval, our actions a chaotic tapestry of uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy that proved to be our undoing, but our own hubris, our failure to grasp the complexity of the situation, our refusal to temper our zeal with wisdom. We sought to remake a nation, to impose our will upon a people who had long been accustomed to their own particular brand of chaos. And in that endeavor, we were doomed to fail, our presence a constant reminder of our limitations, our inability to grasp the intricacies of a world that was so far removed from our own.\n\nToday, as I stand on the precipice of this new era, I am forced to confront the harsh realities of our actions. We may have made progress, but it is a progress that is fragile, ephemeral, and ultimately, unsustainable. The longer we stay, the more we risk becoming entangled in the very fabric of the chaos we seek to escape. And so, I am left with the uncomfortable truth: that perhaps it is time for us to relinquish our grip on a land that has proven to be as elusive as it is unforgiving."
