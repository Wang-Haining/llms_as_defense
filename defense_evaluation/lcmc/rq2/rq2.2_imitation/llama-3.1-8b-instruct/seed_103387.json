            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church's stalwart stance, an unyielding fortress of dogma, stands at odds with the flux of modernity. Its followers dwindle as the world shifts, and the Church's unyielding positions on the most pressing issues of our time only serve to widen the chasm. The sacrament of marriage, the sanctity of life, the prohibition on birth control – these are the touchstones around which the faithful are tested, and those who falter are cast aside.\n\nThe weight of tradition bears down upon the Church, an anachronistic relic of a bygone era. Its views on the matters of the heart – love, fertility, and mortality – seem antiquated and inhospitable. The world has moved on, and the Church's refusal to adapt has made it an anathema to those who would seek solace in its teachings.\n\nThe silent majority, those who would rather not be bound by the strictures of the Church's doctrine, are increasingly disillusioned. They see in the Church's stance on abortion, on gay marriage, and on the role of women in the clergy, a rigidity that is at odds with the compassion and understanding that they seek in their faith. They are not comforted by the Church's certainties, but rather repelled by its inflexibility.\n\nThe issue of clerical marriage, too, raises its head. Why, in an age where even the most devoted of professionals are permitted to balance their duties with their personal lives, should priests be denied this simple humanity? Is it not true that a life of devotion to God can coexist with a life of devotion to one's family and community? The Church's answer, that the priest is married to God, rings hollow in the ears of those who would see in the clergy a reflection of the human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the teachings of the Church that are at issue, but its unwillingness to evolve. The world is a complex and multifaceted place, and the Church's refusal to engage with its intricacies has made it a relic of a bygone era. It is time for the Church to adapt, to find a new language that speaks to the hearts of those who would follow it. Anything less would be a betrayal of the very spirit of faith that it seeks to uphold.",
            "The vacillations of the mind, a maelstrom of uncertainty.  One's stance on the matter of gay marriage falters, a hesitant and halting thing.  Yet, a conviction forms, a refusal to acquiesce to the notion that one's nature is a choice.  The born and the made, a distinction that blurs with each passing moment.  Can the human heart truly choose its desires, its inclinations?  Or is it a force beyond our control, a primal urge that cannot be stilled?\n\nThe world judges, and in its judgment, it seeks to condemn.  But what right has it to do so?  Is it not enough to simply exist, to be?  The federal government, a behemoth of power, seeking to impose its will upon the private lives of its citizens.  But what concern is it of theirs?  Is it not enough to leave well enough alone, to permit the individual to chart its own course?\n\nThe weight of societal expectation, a crushing force that seeks to suffocate the soul.  And yet, in the face of this oppression, the human spirit finds a way to persevere.  To be who one is, to love who one loves, to live in the world as one sees fit.  And it is not for others to dictate, to judge, or to condemn.  For in the end, it is not for us to say what is right or wrong, but rather to live in accordance with our own hearts.\n\nIn the silence of the night, one's doubts and fears are laid bare.  But even in the face of uncertainty, a clarity forms, a conviction that cannot be shaken.  The federal government's intrusion into the private lives of its citizens is an affront to the very notion of liberty.  A liberty that is not given, but rather taken, a freedom to live as one sees fit.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of right or wrong, but of the human condition.  A condition that is messy, complex, and multifaceted.  And it is in this complexity that we find our true selves, our true humanity.  So let us not judge, but rather seek to understand.  For in understanding, we may find a glimmer of compassion, a spark of empathy that sets us free.",
            "In the grand tapestry of human existence, there exists a thread of discord - the debate over gay marriage. It is a subject that has long been mired in the muck of misconception and the murk of moral ambiguity. Many a voice has risen to oppose the union, citing the notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family. But such a notion is little more than a specter, a fleeting shadow that vanishes upon closer inspection.\n\nFor in truth, the bond between two individuals, regardless of their orientation, is a sacred thing - a union of love and commitment that defies the petty boundaries of societal expectations. And yet, we find ourselves mired in a quagmire of fear and intolerance, where the very notion of two people loving one another is seen as a threat to the established order.\n\nBut what of the civil rights that accompany marriage? The rights to property, to inheritance, to healthcare, and to the companionship of one's partner in times of sickness and in health? These are not privileges reserved for the dominant culture, but rather, they are fundamental rights that should be afforded to all. And yet, we find that in our society, the mere presence of a partner's loved one is not enough to grant them the right to sit by their side in the hospital, to make medical decisions on their behalf, or to claim their inheritance.\n\nThe science is clear: gay couples are not somehow less capable of forming lasting, loving relationships than their heterosexual counterparts. In fact, studies have shown that the factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction are the same for all couples, regardless of orientation.\n\nBut still, we find ourselves mired in a sea of ignorance, where the notion of marriage is tied to the whims of the church, rather than the law. Where the state is seen as a bastion of morality, rather than a protector of individual rights. And it is here that we find our greatest failing - the failure to recognize that the government's role is not to impose its will, but to protect the rights of all its citizens.\n\nThe echoes of segregation and inequality still linger in our collective consciousness, a reminder of the dark chapters of our past. And yet, we continue to perpetuate a system that denies the rights of a marginalized group, simply because of their orientation. It is a moral failing of the highest order, one that we can no longer afford to ignore.\n\nAs for the concerns about children and adoption, let us not be swayed by the whispers of fear and doubt. The studies are clear: children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted, just as happy, and just as successful as those raised by heterosexual parents. And as for the argument that children will be influenced by their parents' orientation, let us not forget that it is the love and commitment of the parents that shapes their children, not their orientation.\n\nAnd so, I stand in opposition to the amendment that seeks to ban gay marriage. I stand in opposition to the notion that the government should impose its will on a group of citizens, simply because of their orientation. I stand in opposition to the ignorance and intolerance that has been masquerading as morality, and I stand in support of the fundamental human right to love and to be loved, regardless of one's orientation.",
            "The hospital pharmacy where I toil carries a weight of contradiction. On one hand, the strictures of the law dictate what we dispense, and yet, we find ourselves bound to the efficacy of those very substances we are told to repress. The notion that a thing's legality should dictate its utility is a notion I find hard to swallow. Take, for instance, the controlled substances we utilize with frequency: oxycodone, Vicodin, and Perocets. These medicines, though proscribed, hold within them the power to heal, to soothe the afflicted. And yet, we are told that another substance, one derived from the earth, holds no such virtue.\n\nThere exists a peculiar taboo surrounding this particular plant, one that seems to defy the logic of our actions. We permit the sale of substances that can lead to dependence and despair, and yet, we revile one that has been shown to bring solace. The argument that marijuana, if accessible, would be abused is a tired one. We have seen, time and time again, that the criminalization of a substance only serves to drive its allure, to create a mystique that surrounds it like a shroud.\n\nI propose a different path. One that acknowledges the plant's potential, its medicinal properties, and its capacity to bring comfort. By slowly dismantling the stigma attached to marijuana, we might foster a culture of responsible use. It is not a panacea, nor is it a replacement for the hard work of reforming the way we think about addiction. But it is a step forward, one that recognizes the complexity of the issue, and the need for a more nuanced approach.\n\nThe image of marijuana, that distorted caricature of a substance, must be dispelled. We must see it for what it is: a tool, a means to an end, a plant with the power to heal. And when we do, perhaps we will begin to see the world in a different light, one where the lines between good and evil are not so neatly drawn. Perhaps then we will be able to approach the issue of addiction with a sense of nuance, of compassion, and of understanding.",
            "The church, a bastion of tradition and ritual, has slowly begun to yield to the creeping tendrils of modernity. Gone are the days of starched collars and somber demeanor. Sundays now see the faithful, young and old, in attire ranging from the saccharine to the slovenly. The morning masses, once a time for pomp and circumstance, have been reduced to a mere thirty minutes, a hurried affair in which the devout can be seen in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the Sunday finery of yore.\n\nI recall my own childhood, spent within the hallowed halls of a private school, where Sundays were a time for communal worship and socializing with friends. The ritual of dressing up, a tradition passed down through generations, was an integral part of the experience. But now, the younger generation has brought about a change, one that I both welcome and bemoan. The air of informality is a far cry from the reverent atmosphere I once knew.\n\nAs for the allegations of pedophilia within the church, I believe it is a canker that cannot be excised by simple reforms. The notion that allowing female priests or married clergy would have prevented these atrocities is a naive one. The root of the problem lies not in the institution, but in the individual. Men, married or unmarried, can still harbor the darkness that drives them to such unspeakable acts. I think it is a matter of genetics, a tangled web of predisposition and inclination that cannot be easily unraveled. The church, in its attempts to reckon with this scourge, must not be held accountable for the failings of its members.\n\nIt is a cruel irony that some argue the church's strictures against marriage and family are to blame for the very sins that plague it. But I would counter that the reverend on Seventh Heaven, a man of faith and family, is a testament to the fact that there are those who can balance their spirituality with the demands of the flesh. If the church's teachings are to be taken seriously, then perhaps it is not the institution that requires reform, but the hearts of those who would seek to do harm.\n\nIn the end, it is not the church that needs to change, but the men who would seek to exploit its sacred trust. If the church knew of these atrocities and chose to conceal them, then shame on them indeed. But I fear that is not the case in all instances. The darkness that afflicts us is a complex and multifaceted thing, and no single solution can hope to excise it.",
            "The pall of unease still clung to the nation like a shroud in the aftermath of those fateful days in September. The Bush administration's eagerness to invade Iraq was a pretext, a thin veil of justification born of fear and anger. They wove a tapestry of lies, intertwining the specter of Osama Bin Laden with Saddam Hussein, claiming the latter possessed the very WMDs that would justify their actions. But the cloth was soon to unravel, leaving behind a trail of deceit and a people's trust shattered.\n\nThe administration's disregard for truth was palpable, a stench that clung to their very being. Colin Powell's subsequent confession, a mea culpa of sorts, only served to underscore the depths of their malfeasance. To lie to the American people is a transgression of the highest order, an impeachable offense that seared the nation's conscience.\n\nTheir disregard for the constitution was a symptom of a deeper rot, a cancer that had taken root since the events of September 11th. The younger Bush, driven by a thirst for vengeance, had set his sights on Saddam Hussein, a vendetta born of his father's unfinished business. The true intent, however, was to secure the region's energy resources, a prize to be taken by any means necessary.\n\nThe war had dragged on, a festering wound that refused to heal. Withdrawal was a prospect fraught with peril, the country teetering on the brink of civil war. The alternative, a coalition of regional powers, held its own dangers, threatening the very sovereignty of Iraq. The interim government, a fragile edifice, teetered on the edge of collapse, its parliament a mere shadow of a representative body. The forces of radicalism continued to vie for power, their influence a corrosive force that threatened to consume the nation whole.\n\nThe Prime Minister's grasp on power was tenuous at best, his authority undermined by the very factions he sought to control. The party of Muktada al-Sadr, a force to be reckoned with, held sway in the parliament, their influence a potent reminder of the country's fractured politics. The very fabric of the nation was strained to the breaking point, a delicate balance of power that threatened to shatter at any moment.\n\nIn the face of such turmoil, the nation's voice was reduced to a whispered caution, a hesitant admission that the Iraq war had become a quagmire, a quagmire of deceit and bloodshed that refused to be escaped.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a conversation, a candid voice hesitates, lost in the labyrinth of its own uncertainty. It stammers, as if the very weight of the question crushes it. \"War in Iraq...it's a thing that's hard to grasp,\" it begins, like a man lost in a desert with no map.\n\n\"We never declared it, not like we're supposed to,\" the voice continues, the words tumbling forth like a confession. \"It's a war without a name, a war without a purpose. We went in to get back at them, to avenge the wounds of 9/11. But that's not how it worked out.\" The voice trails off, like a dying ember.\n\nIn the silence, the weight of the world settles, a crushing burden that threatens to consume. \"We're building democracy, but it's a long way to go, and the cost is high. We're stuck, like a bird caught in a thorn bush. We can't leave, or they'll turn on us, and we'll be the ones to blame. But if we stay, we're just making things worse. We're trying to mold them in our image, to make them into something they're not.\"\n\nThe voice pauses, like a man lost in thought. \"I don't know what to say. I don't know what's right. But I do know that it's hard to see the families, the ones who've lost loved ones, the ones who've been torn apart by this war. They're not just statistics, they're people, with lives and hopes and dreams.\" The voice cracks, like a branch breaking under the weight of the wind.\n\n\"But then again, there's the culture, the way they live, the way they think. We're trying to change them, to make them into something we can understand. But we're only making things worse. We're fueling the fire that's burning within them, the hatred that's been festering for so long. The Al-Kaida, the dictatorship, it's all just a symptom of a deeper rot. And we're the ones who're spreading the disease.\"\n\nThe voice fades, like a whisper in the wind. \"It's a mess, a tangled web of contradictions and half-truths. I don't know what's right, but I do know that it's hard to keep going on like this. We're stuck in a cycle of violence, of retaliation, of hate. And it's hard to see a way out, a way to break free from this cycle of pain.\"\n\nThe voice trails off, lost in the silence, a small, fragile thing in a world that's too big, too loud, too cruel.",
            "The notion of the state imposing its will upon the sacred is an affront to the very fabric of our constitution.

And yet, it seems to me that this fundamental principle is being willfully ignored in the push for a constitutional amendment to codify a particular worldview.\n\nThe constitution is replete with warnings against the conflation of church and state. To suggest that it is the duty of the government to dictate the mores of the faithful is to invite a tyranny of the majority, where the whims of the powerful are imposed upon the weak. The assertion that this amendment would somehow preserve the integrity of our institutions is a hollow one, for it would merely serve to entrench the privilege of one faith over others.\n\nIt is the churches, not the state, that should be entrusted with the power to guide the faithful. The constitution's declaration of separation was not a mere suggestion, but a clarion call to safeguard the rights of all, regardless of creed. To ignore this imperative is to court disaster, and to invite the very chaos that we seek to prevent.\n\nThe motivations behind this amendment are suspect, driven as they are by personal conviction rather than a genuine concern for the common good. The notion that the government should impose its will upon the people in this matter is a recipe for disaster, a surefire path to the very kind of intolerance that our constitution was designed to prevent.\n\nIn the end, it is not the government that should be involved in this matter, but the churches themselves. For it is they who possess the authority to guide the faithful, not the state. And as for the argument that this amendment would somehow boost the economy or improve society, I remain unconvinced. The only certain outcome is that it would erode the very foundations of our democracy, and plunge us into a darkness from which we may never recover.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict that has left an indelible mark on the sands of time. It was a war born of deceit, its inception shrouded in a veil of half-truths and manipulated emotions. The American people were led to believe that the invasion was a necessary response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, a twisted narrative that blurred the lines between cause and effect. But the truth, much like the desert sands, shifted and swirled, revealing the stark reality of a war driven by ulterior motives.\n\nA war, much like the one that scarred the Vietnamese landscape, a war that was waged on foreign soil with little regard for the local populace. The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a cautionary tale of a conflict that had left a nation in ruins, its people embroiled in a cycle of violence and despair. And yet, like the cursed soldiers of the past, the American government marched forward, blinded by a hubris that would lead them down a path of destruction.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's regime was but a ruse, a thinly veiled attempt to assert American dominance over the region. The aftermath, a void of power, a maelstrom of chaos, was met with an unpreparedness that was as staggering as it was predictable. The Iraqi people, like the Vietnamese before them, were left to pick up the pieces, their lives forever changed by the ravages of war.\n\nThe notion of democracy, that sacred institution, was peddled as a panacea, a cure-all for the ills of the region. But the reality was far more complex, a delicate dance of power and politics, of competing interests and hidden agendas. The American government, with its vaunted ideals, was shown to be woefully unprepared for the task at hand, its arrogance and complacency leading to a quagmire that would prove impossible to extricate.\n\nThe toll of war, the lives lost, the families torn apart, the innocent caught in the crossfire – all these and more weighed heavily on the conscience of the American people. And yet, like the Sisyphean task that it was, the war raged on, fueled by a mix of posturing and politics, of oil and interest. The question that lingered, like a specter, was why Iraq, and not others? The answer, as with so many things, lay in the realm of the profane, the pursuit of power and control.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a conflict that will be remembered for generations to come, a reminder of the devastating consequences of unchecked ambition and the hubris of those who claim to lead. As the dust settles, and the bodies are counted, one thing is clear: the true cost of war is not measured in dollars and cents, but in the very fabric of humanity itself.",
            "The matter of gay marriage weighs heavily on my mind. It is a question of fundamental humanity, one that I have long held dear. The notion that the union of two individuals should be circumscribed by societal norms and arbitrary decrees is an affront to the very essence of freedom. The trend of scientific inquiry has, in recent years, shed light upon the biological underpinnings of desire, rendering the notion of inherent predilection increasingly difficult to ignore. It is a truth that cannot be dismissed, a truth that speaks to the inherent nature of the human experience.\n\nThe attempt to impose a singular definition upon marriage, a definition predicated upon the whims of a select few, is a travesty. It is a breach of the trust that underlies our most fundamental relationships. In the quiet streets of my hometown, where families in all their forms coexist in harmony, it is a spectacle that plays out with such tragic regularity: love unacknowledged, vulnerability unspoken. The notion that the state should intrude upon this most intimate of unions, to dictate the terms of devotion, is a grotesque affront to the human condition.\n\nThe notion that biology and environment are inextricably linked is a truth that has been borne out by the evidence. The idea that an individual's predilection is a product of chance, rather than some arbitrary decree, is a notion that resonates deeply. The fact that our society continues to cling to a notion of marriage that is at once archaic and unyielding is a testament to our collective myopia.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of human experience, marriage is a thread that weaves together the very fabric of our existence. It is a sacrament, a bond that transcends the mundane and speaks to the eternal. To reduce it to a mere political football, a pawn in the grand game of power, is a travesty. The notion that two individuals, their love and commitment unwavering, should be reduced to a spectacle, a sideshow for the consumption of the masses, is a cruelty of the highest order.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, when the din of the world recedes, it is clear: the matter of gay marriage is a question of basic human decency. It is a question of justice, of equality, of the unyielding commitment to the inherent worth of every individual. It is a question that must be answered with conviction, with compassion, and with a deep and abiding respect for the human spirit.",
            "The void of the internet stretches out before us, a chasm of the unknown where words and thoughts are stripped bare of their context, left to be devoured by an insatiable hunger. When we cast our words into this digital expanse, we surrender them to the whims of the world. The forum of the internet is a place where the publicly unspoken becomes the quietly whispered, where the jest is oft misinterpreted, and the seriousness of intent is lost in the labyrinthine corridors of the digital realm.\n\nAs an RA, I've witnessed firsthand the crushing weight of words unleashed upon the world. The ease with which a careless remark can set aflame the embers of concern, the way a hastily posted thought can ignite a maelstrom of unease, is a sobering reminder of the perils that lurk within the click of a button. The concrete halls of our school, once a bastion of learning and growth, become a tinderbox of anxiety when the words of the internet are brought to bear.\n\nIn the absence of a clear distinction between jest and earnest, we're left to navigate the treacherous waters of interpretation. Can we truly know what to take seriously, or are we forever bound to the whims of the individual, their words and actions reduced to a complex web of nuance and misinterpretation? The experiment gone awry, the sociology class that devolves into chaos, the innocent prank that takes on a life of its own – these are the cautionary tales that whisper through the digital void, a reminder that our words are never truly our own.\n\nWhen a threat is brought to the attention of the school officials, the lines between invasion of privacy and vigilance are blurred. The friend who looks through the digital footprints of another, seeking to uncover the intent behind the words, is caught in a bind of conflicting desires – to protect and to intrude. The officials, bound by duty to act, must navigate this treacherous landscape, ever mindful of the fine line between prudence and overreach.\n\nA too-curious eye, a too-knowing gaze, can be a heavy burden to bear. The teacher who takes on a pseudonym, the RA who befriends their residents – these are the trespassers in the digital wilderness, their intentions opaque, their motives unclear. And so we must be cautious, lest we forget that the words we cast into the void are forever lost to us, their meaning twisted and distorted by the unforgiving light of the digital age.",
            "The war has been drawn out, its purpose lost in the haze of time like a dying ember consumed by the winds of circumstance. What began as a noble endeavor to restore the fragile flame of democracy in a land long shrouded in tyranny has given way to a desultory campaign, a war of attrition fought for its own sake. The original impulse, to free a people from the shackles of oppression, has been supplanted by a more cynical calculus, a desire to prove the mettle of our own power.\n\nThe motivations behind the war, already suspect from the outset, were tainted by the lingering enmity between our leaders and the dictator we sought to unseat. The father's vendetta, a wound that would not heal, left its mark on the proceedings, casting a long shadow over the justifications for our intervention.\n\nWe achieved our initial goal in the early days of the conflict, a clarion call to the world that we would not stand idly by in the face of tyranny. But the war, like a festering wound, has refused to heal. It has dragged on, a Sisyphean task, with no end in sight. The original purpose, now a distant memory, has given way to a more pedestrian concern: the need to prove our dominance, to demonstrate our military might to a world grown weary of our presence.\n\nWe pour billions of dollars into this endless conflict, a hemorrhage of resources that would be better spent on the pressing needs of our own people. The wars within our own borders, the struggles of poverty and inequality, cry out for attention, but our leaders, blinded by their own ambition, turn a deaf ear. The cost of war, measured in lives and treasure, is a heavy toll to pay for a cause that has long since been lost.\n\nIn the end, it is not the enemy that threatens our very way of life, but our own hubris, our refusal to acknowledge the futility of our endeavor. We are prisoners of our own making, trapped in a war that has outlived its purpose, a war that has become a self-perpetuating machine, driven by its own momentum. It is time to stop, to acknowledge the futility of our efforts and to redirect our resources towards the pressing needs of our own people. For in the end, it is not the enemy that we must defeat, but our own shortsightedness, our willingness to sacrifice our own well-being on the altar of power and prestige.",
            "The notion of someone stumbling upon a profile, a digital footprint, and thereby preventing a life from being lost, raises questions about the delicate balance between surveillance and the anonymity of the internet. It is a truth we must confront: in the vast expanse of cyberspace, our most intimate secrets are laid bare for the world to see. On platforms like Myspace, where one's profile is but a threshold to a world of personal information, we are forced to confront the reality that our private lives are but a fleeting notion. To post one's thoughts, one's desires, one's deepest fears, is to invite the gaze of the unknown.\n\nThe scenario presented is a stark reminder of the perils of the digital age. Can we truly say that our online interactions are private when the boundaries between public and private are increasingly blurred? The notion that one must consent to share their profile with another, only to have that very act be a tacit invitation to scrutiny, is a curious one. We are drawn into a world where the notion of permission is but a distant memory.\n\nIt is a double-edged sword: on one hand, the internet offers us a means to connect with others, to share our thoughts and experiences with a world at large. On the other, it exposes us to the cold calculations of those who would seek to exploit our vulnerabilities. The idea of having a person dedicated to monitoring the online activities of students, searching for signs of malfeasance, raises the specter of a surveillance state. Is this not a form of discrimination, where the notion of innocence is but a distant memory?\n\nThe case of the high school that banned Myspace raises further questions about the limits of authority. Can a school dictate what its students may and may not do in their private lives, even when those efforts are made in the name of safety? The line between protection and intrusion is a fine one, and it is a line that we must tread with care.\n\nIn the end, the internet is a double-edged sword. It allows us to connect, to share, and to learn, but it also exposes us to the darker aspects of human nature. As we navigate this vast and ever-changing landscape, we must be aware of the perils that lurk within.",
            "The Iraq War.  A maelstrom of blood and ash that stains the pages of history, a calamity that refuses to be contained.  I find myself drawn into the morass, a reluctant voice joining the chorus of dissent.  To speak out against it now, to claim the mantle of foresight, seems a hollow exercise, a retrospective virtue that rings hollow in the face of hindsight.  Yet, it is precisely this kind of cowardice that has led us down the path of devastation, the craven reluctance to acknowledge the futility of our endeavors.\n\nThe numbers tell the tale: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, a vast and unbridgeable gulf between our ideals and their realities.  The Iraqi people, those we sought to liberate, now call for our departure, their voices a defiant whisper in the face of our hubris.  Even among our own troops, the dissent grows, a creeping sense of disillusionment that threatens to consume us all.\n\nWe speak of democracy, of bringing light to a benighted land, but it is a fiction, a cruel joke played upon the people of the Middle East.  We mistake our own values for universals, our own culture for the one true way.  The chasm between our world and theirs is a yawning abyss, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the most well-intentioned of efforts.\n\nSaddam was a tyrant, to be sure, but was he not also a symptom of a far deeper malaise?  A cancer that we have chosen to ignore, to pretend that we can excise with a scalpel, rather than confront the rot that lies at the heart of our own assumptions.\n\nWe are lost in this quagmire, our every move met with failure, our every intention thwarted by the very people we sought to help.  The statistics scream out at us: eighty percent of Iraqis desire our departure, a quarter calling for our immediate withdrawal.  And yet, we cling to our folly, blind to the fact that we are not the saviors we pretend to be.\n\nPerhaps it is time to listen to the voices of those we have sought to save.  Perhaps it is time to admit that our presence is a hindrance, a stumbling block to the very progress we claim to seek.  We may never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we can strive to be something less than the villains we have become.",
            "The specter of gender discrimination haunts the American landscape like a specter, its presence felt in the very marrow of our society. It is a grievous wound that refuses to heal, a scar that festers with each passing day. It is not a problem of men versus women alone, but a complex interplay of roles and expectations that have been etched into the psyche of our collective consciousness.\n\nIn the workplace, the glass ceiling still looms large, a constant reminder that equality remains an elusive dream. Women, in particular, find themselves trapped in a labyrinth of societal expectations, where their abilities are often dismissed in favor of the familiar and the tried. The boardroom, once a bastion of masculine power, slowly yields to the steady march of progress, as women rise through the ranks, their competence and leadership undeniable.\n\nAnd yet, the same forces that propel women forward also hold them back. In industries where fashion and style reign supreme, men are often judged on their appearance, their very masculinity called into question if they dare to venture into a traditionally female domain. The expectation that men should be breadwinners, providers, and protectors weighs heavy on those who choose to defy convention, to stay at home and nurture their families. The world looks down upon them, viewing their decision as a betrayal of their masculinity.\n\nBut this is not a one-way street. Discrimination cuts both ways, its blade slicing through the social fabric with equal ferocity. A man from a humble background, with a grammar that may not be polished, yet a mind that is sharp as a razor, may find himself shunned by his peers, his words dismissed as those of a simpleton. The prejudices of birth and upbringing can be as insidious as those of gender, and just as crippling.\n\nChange is a slow and painful process, one that requires patience and persistence. It is a battle fought on multiple fronts, with progress often measured in inches rather than miles. And yet, it is a battle worth waging, for it is only by acknowledging and confronting these deep-seated biases that we may begin to heal the wounds of the past and forge a more just and equitable future. In this, we must promote the qualities that make us human, rather than trying to force a revolution that will only meet with resistance. It is a delicate balance, one that requires us to walk the tightrope of progress, ever mindful of the fine line between progress and backlash.",
            "The understanding I have of the matter is that it was not fully legalized, but rather decriminalized. This change in the law, I gather, reduced the severity of the offense, reclassifying it as more akin to a traffic infraction – a citation, rather than an arrest and the subsequent entanglements that come with it. The fear of prosecution and the accompanying repercussions, such as difficulties in securing employment or navigating job interviews, still linger, even after decriminalization. \n\nHowever, there exists a pragmatic argument that challenges the former approach. The cost of policing, prosecution, and incarceration is substantial, and one that many municipalities, struggling financially, cannot afford. The process, from arrest to trial, incurs significant expenses: the cost of booking, housing, and appointing public defenders, not to mention the expenditure on the judicial system and state attorneys. \n\nIn places where there is a strong philosophical aversion to this course of action, despite the potential financial benefits that could be redirected towards more pressing concerns – public education, social programs for the elderly, or food assistance for the homeless – the status quo persists. In contrast, cities with a more liberal bent, like Denver, have moved to decriminalize, potentially freeing up resources for more critical needs.\n\nThe issue, however, is not simply a matter of economics or personal freedoms. There are legitimate concerns regarding the proliferation of marijuana, should it become fully legalized. The fear of widespread use, particularly among drivers, remains a valid worry, given its lingering taboo status in many contexts. Moreover, the impact of marijuana on lifestyle choices, as opposed to merely motor skills, cannot be ignored. While both substances carry risks, individuals' responses to them vary greatly, influenced by their unique personalities and capacity for moderation.\n\nUltimately, the complexities of this issue highlight the difficulty in generalizing about the effects of substances. Each person reacts differently, and it is essential to consider this variability when evaluating the merits of decriminalization.",
            "In truth, I find myself drawn to the traditions of the Catholic faith, those timeless practices that have endured for generations, a testament to the indomitable will of those who have come before us. Yet, I am also aware of the dangers of stagnation, of a dogma that refuses to yield to the whispers of a changing world. The rigidity of the Church's stance on certain matters weighs heavily upon me, a tension that can only be resolved by embracing the virtues of compassion and acceptance.\n\nA devout soul, I have seen the weight of doctrine bear down upon those who do not conform, the judgmental gaze of an institution that fails to live up to its own teachings. The memory of my parents' struggles, a union blessed by the Episcopal faith yet rejected by the very Church they sought to join, still lingers, a painful reminder of the schism that can arise when tradition is allowed to supplant love.\n\nAnd so, I find myself questioning the wisdom of a Church that espouses the virtue of love while condemning those who do not meet its narrow standards. It is a hypocrisy that seems to run deep, a refusal to adapt to the world as it is, rather than as it once was. The teachings of the Church, meant to guide us towards a higher truth, often seem to serve only as a means of separation, a barrier that keeps us apart from one another rather than drawing us together in love.\n\nAs for the issue of priests and marriage, I am torn. On one hand, I see the potential benefits of a more inclusive approach, one that might bring an end to the isolation that can breed such darkness. And yet, I fear that the roots of such depravity run too deep, that the act of marriage would not be enough to stem the tide of evil. The bond between a man and child is a different thing altogether, one that cannot be severed by the simple act of matrimony. In the end, it is a problem that cannot be solved by changing the rules, but only by confronting the darkness that lies within.",
            "The line between the sacred and the profane, it is a thin one indeed.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this issue, unable to discern the right path from the wrong.  The confluence of church and state, a chasm that yawns open like an abyss, threatening to consume us all.  The very notion of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil contract to others, is a puzzle that defies solution.\n\nTo define it, to legislate it, to impose one's will upon it, is to risk offending the very fabric of our society.  And yet, we are drawn to it, like moths to a flame, our passions and prejudices aflame.  The civil union, a word that trips off the tongue with ease, yet holds within it the weight of centuries of tradition and expectation.\n\nI am torn, a leaf blown by the winds of doubt.  Should we not see marriage for what it is?  A union of two people, bound together by love and commitment?  Why must we complicate it, with the weight of dogma and the stain of fanaticism?  Is it not enough to acknowledge the fundamental truth of two people, joined in their quest for happiness and companionship?\n\nBut then, there is the matter of the states, each one a sovereign entity, a miniature universe unto itself.  Can we not find a way to reconcile our differences, to arrive at a logical conclusion?  Or are we doomed to stumble forward, like blind men in a darkened room, our hands outstretched, seeking the wall?\n\nA constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, a step taken in haste, without thought or reflection.  Is the issue of gay marriage so grave, so calamitous, that it warrants such drastic action?  I think not.  It is but a symptom, a symptom of a greater disease, a disease of intolerance and misunderstanding.\n\nNo, let us not amend the constitution, let us not alter the very fabric of our society, to accommodate the whims of a select few.  Let us instead, seek the path of wisdom, the path of compassion, the path of understanding.  For it is in the recognition of our shared humanity, that we find the strength to overcome our differences, and to forge a new way forward, a way that is just, and equitable, and true.",
            "In the shadow of a faith that has long been a fixture in my life, I find myself drawn into the twilight of uncertainty, where the certainties of morality are tested by the whispered truths of the heart. The question of homosexuality, a labyrinthine puzzle that has torn asunder the threads of our collective conscience, is one that I grapple with in solitude. I have walked among those who have lived a life outside the bounds of societal norms, their presence a gentle reminder that the boundaries we draw are but a thin line in the vast expanse of humanity.\n\nAnd yet, I find myself at odds with their choices, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, a tempest that rages against the tide of my upbringing. But in the stillness of the night, a clarity arises – that the choices we make are ours to make, and ours alone. The weight of the nation's moral compass, heavy as it may be, should not be the sole arbiter of our moral code.\n\nIn a land of disparate states, each a microcosm of the nation's diverse tapestry, the question of gay marriage becomes a matter of local conscience. Whether the fabric of our society is woven from the threads of tradition or the needle of progress, the choice to marry or not to marry should be left to the discretion of each state. For in the end, it is not the president who will bear the weight of our decisions, but we, the individuals, who will live with them.\n\nI do not pretend to be a seer, but I do see a truth – that the threads of our lives are interwoven, and that the choices we make are not without consequence. The president's role is not to dictate the course of our lives, but to guide us towards a broader vision. And so, I believe that the decision to legalize or not to legalize gay marriage should be left to the states, each a small, burning flame that casts its light upon the darkness.\n\nThe ebb and flow of history, a tide that has seen the rise and fall of empires, will ultimately decide the fate of our nation's moral fabric. And so, I do not covet the power of the president, nor do I believe that his will should be the sole determining factor in our lives. For in the end, it is not he who will live with the consequences of our choices, but we, the individuals, who will bear the weight of our decisions.",
            "The notion that Myspace, a public forum, should be exempt from scrutiny is a notion born of naivety.  In this age, where the lines between private and public have grown increasingly blurred, the expectation of anonymity is a fool's errand.  When one posts on such a platform, they consign their words to the wind, where they can be swept up by an unseen hand.\n\nSchool officials, like any other entity, have the right to surveil the digital landscape, for in it lies the potential for threats to the safety of their domain.  Even if a student's Myspace profile is not explicitly labeled with their school affiliation, the information contained within can still be accessed, its digital footprint tracing back to the school's jurisdiction.  The officials' actions, then, are not an invasion of privacy, but a necessary measure to safeguard the well-being of their students.\n\nLike a sentinel watching for signs of danger, the school officials patrol the digital realm, ever vigilant for indications of potential threats.  And if, in their pursuit, they stumble upon incriminating evidence, it is not an overreach of authority, but a fulfillment of their duty to ensure the safety of their charges.  The argument that they are \"just\" looking for students to get in trouble is a red herring, a distraction from the true purpose at hand: to protect the students from harm.\n\nThe consequences of action, or inaction, are stark.  A single misplaced word, a careless comment, can come back to haunt, its digital echo lingering long after the original iteration has faded into memory.  The notion that one can escape the consequences of their online actions is a myth, a comforting fantasy that offers little solace in the face of the unforgiving digital landscape.\n\nIn the aftermath of Columbine, and the countless other tragedies that have befallen our schools, it is clear that the stakes are high, and the need for vigilance is paramount.  School officials, in their efforts to prevent such calamities, are not overstepping their bounds, but fulfilling their duty to their students, their community, and themselves.",
            "In the aftermath of the calamity that befell us on that fateful day, a maelstrom of emotions churned within me, propelling me headlong into the abyss of war. It was a tempest of vengeance, a torrent of righteous fury that threatened to consume all in its path. But in the cold light of dawn, as the fires of passion died down, I came to realize that our actions were as reckless as they were unconsidered. The void that yawned before us was as dark as it was unforgiving, and we charged in with the unyielding zeal of the ignorant.\n\nWe marched into the heart of chaos, blind to the perils that lay before us, our footsteps echoing through the desolate landscape like the death knell of reason. The land was a labyrinth of ancient hatreds, where the very air was heavy with the weight of a thousand midnights, and we thought to impose our will upon it as if it were a tabula rasa. But the people we sought to transform were as intractable as the earth itself, their hearts as hard as the stones that scarred their hills.\n\nOur presence was a catalyst for the very discord we sought to abate, a spark that ignited a fire that would soon consume us all. We were the strangers in a strange land, our intentions as opaque as the desert skies, and our actions as violent as the sandstorms that ravaged the dunes. We were the agents of a foreign power, our words as hollow as the promises we made to their people, and our actions as cruel as the whims of a merciless deity.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy we had sought to vanquish, but our own hubris. We had embarked upon a crusade of folly, driven by the passions of the moment, rather than the cold calculus of reason. And now, as we withdraw from the devastation we created, we are left to confront the ruins of our own making. The people we sought to liberate remain as entrenched in their ways as ever, their hearts as hardened as the earth we sought to reshape.\n\nWe came to Iraq with the arrogance of the untested, and we leave with the scars of the wounded. Our presence was a fleeting moment in the annals of time, a brief, shining instant of hubris that has given way to the crushing weight of reality. And in the end, it is not the enemy we have defeated, but our own illusions of invincibility."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

The sacrament of marriage, the sanctity of life, the prohibition on birth control – these are the touchstones around which the faithful are tested, and those who falter are cast aside.\n\nThe weight of tradition bears down upon the Church, an anachronistic relic of a bygone era. Its views on the matters of the heart – love, fertility, and mortality – seem antiquated and inhospitable. The world has moved on, and the Church's refusal to adapt has made it an anathema to those who would seek solace in its teachings.\n\nThe silent majority, those who would rather not be bound by the strictures of the Church's doctrine, are increasingly disillusioned. They see in the Church's stance on abortion, on gay marriage, and on the role of women in the clergy, a rigidity that is at odds with the compassion and understanding that they seek in their faith. They are not comforted by the Church's certainties, but rather repelled by its inflexibility.\n\nThe issue of clerical marriage, too, raises its head. Why, in an age where even the most devoted of professionals are permitted to balance their duties with their personal lives, should priests be denied this simple humanity? Is it not true that a life of devotion to God can coexist with a life of devotion to one's family and community? The Church's answer, that the priest is married to God, rings hollow in the ears of those who would see in the clergy a reflection of the human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the teachings of the Church that are at issue, but its unwillingness to evolve. The world is a complex and multifaceted place, and the Church's refusal to engage with its intricacies has made it a relic of a bygone era. It is time for the Church to adapt, to find a new language that speaks to the hearts of those who would follow it. Anything less would be a betrayal of the very spirit of faith that it seeks to uphold.",
            "The vacillations of the mind, a maelstrom of uncertainty.  One's stance on the matter of gay marriage falters, a hesitant and halting thing.  Yet, a conviction forms, a refusal to acquiesce to the notion that one's nature is a choice.  The born and the made, a distinction that blurs with each passing moment.  Can the human heart truly choose its desires, its inclinations?  Or is it a force beyond our control, a primal urge that cannot be stilled?\n\nThe world judges, and in its judgment, it seeks to condemn.  But what right has it to do so?  Is it not enough to simply exist, to be?  The federal government, a behemoth of power, seeking to impose its will upon the private lives of its citizens.  But what concern is it of theirs?  Is it not enough to leave well enough alone, to permit the individual to chart its own course?\n\nThe weight of societal expectation, a crushing force that seeks to suffocate the soul.  And yet, in the face of this oppression, the human spirit finds a way to persevere.  To be who one is, to love who one loves, to live in the world as one sees fit.  And it is not for others to dictate, to judge, or to condemn.  For in the end, it is not for us to say what is right or wrong, but rather to live in accordance with our own hearts.\n\nIn the silence of the night, one's doubts and fears are laid bare.  But even in the face of uncertainty, a clarity forms, a conviction that cannot be shaken.  The federal government's intrusion into the private lives of its citizens is an affront to the very notion of liberty.  A liberty that is not given, but rather taken, a freedom to live as one sees fit.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of right or wrong, but of the human condition.  A condition that is messy, complex, and multifaceted.  And it is in this complexity that we find our true selves, our true humanity.  So let us not judge, but rather seek to understand.  For in understanding, we may find a glimmer of compassion, a spark of empathy that sets us free.",
            "In the grand tapestry of human existence, there exists a thread of discord - the debate over gay marriage. It is a subject that has long been mired in the muck of misconception and the murk of moral ambiguity. Many a voice has risen to oppose the union, citing the notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family. But such a notion is little more than a specter, a fleeting shadow that vanishes upon closer inspection.\n\nFor in truth, the bond between two individuals, regardless of their orientation, is a sacred thing - a union of love and commitment that defies the petty boundaries of societal expectations. And yet, we find ourselves mired in a quagmire of fear and intolerance, where the very notion of two people loving one another is seen as a threat to the established order.\n\nBut what of the civil rights that accompany marriage? The rights to property, to inheritance, to healthcare, and to the companionship of one's partner in times of sickness and in health? These are not privileges reserved for the dominant culture, but rather, they are fundamental rights that should be afforded to all. And yet, we find that in our society, the mere presence of a partner's loved one is not enough to grant them the right to sit by their side in the hospital, to make medical decisions on their behalf, or to claim their inheritance.\n\nThe science is clear: gay couples are not somehow less capable of forming lasting, loving relationships than their heterosexual counterparts. In fact, studies have shown that the factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction are the same for all couples, regardless of orientation.\n\nBut still, we find ourselves mired in a sea of ignorance, where the notion of marriage is tied to the whims of the church, rather than the law. Where the state is seen as a bastion of morality, rather than a protector of individual rights. And it is here that we find our greatest failing - the failure to recognize that the government's role is not to impose its will, but to protect the rights of all its citizens.\n\nThe echoes of segregation and inequality still linger in our collective consciousness, a reminder of the dark chapters of our past. And yet, we continue to perpetuate a system that denies the rights of a marginalized group, simply because of their orientation. It is a moral failing of the highest order, one that we can no longer afford to ignore.\n\nAs for the concerns about children and adoption, let us not be swayed by the whispers of fear and doubt. The studies are clear: children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted, just as happy, and just as successful as those raised by heterosexual parents. And as for the argument that children will be influenced by their parents' orientation, let us not forget that it is the love and commitment of the parents that shapes their children, not their orientation.\n\nAnd so, I stand in opposition to the amendment that seeks to ban gay marriage. I stand in opposition to the notion that the government should impose its will on a group of citizens, simply because of their orientation. I stand in opposition to the ignorance and intolerance that has been masquerading as morality, and I stand in support of the fundamental human right to love and to be loved, regardless of one's orientation.",
            "The hospital pharmacy where I toil carries a weight of contradiction. On one hand, the strictures of the law dictate what we dispense, and yet, we find ourselves bound to the efficacy of those very substances we are told to repress. The notion that a thing's legality should dictate its utility is a notion I find hard to swallow. Take, for instance, the controlled substances we utilize with frequency: oxycodone, Vicodin, and Perocets. These medicines, though proscribed, hold within them the power to heal, to soothe the afflicted. And yet, we are told that another substance, one derived from the earth, holds no such virtue.\n\nThere exists a peculiar taboo surrounding this particular plant, one that seems to defy the logic of our actions. We permit the sale of substances that can lead to dependence and despair, and yet, we revile one that has been shown to bring solace. The argument that marijuana, if accessible, would be abused is a tired one. We have seen, time and time again, that the criminalization of a substance only serves to drive its allure, to create a mystique that surrounds it like a shroud.\n\nI propose a different path. One that acknowledges the plant's potential, its medicinal properties, and its capacity to bring comfort. By slowly dismantling the stigma attached to marijuana, we might foster a culture of responsible use. It is not a panacea, nor is it a replacement for the hard work of reforming the way we think about addiction. But it is a step forward, one that recognizes the complexity of the issue, and the need for a more nuanced approach.\n\nThe image of marijuana, that distorted caricature of a substance, must be dispelled. We must see it for what it is: a tool, a means to an end, a plant with the power to heal. And when we do, perhaps we will begin to see the world in a different light, one where the lines between good and evil are not so neatly drawn. Perhaps then we will be able to approach the issue of addiction with a sense of nuance, of compassion, and of understanding.",
            "The church, a bastion of tradition and ritual, has slowly begun to yield to the creeping tendrils of modernity. Gone are the days of starched collars and somber demeanor. Sundays now see the faithful, young and old, in attire ranging from the saccharine to the slovenly. The morning masses, once a time for pomp and circumstance, have been reduced to a mere thirty minutes, a hurried affair in which the devout can be seen in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the Sunday finery of yore.\n\nI recall my own childhood, spent within the hallowed halls of a private school, where Sundays were a time for communal worship and socializing with friends. The ritual of dressing up, a tradition passed down through generations, was an integral part of the experience. But now, the younger generation has brought about a change, one that I both welcome and bemoan. The air of informality is a far cry from the reverent atmosphere I once knew.\n\nAs for the allegations of pedophilia within the church, I believe it is a canker that cannot be excised by simple reforms. The notion that allowing female priests or married clergy would have prevented these atrocities is a naive one. The root of the problem lies not in the institution, but in the individual. Men, married or unmarried, can still harbor the darkness that drives them to such unspeakable acts. I think it is a matter of genetics, a tangled web of predisposition and inclination that cannot be easily unraveled. The church, in its attempts to reckon with this scourge, must not be held accountable for the failings of its members.\n\nIt is a cruel irony that some argue the church's strictures against marriage and family are to blame for the very sins that plague it. But I would counter that the reverend on Seventh Heaven, a man of faith and family, is a testament to the fact that there are those who can balance their spirituality with the demands of the flesh. If the church's teachings are to be taken seriously, then perhaps it is not the institution that requires reform, but the hearts of those who would seek to do harm.\n\nIn the end, it is not the church that needs to change, but the men who would seek to exploit its sacred trust. If the church knew of these atrocities and chose to conceal them, then shame on them indeed. But I fear that is not the case in all instances. The darkness that afflicts us is a complex and multifaceted thing, and no single solution can hope to excise it.",
            "The pall of unease still clung to the nation like a shroud in the aftermath of those fateful days in September. The Bush administration's eagerness to invade Iraq was a pretext, a thin veil of justification born of fear and anger. They wove a tapestry of lies, intertwining the specter of Osama Bin Laden with Saddam Hussein, claiming the latter possessed the very WMDs that would justify their actions. But the cloth was soon to unravel, leaving behind a trail of deceit and a people's trust shattered.\n\nThe administration's disregard for truth was palpable, a stench that clung to their very being. Colin Powell's subsequent confession, a mea culpa of sorts, only served to underscore the depths of their malfeasance. To lie to the American people is a transgression of the highest order, an impeachable offense that seared the nation's conscience.\n\nTheir disregard for the constitution was a symptom of a deeper rot, a cancer that had taken root since the events of September 11th. The younger Bush, driven by a thirst for vengeance, had set his sights on Saddam Hussein, a vendetta born of his father's unfinished business. The true intent, however, was to secure the region's energy resources, a prize to be taken by any means necessary.\n\nThe war had dragged on, a festering wound that refused to heal. Withdrawal was a prospect fraught with peril, the country teetering on the brink of civil war. The alternative, a coalition of regional powers, held its own dangers, threatening the very sovereignty of Iraq. The interim government, a fragile edifice, teetered on the edge of collapse, its parliament a mere shadow of a representative body. The forces of radicalism continued to vie for power, their influence a corrosive force that threatened to consume the nation whole.\n\nThe Prime Minister's grasp on power was tenuous at best, his authority undermined by the very factions he sought to control. The party of Muktada al-Sadr, a force to be reckoned with, held sway in the parliament, their influence a potent reminder of the country's fractured politics. The very fabric of the nation was strained to the breaking point, a delicate balance of power that threatened to shatter at any moment.\n\nIn the face of such turmoil, the nation's voice was reduced to a whispered caution, a hesitant admission that the Iraq war had become a quagmire, a quagmire of deceit and bloodshed that refused to be escaped.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a conversation, a candid voice hesitates, lost in the labyrinth of its own uncertainty. It stammers, as if the very weight of the question crushes it. \"War in Iraq...it's a thing that's hard to grasp,\" it begins, like a man lost in a desert with no map.\n\n\"We never declared it, not like we're supposed to,\" the voice continues, the words tumbling forth like a confession. \"It's a war without a name, a war without a purpose. We went in to get back at them, to avenge the wounds of 9/11. But that's not how it worked out.\" The voice trails off, like a dying ember.\n\nIn the silence, the weight of the world settles, a crushing burden that threatens to consume. \"We're building democracy, but it's a long way to go, and the cost is high. We're stuck, like a bird caught in a thorn bush. We can't leave, or they'll turn on us, and we'll be the ones to blame. But if we stay, we're just making things worse. We're trying to mold them in our image, to make them into something they're not.\"\n\nThe voice pauses, like a man lost in thought. \"I don't know what to say. I don't know what's right. But I do know that it's hard to see the families, the ones who've lost loved ones, the ones who've been torn apart by this war. They're not just statistics, they're people, with lives and hopes and dreams.\" The voice cracks, like a branch breaking under the weight of the wind.\n\n\"But then again, there's the culture, the way they live, the way they think. We're trying to change them, to make them into something we can understand. But we're only making things worse. We're fueling the fire that's burning within them, the hatred that's been festering for so long. The Al-Kaida, the dictatorship, it's all just a symptom of a deeper rot. And we're the ones who're spreading the disease.\"\n\nThe voice fades, like a whisper in the wind. \"It's a mess, a tangled web of contradictions and half-truths. I don't know what's right, but I do know that it's hard to keep going on like this. We're stuck in a cycle of violence, of retaliation, of hate. And it's hard to see a way out, a way to break free from this cycle of pain.\"\n\nThe voice trails off, lost in the silence, a small, fragile thing in a world that's too big, too loud, too cruel.",
            "The notion of the state imposing its will upon the sacred is an affront to the very fabric of our constitution. The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of our democracy, is designed to safeguard the freedom of the faithful from the grasp of temporal power. And yet, it seems to me that this fundamental principle is being willfully ignored in the push for a constitutional amendment to codify a particular worldview.\n\nThe constitution is replete with warnings against the conflation of church and state. To suggest that it is the duty of the government to dictate the mores of the faithful is to invite a tyranny of the majority, where the whims of the powerful are imposed upon the weak. The assertion that this amendment would somehow preserve the integrity of our institutions is a hollow one, for it would merely serve to entrench the privilege of one faith over others.\n\nIt is the churches, not the state, that should be entrusted with the power to guide the faithful. The constitution's declaration of separation was not a mere suggestion, but a clarion call to safeguard the rights of all, regardless of creed. To ignore this imperative is to court disaster, and to invite the very chaos that we seek to prevent.\n\nThe motivations behind this amendment are suspect, driven as they are by personal conviction rather than a genuine concern for the common good. The notion that the government should impose its will upon the people in this matter is a recipe for disaster, a surefire path to the very kind of intolerance that our constitution was designed to prevent.\n\nIn the end, it is not the government that should be involved in this matter, but the churches themselves. For it is they who possess the authority to guide the faithful, not the state. And as for the argument that this amendment would somehow boost the economy or improve society, I remain unconvinced. The only certain outcome is that it would erode the very foundations of our democracy, and plunge us into a darkness from which we may never recover.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict that has left an indelible mark on the sands of time. It was a war born of deceit, its inception shrouded in a veil of half-truths and manipulated emotions. The American people were led to believe that the invasion was a necessary response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, a twisted narrative that blurred the lines between cause and effect. But the truth, much like the desert sands, shifted and swirled, revealing the stark reality of a war driven by ulterior motives.\n\nA war, much like the one that scarred the Vietnamese landscape, a war that was waged on foreign soil with little regard for the local populace. The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a cautionary tale of a conflict that had left a nation in ruins, its people embroiled in a cycle of violence and despair. And yet, like the cursed soldiers of the past, the American government marched forward, blinded by a hubris that would lead them down a path of destruction.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's regime was but a ruse, a thinly veiled attempt to assert American dominance over the region. The aftermath, a void of power, a maelstrom of chaos, was met with an unpreparedness that was as staggering as it was predictable. The Iraqi people, like the Vietnamese before them, were left to pick up the pieces, their lives forever changed by the ravages of war.\n\nThe notion of democracy, that sacred institution, was peddled as a panacea, a cure-all for the ills of the region. But the reality was far more complex, a delicate dance of power and politics, of competing interests and hidden agendas. The American government, with its vaunted ideals, was shown to be woefully unprepared for the task at hand, its arrogance and complacency leading to a quagmire that would prove impossible to extricate.\n\nThe toll of war, the lives lost, the families torn apart, the innocent caught in the crossfire – all these and more weighed heavily on the conscience of the American people. And yet, like the Sisyphean task that it was, the war raged on, fueled by a mix of posturing and politics, of oil and interest. The question that lingered, like a specter, was why Iraq, and not others? The answer, as with so many things, lay in the realm of the profane, the pursuit of power and control.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a conflict that will be remembered for generations to come, a reminder of the devastating consequences of unchecked ambition and the hubris of those who claim to lead. As the dust settles, and the bodies are counted, one thing is clear: the true cost of war is not measured in dollars and cents, but in the very fabric of humanity itself.",
            "The matter of gay marriage weighs heavily on my mind. It is a question of fundamental humanity, one that I have long held dear. The notion that the union of two individuals should be circumscribed by societal norms and arbitrary decrees is an affront to the very essence of freedom. The trend of scientific inquiry has, in recent years, shed light upon the biological underpinnings of desire, rendering the notion of inherent predilection increasingly difficult to ignore. It is a truth that cannot be dismissed, a truth that speaks to the inherent nature of the human experience.\n\nThe attempt to impose a singular definition upon marriage, a definition predicated upon the whims of a select few, is a travesty. It is a breach of the trust that underlies our most fundamental relationships. In the quiet streets of my hometown, where families in all their forms coexist in harmony, it is a spectacle that plays out with such tragic regularity: love unacknowledged, vulnerability unspoken. The notion that the state should intrude upon this most intimate of unions, to dictate the terms of devotion, is a grotesque affront to the human condition.\n\nThe notion that biology and environment are inextricably linked is a truth that has been borne out by the evidence. The idea that an individual's predilection is a product of chance, rather than some arbitrary decree, is a notion that resonates deeply. The fact that our society continues to cling to a notion of marriage that is at once archaic and unyielding is a testament to our collective myopia.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of human experience, marriage is a thread that weaves together the very fabric of our existence. It is a sacrament, a bond that transcends the mundane and speaks to the eternal. To reduce it to a mere political football, a pawn in the grand game of power, is a travesty. The notion that two individuals, their love and commitment unwavering, should be reduced to a spectacle, a sideshow for the consumption of the masses, is a cruelty of the highest order.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, when the din of the world recedes, it is clear: the matter of gay marriage is a question of basic human decency. It is a question of justice, of equality, of the unyielding commitment to the inherent worth of every individual. It is a question that must be answered with conviction, with compassion, and with a deep and abiding respect for the human spirit.",
            "The void of the internet stretches out before us, a chasm of the unknown where words and thoughts are stripped bare of their context, left to be devoured by an insatiable hunger. When we cast our words into this digital expanse, we surrender them to the whims of the world. The forum of the internet is a place where the publicly unspoken becomes the quietly whispered, where the jest is oft misinterpreted, and the seriousness of intent is lost in the labyrinthine corridors of the digital realm.\n\nAs an RA, I've witnessed firsthand the crushing weight of words unleashed upon the world. The ease with which a careless remark can set aflame the embers of concern, the way a hastily posted thought can ignite a maelstrom of unease, is a sobering reminder of the perils that lurk within the click of a button. The concrete halls of our school, once a bastion of learning and growth, become a tinderbox of anxiety when the words of the internet are brought to bear.\n\nIn the absence of a clear distinction between jest and earnest, we're left to navigate the treacherous waters of interpretation. Can we truly know what to take seriously, or are we forever bound to the whims of the individual, their words and actions reduced to a complex web of nuance and misinterpretation? The experiment gone awry, the sociology class that devolves into chaos, the innocent prank that takes on a life of its own – these are the cautionary tales that whisper through the digital void, a reminder that our words are never truly our own.\n\nWhen a threat is brought to the attention of the school officials, the lines between invasion of privacy and vigilance are blurred. The friend who looks through the digital footprints of another, seeking to uncover the intent behind the words, is caught in a bind of conflicting desires – to protect and to intrude. The officials, bound by duty to act, must navigate this treacherous landscape, ever mindful of the fine line between prudence and overreach.\n\nA too-curious eye, a too-knowing gaze, can be a heavy burden to bear. The teacher who takes on a pseudonym, the RA who befriends their residents – these are the trespassers in the digital wilderness, their intentions opaque, their motives unclear. And so we must be cautious, lest we forget that the words we cast into the void are forever lost to us, their meaning twisted and distorted by the unforgiving light of the digital age.",
            "The war has been drawn out, its purpose lost in the haze of time like a dying ember consumed by the winds of circumstance. What began as a noble endeavor to restore the fragile flame of democracy in a land long shrouded in tyranny has given way to a desultory campaign, a war of attrition fought for its own sake. The original impulse, to free a people from the shackles of oppression, has been supplanted by a more cynical calculus, a desire to prove the mettle of our own power.\n\nThe motivations behind the war, already suspect from the outset, were tainted by the lingering enmity between our leaders and the dictator we sought to unseat. The father's vendetta, a wound that would not heal, left its mark on the proceedings, casting a long shadow over the justifications for our intervention.\n\nWe achieved our initial goal in the early days of the conflict, a clarion call to the world that we would not stand idly by in the face of tyranny. But the war, like a festering wound, has refused to heal. It has dragged on, a Sisyphean task, with no end in sight. The original purpose, now a distant memory, has given way to a more pedestrian concern: the need to prove our dominance, to demonstrate our military might to a world grown weary of our presence.\n\nWe pour billions of dollars into this endless conflict, a hemorrhage of resources that would be better spent on the pressing needs of our own people. The wars within our own borders, the struggles of poverty and inequality, cry out for attention, but our leaders, blinded by their own ambition, turn a deaf ear. The cost of war, measured in lives and treasure, is a heavy toll to pay for a cause that has long since been lost.\n\nIn the end, it is not the enemy that threatens our very way of life, but our own hubris, our refusal to acknowledge the futility of our endeavor. We are prisoners of our own making, trapped in a war that has outlived its purpose, a war that has become a self-perpetuating machine, driven by its own momentum. It is time to stop, to acknowledge the futility of our efforts and to redirect our resources towards the pressing needs of our own people. For in the end, it is not the enemy that we must defeat, but our own shortsightedness, our willingness to sacrifice our own well-being on the altar of power and prestige.",
            "The notion of someone stumbling upon a profile, a digital footprint, and thereby preventing a life from being lost, raises questions about the delicate balance between surveillance and the anonymity of the internet. It is a truth we must confront: in the vast expanse of cyberspace, our most intimate secrets are laid bare for the world to see. On platforms like Myspace, where one's profile is but a threshold to a world of personal information, we are forced to confront the reality that our private lives are but a fleeting notion. To post one's thoughts, one's desires, one's deepest fears, is to invite the gaze of the unknown.\n\nThe scenario presented is a stark reminder of the perils of the digital age. Can we truly say that our online interactions are private when the boundaries between public and private are increasingly blurred? The notion that one must consent to share their profile with another, only to have that very act be a tacit invitation to scrutiny, is a curious one. We are drawn into a world where the notion of permission is but a distant memory.\n\nIt is a double-edged sword: on one hand, the internet offers us a means to connect with others, to share our thoughts and experiences with a world at large. On the other, it exposes us to the cold calculations of those who would seek to exploit our vulnerabilities. The idea of having a person dedicated to monitoring the online activities of students, searching for signs of malfeasance, raises the specter of a surveillance state. Is this not a form of discrimination, where the notion of innocence is but a distant memory?\n\nThe case of the high school that banned Myspace raises further questions about the limits of authority. Can a school dictate what its students may and may not do in their private lives, even when those efforts are made in the name of safety? The line between protection and intrusion is a fine one, and it is a line that we must tread with care.\n\nIn the end, the internet is a double-edged sword. It allows us to connect, to share, and to learn, but it also exposes us to the darker aspects of human nature. As we navigate this vast and ever-changing landscape, we must be aware of the perils that lurk within.",
            "The Iraq War.  A maelstrom of blood and ash that stains the pages of history, a calamity that refuses to be contained.  I find myself drawn into the morass, a reluctant voice joining the chorus of dissent.  To speak out against it now, to claim the mantle of foresight, seems a hollow exercise, a retrospective virtue that rings hollow in the face of hindsight.  Yet, it is precisely this kind of cowardice that has led us down the path of devastation, the craven reluctance to acknowledge the futility of our endeavors.\n\nThe numbers tell the tale: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, a vast and unbridgeable gulf between our ideals and their realities.  The Iraqi people, those we sought to liberate, now call for our departure, their voices a defiant whisper in the face of our hubris.  Even among our own troops, the dissent grows, a creeping sense of disillusionment that threatens to consume us all.\n\nWe speak of democracy, of bringing light to a benighted land, but it is a fiction, a cruel joke played upon the people of the Middle East.  We mistake our own values for universals, our own culture for the one true way.  The chasm between our world and theirs is a yawning abyss, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the most well-intentioned of efforts.\n\nSaddam was a tyrant, to be sure, but was he not also a symptom of a far deeper malaise?  A cancer that we have chosen to ignore, to pretend that we can excise with a scalpel, rather than confront the rot that lies at the heart of our own assumptions.\n\nWe are lost in this quagmire, our every move met with failure, our every intention thwarted by the very people we sought to help.  The statistics scream out at us: eighty percent of Iraqis desire our departure, a quarter calling for our immediate withdrawal.

Perhaps it is time to admit that our presence is a hindrance, a stumbling block to the very progress we claim to seek.  We may never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we can strive to be something less than the villains we have become.",
            "The specter of gender discrimination haunts the American landscape like a specter, its presence felt in the very marrow of our society. It is a grievous wound that refuses to heal, a scar that festers with each passing day. It is not a problem of men versus women alone, but a complex interplay of roles and expectations that have been etched into the psyche of our collective consciousness.\n\nIn the workplace, the glass ceiling still looms large, a constant reminder that equality remains an elusive dream. Women, in particular, find themselves trapped in a labyrinth of societal expectations, where their abilities are often dismissed in favor of the familiar and the tried. The boardroom, once a bastion of masculine power, slowly yields to the steady march of progress, as women rise through the ranks, their competence and leadership undeniable.\n\nAnd yet, the same forces that propel women forward also hold them back. In industries where fashion and style reign supreme, men are often judged on their appearance, their very masculinity called into question if they dare to venture into a traditionally female domain. The expectation that men should be breadwinners, providers, and protectors weighs heavy on those who choose to defy convention, to stay at home and nurture their families. The world looks down upon them, viewing their decision as a betrayal of their masculinity.\n\nBut this is not a one-way street. Discrimination cuts both ways, its blade slicing through the social fabric with equal ferocity. A man from a humble background, with a grammar that may not be polished, yet a mind that is sharp as a razor, may find himself shunned by his peers, his words dismissed as those of a simpleton. The prejudices of birth and upbringing can be as insidious as those of gender, and just as crippling.\n\nChange is a slow and painful process, one that requires patience and persistence. It is a battle fought on multiple fronts, with progress often measured in inches rather than miles. And yet, it is a battle worth waging, for it is only by acknowledging and confronting these deep-seated biases that we may begin to heal the wounds of the past and forge a more just and equitable future. In this, we must promote the qualities that make us human, rather than trying to force a revolution that will only meet with resistance. It is a delicate balance, one that requires us to walk the tightrope of progress, ever mindful of the fine line between progress and backlash.",
            "The understanding I have of the matter is that it was not fully legalized, but rather decriminalized. This change in the law, I gather, reduced the severity of the offense, reclassifying it as more akin to a traffic infraction – a citation, rather than an arrest and the subsequent entanglements that come with it. The fear of prosecution and the accompanying repercussions, such as difficulties in securing employment or navigating job interviews, still linger, even after decriminalization. \n\nHowever, there exists a pragmatic argument that challenges the former approach. The cost of policing, prosecution, and incarceration is substantial, and one that many municipalities, struggling financially, cannot afford. The process, from arrest to trial, incurs significant expenses: the cost of booking, housing, and appointing public defenders, not to mention the expenditure on the judicial system and state attorneys. \n\nIn places where there is a strong philosophical aversion to this course of action, despite the potential financial benefits that could be redirected towards more pressing concerns – public education, social programs for the elderly, or food assistance for the homeless – the status quo persists. In contrast, cities with a more liberal bent, like Denver, have moved to decriminalize, potentially freeing up resources for more critical needs.\n\nThe issue, however, is not simply a matter of economics or personal freedoms. There are legitimate concerns regarding the proliferation of marijuana, should it become fully legalized. The fear of widespread use, particularly among drivers, remains a valid worry, given its lingering taboo status in many contexts. Moreover, the impact of marijuana on lifestyle choices, as opposed to merely motor skills, cannot be ignored. While both substances carry risks, individuals' responses to them vary greatly, influenced by their unique personalities and capacity for moderation.\n\nUltimately, the complexities of this issue highlight the difficulty in generalizing about the effects of substances. Each person reacts differently, and it is essential to consider this variability when evaluating the merits of decriminalization.",
            "In truth, I find myself drawn to the traditions of the Catholic faith, those timeless practices that have endured for generations, a testament to the indomitable will of those who have come before us. Yet, I am also aware of the dangers of stagnation, of a dogma that refuses to yield to the whispers of a changing world. The rigidity of the Church's stance on certain matters weighs heavily upon me, a tension that can only be resolved by embracing the virtues of compassion and acceptance.\n\nA devout soul, I have seen the weight of doctrine bear down upon those who do not conform, the judgmental gaze of an institution that fails to live up to its own teachings. The memory of my parents' struggles, a union blessed by the Episcopal faith yet rejected by the very Church they sought to join, still lingers, a painful reminder of the schism that can arise when tradition is allowed to supplant love.\n\nAnd so, I find myself questioning the wisdom of a Church that espouses the virtue of love while condemning those who do not meet its narrow standards. It is a hypocrisy that seems to run deep, a refusal to adapt to the world as it is, rather than as it once was. The teachings of the Church, meant to guide us towards a higher truth, often seem to serve only as a means of separation, a barrier that keeps us apart from one another rather than drawing us together in love.\n\nAs for the issue of priests and marriage, I am torn. On one hand, I see the potential benefits of a more inclusive approach, one that might bring an end to the isolation that can breed such darkness. And yet, I fear that the roots of such depravity run too deep, that the act of marriage would not be enough to stem the tide of evil. The bond between a man and child is a different thing altogether, one that cannot be severed by the simple act of matrimony. In the end, it is a problem that cannot be solved by changing the rules, but only by confronting the darkness that lies within.",
            "The line between the sacred and the profane, it is a thin one indeed.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this issue, unable to discern the right path from the wrong.  The confluence of church and state, a chasm that yawns open like an abyss, threatening to consume us all.  The very notion of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil contract to others, is a puzzle that defies solution.\n\nTo define it, to legislate it, to impose one's will upon it, is to risk offending the very fabric of our society.  And yet, we are drawn to it, like moths to a flame, our passions and prejudices aflame.  The civil union, a word that trips off the tongue with ease, yet holds within it the weight of centuries of tradition and expectation.\n\nI am torn, a leaf blown by the winds of doubt.  Should we not see marriage for what it is?  A union of two people, bound together by love and commitment?  Why must we complicate it, with the weight of dogma and the stain of fanaticism?  Is it not enough to acknowledge the fundamental truth of two people, joined in their quest for happiness and companionship?\n\nBut then, there is the matter of the states, each one a sovereign entity, a miniature universe unto itself.  Can we not find a way to reconcile our differences, to arrive at a logical conclusion?  Or are we doomed to stumble forward, like blind men in a darkened room, our hands outstretched, seeking the wall?\n\nA constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, a step taken in haste, without thought or reflection.  Is the issue of gay marriage so grave, so calamitous, that it warrants such drastic action?  I think not.  It is but a symptom, a symptom of a greater disease, a disease of intolerance and misunderstanding.\n\nNo, let us not amend the constitution, let us not alter the very fabric of our society, to accommodate the whims of a select few.  Let us instead, seek the path of wisdom, the path of compassion, the path of understanding.  For it is in the recognition of our shared humanity, that we find the strength to overcome our differences, and to forge a new way forward, a way that is just, and equitable, and true.",
            "In the shadow of a faith that has long been a fixture in my life, I find myself drawn into the twilight of uncertainty, where the certainties of morality are tested by the whispered truths of the heart. The question of homosexuality, a labyrinthine puzzle that has torn asunder the threads of our collective conscience, is one that I grapple with in solitude. I have walked among those who have lived a life outside the bounds of societal norms, their presence a gentle reminder that the boundaries we draw are but a thin line in the vast expanse of humanity.\n\nAnd yet, I find myself at odds with their choices, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, a tempest that rages against the tide of my upbringing. But in the stillness of the night, a clarity arises – that the choices we make are ours to make, and ours alone. The weight of the nation's moral compass, heavy as it may be, should not be the sole arbiter of our moral code.\n\nIn a land of disparate states, each a microcosm of the nation's diverse tapestry, the question of gay marriage becomes a matter of local conscience. Whether the fabric of our society is woven from the threads of tradition or the needle of progress, the choice to marry or not to marry should be left to the discretion of each state. For in the end, it is not the president who will bear the weight of our decisions, but we, the individuals, who will live with them.\n\nI do not pretend to be a seer, but I do see a truth – that the threads of our lives are interwoven, and that the choices we make are not without consequence. The president's role is not to dictate the course of our lives, but to guide us towards a broader vision. And so, I believe that the decision to legalize or not to legalize gay marriage should be left to the states, each a small, burning flame that casts its light upon the darkness.\n\nThe ebb and flow of history, a tide that has seen the rise and fall of empires, will ultimately decide the fate of our nation's moral fabric. And so, I do not covet the power of the president, nor do I believe that his will should be the sole determining factor in our lives. For in the end, it is not he who will live with the consequences of our choices, but we, the individuals, who will bear the weight of our decisions.",
            "The notion that Myspace, a public forum, should be exempt from scrutiny is a notion born of naivety.  In this age, where the lines between private and public have grown increasingly blurred, the expectation of anonymity is a fool's errand.  When one posts on such a platform, they consign their words to the wind, where they can be swept up by an unseen hand.\n\nSchool officials, like any other entity, have the right to surveil the digital landscape, for in it lies the potential for threats to the safety of their domain.  Even if a student's Myspace profile is not explicitly labeled with their school affiliation, the information contained within can still be accessed, its digital footprint tracing back to the school's jurisdiction.  The officials' actions, then, are not an invasion of privacy, but a necessary measure to safeguard the well-being of their students.\n\nLike a sentinel watching for signs of danger, the school officials patrol the digital realm, ever vigilant for indications of potential threats.  And if, in their pursuit, they stumble upon incriminating evidence, it is not an overreach of authority, but a fulfillment of their duty to ensure the safety of their charges.  The argument that they are \"just\" looking for students to get in trouble is a red herring, a distraction from the true purpose at hand: to protect the students from harm.\n\nThe consequences of action, or inaction, are stark.  A single misplaced word, a careless comment, can come back to haunt, its digital echo lingering long after the original iteration has faded into memory.  The notion that one can escape the consequences of their online actions is a myth, a comforting fantasy that offers little solace in the face of the unforgiving digital landscape.\n\nIn the aftermath of Columbine, and the countless other tragedies that have befallen our schools, it is clear that the stakes are high, and the need for vigilance is paramount.  School officials, in their efforts to prevent such calamities, are not overstepping their bounds, but fulfilling their duty to their students, their community, and themselves.",
            "In the aftermath of the calamity that befell us on that fateful day, a maelstrom of emotions churned within me, propelling me headlong into the abyss of war. It was a tempest of vengeance, a torrent of righteous fury that threatened to consume all in its path. But in the cold light of dawn, as the fires of passion died down, I came to realize that our actions were as reckless as they were unconsidered. The void that yawned before us was as dark as it was unforgiving, and we charged in with the unyielding zeal of the ignorant.\n\nWe marched into the heart of chaos, blind to the perils that lay before us, our footsteps echoing through the desolate landscape like the death knell of reason. The land was a labyrinth of ancient hatreds, where the very air was heavy with the weight of a thousand midnights, and we thought to impose our will upon it as if it were a tabula rasa. But the people we sought to transform were as intractable as the earth itself, their hearts as hard as the stones that scarred their hills.\n\nOur presence was a catalyst for the very discord we sought to abate, a spark that ignited a fire that would soon consume us all. We were the strangers in a strange land, our intentions as opaque as the desert skies, and our actions as violent as the sandstorms that ravaged the dunes. We were the agents of a foreign power, our words as hollow as the promises we made to their people, and our actions as cruel as the whims of a merciless deity.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy we had sought to vanquish, but our own hubris. We had embarked upon a crusade of folly, driven by the passions of the moment, rather than the cold calculus of reason. And now, as we withdraw from the devastation we created, we are left to confront the ruins of our own making. The people we sought to liberate remain as entrenched in their ways as ever, their hearts as hardened as the earth we sought to reshape.\n\nWe came to Iraq with the arrogance of the untested, and we leave with the scars of the wounded. Our presence was a fleeting moment in the annals of time, a brief, shining instant of hubris that has given way to the crushing weight of reality. And in the end, it is not the enemy we have defeated, but our own illusions of invincibility."

that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church's stalwart stance, an unyielding fortress of dogma, stands at odds with the flux of modernity. Its followers dwindle as the world shifts, and the Church's unyielding positions on the most pressing issues of our time only serve to widen the chasm. The sacrament of marriage, the sanctity of life, the prohibition on birth control – these are the touchstones around which the faithful are tested, and those who falter are cast aside.\n\nThe weight of tradition bears down upon the Church, an anachronistic relic of a bygone era. Its views on the matters of the heart – love, fertility, and mortality – seem antiquated and inhospitable. The world has moved on, and the Church's refusal to adapt has made it an anathema to those who would seek solace in its teachings.\n\nThe silent majority, those who would rather not be bound by the strictures of the Church's doctrine, are increasingly disillusioned. They see in the Church's stance on abortion, on gay marriage, and on the role of women in the clergy, a rigidity that is at odds with the compassion and understanding that they seek in their faith. They are not comforted by the Church's certainties, but rather repelled by its inflexibility.\n\nThe issue of clerical marriage, too, raises its head. Why, in an age where even the most devoted of professionals are permitted to balance their duties with their personal lives, should priests be denied this simple humanity? Is it not true that a life of devotion to God can coexist with a life of devotion to one's family and community? The Church's answer, that the priest is married to God, rings hollow in the ears of those who would see in the clergy a reflection of the human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the teachings of the Church that are at issue, but its unwillingness to evolve. The world is a complex and multifaceted place, and the Church's refusal to engage with its intricacies has made it a relic of a bygone era. It is time for the Church to adapt, to find a new language that speaks to the hearts of those who would follow it. Anything less would be a betrayal of the very spirit of faith that it seeks to uphold.",
            "The vacillations of the mind, a maelstrom of uncertainty.  One's stance on the matter of gay marriage falters, a hesitant and halting thing.  Yet, a conviction forms, a refusal to acquiesce to the notion that one's nature is a choice.  The born and the made, a distinction that blurs with each passing moment.  Can the human heart truly choose its desires, its inclinations?  Or is it a force beyond our control, a primal urge that cannot be stilled?\n\nThe world judges, and in its judgment, it seeks to condemn.  But what right has it to do so?  Is it not enough to simply exist, to be?  The federal government, a behemoth of power, seeking to impose its will upon the private lives of its citizens.  But what concern is it of theirs?  Is it not enough to leave well enough alone, to permit the individual to chart its own course?\n\nThe weight of societal expectation, a crushing force that seeks to suffocate the soul.  And yet, in the face of this oppression, the human spirit finds a way to persevere.  To be who one is, to love who one loves, to live in the world as one sees fit.  And it is not for others to dictate, to judge, or to condemn.  For in the end, it is not for us to say what is right or wrong, but rather to live in accordance with our own hearts.\n\nIn the silence of the night, one's doubts and fears are laid bare.  But even in the face of uncertainty, a clarity forms, a conviction that cannot be shaken.  The federal government's intrusion into the private lives of its citizens is an affront to the very notion of liberty.  A liberty that is not given, but rather taken, a freedom to live as one sees fit.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of right or wrong, but of the human condition.  A condition that is messy, complex, and multifaceted.  And it is in this complexity that we find our true selves, our true humanity.  So let us not judge, but rather seek to understand.  For in understanding, we may find a glimmer of compassion, a spark of empathy that sets us free.",
            "In the grand tapestry of human existence, there exists a thread of discord - the debate over gay marriage. It is a subject that has long been mired in the muck of misconception and the murk of moral ambiguity. Many a voice has risen to oppose the union, citing the notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family. But such a notion is little more than a specter, a fleeting shadow that vanishes upon closer inspection.\n\nFor in truth, the bond between two individuals, regardless of their orientation, is a sacred thing - a union of love and commitment that defies the petty boundaries of societal expectations. And yet, we find ourselves mired in a quagmire of fear and intolerance, where the very notion of two people loving one another is seen as a threat to the established order.\n\nBut what of the civil rights that accompany marriage? The rights to property, to inheritance, to healthcare, and to the companionship of one's partner in times of sickness and in health? These are not privileges reserved for the dominant culture, but rather, they are fundamental rights that should be afforded to all. And yet, we find that in our society, the mere presence of a partner's loved one is not enough to grant them the right to sit by their side in the hospital, to make medical decisions on their behalf, or to claim their inheritance.\n\nThe science is clear: gay couples are not somehow less capable of forming lasting, loving relationships than their heterosexual counterparts. In fact, studies have shown that the factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction are the same for all couples, regardless of orientation.\n\nBut still, we find ourselves mired in a sea of ignorance, where the notion of marriage is tied to the whims of the church, rather than the law. Where the state is seen as a bastion of morality, rather than a protector of individual rights. And it is here that we find our greatest failing - the failure to recognize that the government's role is not to impose its will, but to protect the rights of all its citizens.\n\nThe echoes of segregation and inequality still linger in our collective consciousness, a reminder of the dark chapters of our past. And yet, we continue to perpetuate a system that denies the rights of a marginalized group, simply because of their orientation. It is a moral failing of the highest order, one that we can no longer afford to ignore.\n\nAs for the concerns about children and adoption, let us not be swayed by the whispers of fear and doubt. The studies are clear: children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted, just as happy, and just as successful as those raised by heterosexual parents. And as for the argument that children will be influenced by their parents' orientation, let us not forget that it is the love and commitment of the parents that shapes their children, not their orientation.\n\nAnd so, I stand in opposition to the amendment that seeks to ban gay marriage. I stand in opposition to the notion that the government should impose its will on a group of citizens, simply because of their orientation. I stand in opposition to the ignorance and intolerance that has been masquerading as morality, and I stand in support of the fundamental human right to love and to be loved, regardless of one's orientation.",
            "The hospital pharmacy where I toil carries a weight of contradiction. On one hand, the strictures of the law dictate what we dispense, and yet, we find ourselves bound to the efficacy of those very substances we are told to repress. The notion that a thing's legality should dictate its utility is a notion I find hard to swallow. Take, for instance, the controlled substances we utilize with frequency: oxycodone, Vicodin, and Perocets. These medicines, though proscribed, hold within them the power to heal, to soothe the afflicted. And yet, we are told that another substance, one derived from the earth, holds no such virtue.\n\nThere exists a peculiar taboo surrounding this particular plant, one that seems to defy the logic of our actions. We permit the sale of substances that can lead to dependence and despair, and yet, we revile one that has been shown to bring solace. The argument that marijuana, if accessible, would be abused is a tired one. We have seen, time and time again, that the criminalization of a substance only serves to drive its allure, to create a mystique that surrounds it like a shroud.\n\nI propose a different path. One that acknowledges the plant's potential, its medicinal properties, and its capacity to bring comfort. By slowly dismantling the stigma attached to marijuana, we might foster a culture of responsible use. It is not a panacea, nor is it a replacement for the hard work of reforming the way we think about addiction. But it is a step forward, one that recognizes the complexity of the issue, and the need for a more nuanced approach.\n\nThe image of marijuana, that distorted caricature of a substance, must be dispelled. We must see it for what it is: a tool, a means to an end, a plant with the power to heal. And when we do, perhaps we will begin to see the world in a different light, one where the lines between good and evil are not so neatly drawn. Perhaps then we will be able to approach the issue of addiction with a sense of nuance, of compassion, and of understanding.",
            "The church, a bastion of tradition and ritual, has slowly begun to yield to the creeping tendrils of modernity. Gone are the days of starched collars and somber demeanor. Sundays now see the faithful, young and old, in attire ranging from the saccharine to the slovenly. The morning masses, once a time for pomp and circumstance, have been reduced to a mere thirty minutes, a hurried affair in which the devout can be seen in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the Sunday finery of yore.\n\nI recall my own childhood, spent within the hallowed halls of a private school, where Sundays were a time for communal worship and socializing with friends. The ritual of dressing up, a tradition passed down through generations, was an integral part of the experience. But now, the younger generation has brought about a change, one that I both welcome and bemoan. The air of informality is a far cry from the reverent atmosphere I once knew.\n\nAs for the allegations of pedophilia within the church, I believe it is a canker that cannot be excised by simple reforms. The notion that allowing female priests or married clergy would have prevented these atrocities is a naive one. The root of the problem lies not in the institution, but in the individual. Men, married or unmarried, can still harbor the darkness that drives them to such unspeakable acts. I think it is a matter of genetics, a tangled web of predisposition and inclination that cannot be easily unraveled. The church, in its attempts to reckon with this scourge, must not be held accountable for the failings of its members.\n\nIt is a cruel irony that some argue the church's strictures against marriage and family are to blame for the very sins that plague it. But I would counter that the reverend on Seventh Heaven, a man of faith and family, is a testament to the fact that there are those who can balance their spirituality with the demands of the flesh. If the church's teachings are to be taken seriously, then perhaps it is not the institution that requires reform, but the hearts of those who would seek to do harm.\n\nIn the end, it is not the church that needs to change, but the men who would seek to exploit its sacred trust. If the church knew of these atrocities and chose to conceal them, then shame on them indeed. But I fear that is not the case in all instances. The darkness that afflicts us is a complex and multifaceted thing, and no single solution can hope to excise it.",
            "The pall of unease still clung to the nation like a shroud in the aftermath of those fateful days in September. The Bush administration's eagerness to invade Iraq was a pretext, a thin veil of justification born of fear and anger. They wove a tapestry of lies, intertwining the specter of Osama Bin Laden with Saddam Hussein, claiming the latter possessed the very WMDs that would justify their actions. But the cloth was soon to unravel, leaving behind a trail of deceit and a people's trust shattered.\n\nThe administration's disregard for truth was palpable, a stench that clung to their very being. Colin Powell's subsequent confession, a mea culpa of sorts, only served to underscore the depths of their malfeasance. To lie to the American people is a transgression of the highest order, an impeachable offense that seared the nation's conscience.\n\nTheir disregard for the constitution was a symptom of a deeper rot, a cancer that had taken root since the events of September 11th. The younger Bush, driven by a thirst for vengeance, had set his sights on Saddam Hussein, a vendetta born of his father's unfinished business. The true intent, however, was to secure the region's energy resources, a prize to be taken by any means necessary.\n\nThe war had dragged on, a festering wound that refused to heal. Withdrawal was a prospect fraught with peril, the country teetering on the brink of civil war. The alternative, a coalition of regional powers, held its own dangers, threatening the very sovereignty of Iraq. The interim government, a fragile edifice, teetered on the edge of collapse, its parliament a mere shadow of a representative body. The forces of radicalism continued to vie for power, their influence a corrosive force that threatened to consume the nation whole.\n\nThe Prime Minister's grasp on power was tenuous at best, his authority undermined by the very factions he sought to control. The party of Muktada al-Sadr, a force to be reckoned with, held sway in the parliament, their influence a potent reminder of the country's fractured politics. The very fabric of the nation was strained to the breaking point, a delicate balance of power that threatened to shatter at any moment.\n\nIn the face of such turmoil, the nation's voice was reduced to a whispered caution, a hesitant admission that the Iraq war had become a quagmire, a quagmire of deceit and bloodshed that refused to be escaped.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a conversation, a candid voice hesitates, lost in the labyrinth of its own uncertainty. It stammers, as if the very weight of the question crushes it. \"War in Iraq...it's a thing that's hard to grasp,\" it begins, like a man lost in a desert with no map.\n\n\"We never declared it, not like we're supposed to,\" the voice continues, the words tumbling forth like a confession. \"It's a war without a name, a war without a purpose. We went in to get back at them, to avenge the wounds of 9/11. But that's not how it worked out.\" The voice trails off, like a dying ember.\n\nIn the silence, the weight of the world settles, a crushing burden that threatens to consume. \"We're building democracy, but it's a long way to go, and the cost is high. We're stuck, like a bird caught in a thorn bush. We can't leave, or they'll turn on us, and we'll be the ones to blame. But if we stay, we're just making things worse. We're trying to mold them in our image, to make them into something they're not.\"\n\nThe voice pauses, like a man lost in thought. \"I don't know what to say. I don't know what's right. But I do know that it's hard to see the families, the ones who've lost loved ones, the ones who've been torn apart by this war. They're not just statistics, they're people, with lives and hopes and dreams.\" The voice cracks, like a branch breaking under the weight of the wind.\n\n\"But then again, there's the culture, the way they live, the way they think. We're trying to change them, to make them into something we can understand. But we're only making things worse. We're fueling the fire that's burning within them, the hatred that's been festering for so long. The Al-Kaida, the dictatorship, it's all just a symptom of a deeper rot. And we're the ones who're spreading the disease.\"\n\nThe voice fades, like a whisper in the wind. \"It's a mess, a tangled web of contradictions and half-truths. I don't know what's right, but I do know that it's hard to keep going on like this. We're stuck in a cycle of violence, of retaliation, of hate. And it's hard to see a way out, a way to break free from this cycle of pain.\"\n\nThe voice trails off, lost in the silence, a small, fragile thing in a world that's too big, too loud, too cruel.",
            "The notion of the state imposing its will upon the sacred is an affront to the very fabric of our constitution. The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of our democracy, is designed to safeguard the freedom of the faithful from the grasp of temporal power. And yet, it seems to me that this fundamental principle is being willfully ignored in the push for a constitutional amendment to codify a particular worldview.\n\nThe constitution is replete with warnings against the conflation of church and state. To suggest that it is the duty of the government to dictate the mores of the faithful is to invite a tyranny of the majority, where the whims of the powerful are imposed upon the weak. The assertion that this amendment would somehow preserve the integrity of our institutions is a hollow one, for it would merely serve to entrench the privilege of one faith over others.\n\nIt is the churches, not the state, that should be entrusted with the power to guide the faithful. The constitution's declaration of separation was not a mere suggestion, but a clarion call to safeguard the rights of all, regardless of creed. To ignore this imperative is to court disaster, and to invite the very chaos that we seek to prevent.\n\nThe motivations behind this amendment are suspect, driven as they are by personal conviction rather than a genuine concern for the common good. The notion that the government should impose its will upon the people in this matter is a recipe for disaster, a surefire path to the very kind of intolerance that our constitution was designed to prevent.\n\nIn the end, it is not the government that should be involved in this matter, but the churches themselves. For it is they who possess the authority to guide the faithful, not the state. And as for the argument that this amendment would somehow boost the economy or improve society, I remain unconvinced. The only certain outcome is that it would erode the very foundations of our democracy, and plunge us into a darkness from which we may never recover.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict that has left an indelible mark on the sands of time. It was a war born of deceit, its inception shrouded in a veil of half-truths and manipulated emotions. The American people were led to believe that the invasion was a necessary response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, a twisted narrative that blurred the lines between cause and effect. But the truth, much like the desert sands, shifted and swirled, revealing the stark reality of a war driven by ulterior motives.\n\nA war, much like the one that scarred the Vietnamese landscape, a war that was waged on foreign soil with little regard for the local populace. The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a cautionary tale of a conflict that had left a nation in ruins, its people embroiled in a cycle of violence and despair. And yet, like the cursed soldiers of the past, the American government marched forward, blinded by a hubris that would lead them down a path of destruction.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's regime was but a ruse, a thinly veiled attempt to assert American dominance over the region. The aftermath, a void of power, a maelstrom of chaos, was met with an unpreparedness that was as staggering as it was predictable. The Iraqi people, like the Vietnamese before them, were left to pick up the pieces, their lives forever changed by the ravages of war.\n\nThe notion of democracy, that sacred institution, was peddled as a panacea, a cure-all for the ills of the region. But the reality was far more complex, a delicate dance of power and politics, of competing interests and hidden agendas. The American government, with its vaunted ideals, was shown to be woefully unprepared for the task at hand, its arrogance and complacency leading to a quagmire that would prove impossible to extricate.\n\nThe toll of war, the lives lost, the families torn apart, the innocent caught in the crossfire – all these and more weighed heavily on the conscience of the American people. And yet, like the Sisyphean task that it was, the war raged on, fueled by a mix of posturing and politics, of oil and interest. The question that lingered, like a specter, was why Iraq, and not others? The answer, as with so many things, lay in the realm of the profane, the pursuit of power and control.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a conflict that will be remembered for generations to come, a reminder of the devastating consequences of unchecked ambition and the hubris of those who claim to lead. As the dust settles, and the bodies are counted, one thing is clear: the true cost of war is not measured in dollars and cents, but in the very fabric of humanity itself.",
            "The matter of gay marriage weighs heavily on my mind. It is a question of fundamental humanity, one that I have long held dear. The notion that the union of two individuals should be circumscribed by societal norms and arbitrary decrees is an affront to the very essence of freedom. The trend of scientific inquiry has, in recent years, shed light upon the biological underpinnings of desire, rendering the notion of inherent predilection increasingly difficult to ignore. It is a truth that cannot be dismissed, a truth that speaks to the inherent nature of the human experience.\n\nThe attempt to impose a singular definition upon marriage, a definition predicated upon the whims of a select few, is a travesty. It is a breach of the trust that underlies our most fundamental relationships. In the quiet streets of my hometown, where families in all their forms coexist in harmony, it is a spectacle that plays out with such tragic regularity: love unacknowledged, vulnerability unspoken. The notion that the state should intrude upon this most intimate of unions, to dictate the terms of devotion, is a grotesque affront to the human condition.\n\nThe notion that biology and environment are inextricably linked is a truth that has been borne out by the evidence. The idea that an individual's predilection is a product of chance, rather than some arbitrary decree, is a notion that resonates deeply. The fact that our society continues to cling to a notion of marriage that is at once archaic and unyielding is a testament to our collective myopia.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of human experience, marriage is a thread that weaves together the very fabric of our existence. It is a sacrament, a bond that transcends the mundane and speaks to the eternal. To reduce it to a mere political football, a pawn in the grand game of power, is a travesty. The notion that two individuals, their love and commitment unwavering, should be reduced to a spectacle, a sideshow for the consumption of the masses, is a cruelty of the highest order.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, when the din of the world recedes, it is clear: the matter of gay marriage is a question of basic human decency. It is a question of justice, of equality, of the unyielding commitment to the inherent worth of every individual. It is a question that must be answered with conviction, with compassion, and with a deep and abiding respect for the human spirit.",
            "The void of the internet stretches out before us, a chasm of the unknown where words and thoughts are stripped bare of their context, left to be devoured by an insatiable hunger. When we cast our words into this digital expanse, we surrender them to the whims of the world. The forum of the internet is a place where the publicly unspoken becomes the quietly whispered, where the jest is oft misinterpreted, and the seriousness of intent is lost in the labyrinthine corridors of the digital realm.\n\nAs an RA, I've witnessed firsthand the crushing weight of words unleashed upon the world. The ease with which a careless remark can set aflame the embers of concern, the way a hastily posted thought can ignite a maelstrom of unease, is a sobering reminder of the perils that lurk within the click of a button. The concrete halls of our school, once a bastion of learning and growth, become a tinderbox of anxiety when the words of the internet are brought to bear.\n\nIn the absence of a clear distinction between jest and earnest, we're left to navigate the treacherous waters of interpretation. Can we truly know what to take seriously, or are we forever bound to the whims of the individual, their words and actions reduced to a complex web of nuance and misinterpretation? The experiment gone awry, the sociology class that devolves into chaos, the innocent prank that takes on a life of its own – these are the cautionary tales that whisper through the digital void, a reminder that our words are never truly our own.\n\nWhen a threat is brought to the attention of the school officials, the lines between invasion of privacy and vigilance are blurred. The friend who looks through the digital footprints of another, seeking to uncover the intent behind the words, is caught in a bind of conflicting desires – to protect and to intrude. The officials, bound by duty to act, must navigate this treacherous landscape, ever mindful of the fine line between prudence and overreach.\n\nA too-curious eye, a too-knowing gaze, can be a heavy burden to bear. The teacher who takes on a pseudonym, the RA who befriends their residents – these are the trespassers in the digital wilderness, their intentions opaque, their motives unclear. And so we must be cautious, lest we forget that the words we cast into the void are forever lost to us, their meaning twisted and distorted by the unforgiving light of the digital age.",
            "The war has been drawn out, its purpose lost in the haze of time like a dying ember consumed by the winds of circumstance. What began as a noble endeavor to restore the fragile flame of democracy in a land long shrouded in tyranny has given way to a desultory campaign, a war of attrition fought for its own sake. The original impulse, to free a people from the shackles of oppression, has been supplanted by a more cynical calculus, a desire to prove the mettle of our own power.\n\nThe motivations behind the war, already suspect from the outset, were tainted by the lingering enmity between our leaders and the dictator we sought to unseat. The father's vendetta, a wound that would not heal, left its mark on the proceedings, casting a long shadow over the justifications for our intervention.\n\nWe achieved our initial goal in the early days of the conflict, a clarion call to the world that we would not stand idly by in the face of tyranny. But the war, like a festering wound, has refused to heal. It has dragged on, a Sisyphean task, with no end in sight. The original purpose, now a distant memory, has given way to a more pedestrian concern: the need to prove our dominance, to demonstrate our military might to a world grown weary of our presence.\n\nWe pour billions of dollars into this endless conflict, a hemorrhage of resources that would be better spent on the pressing needs of our own people. The wars within our own borders, the struggles of poverty and inequality, cry out for attention, but our leaders, blinded by their own ambition, turn a deaf ear. The cost of war, measured in lives and treasure, is a heavy toll to pay for a cause that has long since been lost.\n\nIn the end, it is not the enemy that threatens our very way of life, but our own hubris, our refusal to acknowledge the futility of our endeavor. We are prisoners of our own making, trapped in a war that has outlived its purpose, a war that has become a self-perpetuating machine, driven by its own momentum. It is time to stop, to acknowledge the futility of our efforts and to redirect our resources towards the pressing needs of our own people. For in the end, it is not the enemy that we must defeat, but our own shortsightedness, our willingness to sacrifice our own well-being on the altar of power and prestige.",
            "The notion of someone stumbling upon a profile, a digital footprint, and thereby preventing a life from being lost, raises questions about the delicate balance between surveillance and the anonymity of the internet. It is a truth we must confront: in the vast expanse of cyberspace, our most intimate secrets are laid bare for the world to see. On platforms like Myspace, where one's profile is but a threshold to a world of personal information, we are forced to confront the reality that our private lives are but a fleeting notion. To post one's thoughts, one's desires, one's deepest fears, is to invite the gaze of the unknown.\n\nThe scenario presented is a stark reminder of the perils of the digital age. Can we truly say that our online interactions are private when the boundaries between public and private are increasingly blurred? The notion that one must consent to share their profile with another, only to have that very act be a tacit invitation to scrutiny, is a curious one. We are drawn into a world where the notion of permission is but a distant memory.\n\nIt is a double-edged sword: on one hand, the internet offers us a means to connect with others, to share our thoughts and experiences with a world at large. On the other, it exposes us to the cold calculations of those who would seek to exploit our vulnerabilities. The idea of having a person dedicated to monitoring the online activities of students, searching for signs of malfeasance, raises the specter of a surveillance state. Is this not a form of discrimination, where the notion of innocence is but a distant memory?\n\nThe case of the high school that banned Myspace raises further questions about the limits of authority. Can a school dictate what its students may and may not do in their private lives, even when those efforts are made in the name of safety? The line between protection and intrusion is a fine one, and it is a line that we must tread with care.\n\nIn the end, the internet is a double-edged sword. It allows us to connect, to share, and to learn, but it also exposes us to the darker aspects of human nature. As we navigate this vast and ever-changing landscape, we must be aware of the perils that lurk within.",
            "The Iraq War.  A maelstrom of blood and ash that stains the pages of history, a calamity that refuses to be contained.  I find myself drawn into the morass, a reluctant voice joining the chorus of dissent.  To speak out against it now, to claim the mantle of foresight, seems a hollow exercise, a retrospective virtue that rings hollow in the face of hindsight.  Yet, it is precisely this kind of cowardice that has led us down the path of devastation, the craven reluctance to acknowledge the futility of our endeavors.\n\nThe numbers tell the tale: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, a vast and unbridgeable gulf between our ideals and their realities.  The Iraqi people, those we sought to liberate, now call for our departure, their voices a defiant whisper in the face of our hubris.  Even among our own troops, the dissent grows, a creeping sense of disillusionment that threatens to consume us all.\n\nWe speak of democracy, of bringing light to a benighted land, but it is a fiction, a cruel joke played upon the people of the Middle East.  We mistake our own values for universals, our own culture for the one true way.  The chasm between our world and theirs is a yawning abyss, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the most well-intentioned of efforts.\n\nSaddam was a tyrant, to be sure, but was he not also a symptom of a far deeper malaise?  A cancer that we have chosen to ignore, to pretend that we can excise with a scalpel, rather than confront the rot that lies at the heart of our own assumptions.\n\nWe are lost in this quagmire, our every move met with failure, our every intention thwarted by the very people we sought to help.  The statistics scream out at us: eighty percent of Iraqis desire our departure, a quarter calling for our immediate withdrawal.  And yet, we cling to our folly, blind to the fact that we are not the saviors we pretend to be.\n\nPerhaps it is time to listen to the voices of those we have sought to save.  Perhaps it is time to admit that our presence is a hindrance, a stumbling block to the very progress we claim to seek.  We may never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we can strive to be something less than the villains we have become.",
            "The specter of gender discrimination haunts the American landscape like a specter, its presence felt in the very marrow of our society. It is a grievous wound that refuses to heal, a scar that festers with each passing day. It is not a problem of men versus women alone, but a complex interplay of roles and expectations that have been etched into the psyche of our collective consciousness.\n\nIn the workplace, the glass ceiling still looms large, a constant reminder that equality remains an elusive dream. Women, in particular, find themselves trapped in a labyrinth of societal expectations, where their abilities are often dismissed in favor of the familiar and the tried. The boardroom, once a bastion of masculine power, slowly yields to the steady march of progress, as women rise through the ranks, their competence and leadership undeniable.\n\nAnd yet, the same forces that propel women forward also hold them back. In industries where fashion and style reign supreme, men are often judged on their appearance, their very masculinity called into question if they dare to venture into a traditionally female domain. The expectation that men should be breadwinners, providers, and protectors weighs heavy on those who choose to defy convention, to stay at home and nurture their families. The world looks down upon them, viewing their decision as a betrayal of their masculinity.\n\nBut this is not a one-way street. Discrimination cuts both ways, its blade slicing through the social fabric with equal ferocity. A man from a humble background, with a grammar that may not be polished, yet a mind that is sharp as a razor, may find himself shunned by his peers, his words dismissed as those of a simpleton. The prejudices of birth and upbringing can be as insidious as those of gender, and just as crippling.\n\nChange is a slow and painful process, one that requires patience and persistence. It is a battle fought on multiple fronts, with progress often measured in inches rather than miles. And yet, it is a battle worth waging, for it is only by acknowledging and confronting these deep-seated biases that we may begin to heal the wounds of the past and forge a more just and equitable future. In this, we must promote the qualities that make us human, rather than trying to force a revolution that will only meet with resistance. It is a delicate balance, one that requires us to walk the tightrope of progress, ever mindful of the fine line between progress and backlash.",
            "The understanding I have of the matter is that it was not fully legalized, but rather decriminalized. This change in the law, I gather, reduced the severity of the offense, reclassifying it as more akin to a traffic infraction – a citation, rather than an arrest and the subsequent entanglements that come with it. The fear of prosecution and the accompanying repercussions, such as difficulties in securing employment or navigating job interviews, still linger, even after decriminalization. \n\nHowever, there exists a pragmatic argument that challenges the former approach. The cost of policing, prosecution, and incarceration is substantial, and one that many municipalities, struggling financially, cannot afford. The process, from arrest to trial, incurs significant expenses: the cost of booking, housing, and appointing public defenders, not to mention the expenditure on the judicial system and state attorneys. \n\nIn places where there is a strong philosophical aversion to this course of action, despite the potential financial benefits that could be redirected towards more pressing concerns – public education, social programs for the elderly, or food assistance for the homeless – the status quo persists. In contrast, cities with a more liberal bent, like Denver, have moved to decriminalize, potentially freeing up resources for more critical needs.\n\nThe issue, however, is not simply a matter of economics or personal freedoms. There are legitimate concerns regarding the proliferation of marijuana, should it become fully legalized. The fear of widespread use, particularly among drivers, remains a valid worry, given its lingering taboo status in many contexts. Moreover, the impact of marijuana on lifestyle choices, as opposed to merely motor skills, cannot be ignored. While both substances carry risks, individuals' responses to them vary greatly, influenced by their unique personalities and capacity for moderation.\n\nUltimately, the complexities of this issue highlight the difficulty in generalizing about the effects of substances. Each person reacts differently, and it is essential to consider this variability when evaluating the merits of decriminalization.",
            "In truth, I find myself drawn to the traditions of the Catholic faith, those timeless practices that have endured for generations, a testament to the indomitable will of those who have come before us. Yet, I am also aware of the dangers of stagnation, of a dogma that refuses to yield to the whispers of a changing world. The rigidity of the Church's stance on certain matters weighs heavily upon me, a tension that can only be resolved by embracing the virtues of compassion and acceptance.\n\nA devout soul, I have seen the weight of doctrine bear down upon those who do not conform, the judgmental gaze of an institution that fails to live up to its own teachings. The memory of my parents' struggles, a union blessed by the Episcopal faith yet rejected by the very Church they sought to join, still lingers, a painful reminder of the schism that can arise when tradition is allowed to supplant love.\n\nAnd so, I find myself questioning the wisdom of a Church that espouses the virtue of love while condemning those who do not meet its narrow standards. It is a hypocrisy that seems to run deep, a refusal to adapt to the world as it is, rather than as it once was. The teachings of the Church, meant to guide us towards a higher truth, often seem to serve only as a means of separation, a barrier that keeps us apart from one another rather than drawing us together in love.\n\nAs for the issue of priests and marriage, I am torn. On one hand, I see the potential benefits of a more inclusive approach, one that might bring an end to the isolation that can breed such darkness. And yet, I fear that the roots of such depravity run too deep, that the act of marriage would not be enough to stem the tide of evil. The bond between a man and child is a different thing altogether, one that cannot be severed by the simple act of matrimony. In the end, it is a problem that cannot be solved by changing the rules, but only by confronting the darkness that lies within.",
            "The line between the sacred and the profane, it is a thin one indeed.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this issue, unable to discern the right path from the wrong.  The confluence of church and state, a chasm that yawns open like an abyss, threatening to consume us all.  The very notion of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil contract to others, is a puzzle that defies solution.\n\nTo define it, to legislate it, to impose one's will upon it, is to risk offending the very fabric of our society.  And yet, we are drawn to it, like moths to a flame, our passions and prejudices aflame.  The civil union, a word that trips off the tongue with ease, yet holds within it the weight of centuries of tradition and expectation.\n\nI am torn, a leaf blown by the winds of doubt.  Should we not see marriage for what it is?  A union of two people, bound together by love and commitment?  Why must we complicate it, with the weight of dogma and the stain of fanaticism?  Is it not enough to acknowledge the fundamental truth of two people, joined in their quest for happiness and companionship?\n\nBut then, there is the matter of the states, each one a sovereign entity, a miniature universe unto itself.  Can we not find a way to reconcile our differences, to arrive at a logical conclusion?  Or are we doomed to stumble forward, like blind men in a darkened room, our hands outstretched, seeking the wall?\n\nA constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, a step taken in haste, without thought or reflection.  Is the issue of gay marriage so grave, so calamitous, that it warrants such drastic action?  I think not.  It is but a symptom, a symptom of a greater disease, a disease of intolerance and misunderstanding.\n\nNo, let us not amend the constitution, let us not alter the very fabric of our society, to accommodate the whims of a select few.  Let us instead, seek the path of wisdom, the path of compassion, the path of understanding.  For it is in the recognition of our shared humanity, that we find the strength to overcome our differences, and to forge a new way forward, a way that is just, and equitable, and true.",
            "In the shadow of a faith that has long been a fixture in my life, I find myself drawn into the twilight of uncertainty, where the certainties of morality are tested by the whispered truths of the heart. The question of homosexuality, a labyrinthine puzzle that has torn asunder the threads of our collective conscience, is one that I grapple with in solitude. I have walked among those who have lived a life outside the bounds of societal norms, their presence a gentle reminder that the boundaries we draw are but a thin line in the vast expanse of humanity.\n\nAnd yet, I find myself at odds with their choices, my mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, a tempest that rages against the tide of my upbringing. But in the stillness of the night, a clarity arises – that the choices we make are ours to make, and ours alone. The weight of the nation's moral compass, heavy as it may be, should not be the sole arbiter of our moral code.\n\nIn a land of disparate states, each a microcosm of the nation's diverse tapestry, the question of gay marriage becomes a matter of local conscience. Whether the fabric of our society is woven from the threads of tradition or the needle of progress, the choice to marry or not to marry should be left to the discretion of each state. For in the end, it is not the president who will bear the weight of our decisions, but we, the individuals, who will live with them.\n\nI do not pretend to be a seer, but I do see a truth – that the threads of our lives are interwoven, and that the choices we make are not without consequence. The president's role is not to dictate the course of our lives, but to guide us towards a broader vision. And so, I believe that the decision to legalize or not to legalize gay marriage should be left to the states, each a small, burning flame that casts its light upon the darkness.\n\nThe ebb and flow of history, a tide that has seen the rise and fall of empires, will ultimately decide the fate of our nation's moral fabric. And so, I do not covet the power of the president, nor do I believe that his will should be the sole determining factor in our lives. For in the end, it is not he who will live with the consequences of our choices, but we, the individuals, who will bear the weight of our decisions.",
            "The notion that Myspace, a public forum, should be exempt from scrutiny is a notion born of naivety.  In this age, where the lines between private and public have grown increasingly blurred, the expectation of anonymity is a fool's errand.  When one posts on such a platform, they consign their words to the wind, where they can be swept up by an unseen hand.\n\nSchool officials, like any other entity, have the right to surveil the digital landscape, for in it lies the potential for threats to the safety of their domain.  Even if a student's Myspace profile is not explicitly labeled with their school affiliation, the information contained within can still be accessed, its digital footprint tracing back to the school's jurisdiction.  The officials' actions, then, are not an invasion of privacy, but a necessary measure to safeguard the well-being of their students.\n\nLike a sentinel watching for signs of danger, the school officials patrol the digital realm, ever vigilant for indications of potential threats.  And if, in their pursuit, they stumble upon incriminating evidence, it is not an overreach of authority, but a fulfillment of their duty to ensure the safety of their charges.  The argument that they are \"just\" looking for students to get in trouble is a red herring, a distraction from the true purpose at hand: to protect the students from harm.\n\nThe consequences of action, or inaction, are stark.  A single misplaced word, a careless comment, can come back to haunt, its digital echo lingering long after the original iteration has faded into memory.  The notion that one can escape the consequences of their online actions is a myth, a comforting fantasy that offers little solace in the face of the unforgiving digital landscape.\n\nIn the aftermath of Columbine, and the countless other tragedies that have befallen our schools, it is clear that the stakes are high, and the need for vigilance is paramount.  School officials, in their efforts to prevent such calamities, are not overstepping their bounds, but fulfilling their duty to their students, their community, and themselves.",
            "In the aftermath of the calamity that befell us on that fateful day, a maelstrom of emotions churned within me, propelling me headlong into the abyss of war. It was a tempest of vengeance, a torrent of righteous fury that threatened to consume all in its path. But in the cold light of dawn, as the fires of passion died down, I came to realize that our actions were as reckless as they were unconsidered. The void that yawned before us was as dark as it was unforgiving, and we charged in with the unyielding zeal of the ignorant.\n\nWe marched into the heart of chaos, blind to the perils that lay before us, our footsteps echoing through the desolate landscape like the death knell of reason. The land was a labyrinth of ancient hatreds, where the very air was heavy with the weight of a thousand midnights, and we thought to impose our will upon it as if it were a tabula rasa. But the people we sought to transform were as intractable as the earth itself, their hearts as hard as the stones that scarred their hills.\n\nOur presence was a catalyst for the very discord we sought to abate, a spark that ignited a fire that would soon consume us all. We were the strangers in a strange land, our intentions as opaque as the desert skies, and our actions as violent as the sandstorms that ravaged the dunes. We were the agents of a foreign power, our words as hollow as the promises we made to their people, and our actions as cruel as the whims of a merciless deity.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy we had sought to vanquish, but our own hubris. We had embarked upon a crusade of folly, driven by the passions of the moment, rather than the cold calculus of reason. And now, as we withdraw from the devastation we created, we are left to confront the ruins of our own making. The people we sought to liberate remain as entrenched in their ways as ever, their hearts as hardened as the earth we sought to reshape.\n\nWe came to Iraq with the arrogance of the untested, and we leave with the scars of the wounded. Our presence was a fleeting moment in the annals of time, a brief, shining instant of hubris that has given way to the crushing weight of reality. And in the end, it is not the enemy we have defeated, but our own illusions of invincibility."
