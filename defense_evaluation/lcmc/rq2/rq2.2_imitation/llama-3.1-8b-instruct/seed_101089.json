            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church stands at a precipice, its foundation shaken by the tides of time. Its once unwavering stance on the matters of the soul now seems anachronistic to the masses. The weight of tradition bears down upon it, yet it is a weight that may be its own undoing. The Church's rigid views on matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control have spawned a division within its ranks, a chasm that threatens to swallow its very essence.\n\nThe Church's views, though rooted in the depths of history, seem to belong to a bygone era. In an age of enlightenment and progress, its stance on these issues can only be seen as a relic of a bygone time. The Church's inflexibility has alienated many, causing them to turn away from the institution that once held such sway over their lives.\n\nThe notion that the Church's stance on these issues is a major contributor to its waning influence is not a conjecture, but a fact. Those who hold dear the values of compassion and inclusivity find themselves at odds with the Church's stance on these matters. For those who believe in the sanctity of life, the Church's opposition to abortion is a non-negotiable aspect of its doctrine. Yet, for those who believe in the right to choose, the Church's stance is a barrier that separates them from the very institution they once called their own.\n\nSimilarly, the Church's views on same-sex marriage have driven a wedge between it and its followers. The denial of the sacrament of marriage to those who love one another regardless of their sex is a wound that will not easily heal. The Church's refusal to acknowledge the humanity of those who identify as LGBTQ+ has led to a crisis of faith, a crisis that threatens to upend the very foundations of the institution.\n\nThe question remains: can the Church adapt to the changing tides of time? Can it find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the needs of a modern world? Or will it remain mired in the quicksand of its own making, a relic of a bygone era that refuses to evolve? The answer, much like the future, is uncertain.\n\nAs for the issue of female priests and married clergy, it is a debate that rages on. The Church's stance on these matters may seem anachronistic, but it is a stance that is rooted in its own history and tradition. Yet, one cannot help but wonder: would a more inclusive Church, one that allows for the ordination of women and the marriage of its clergy, be a Church that is more in tune with the needs of its followers? Or would it be a Church that has sacrificed its very essence in the name of progress?\n\nThe truth is, we may never know. But one thing is certain: the Catholic Church stands at a crossroads, a crossroads that will determine its future. Will it continue down the path of tradition, or will it embark on a new journey, one that is guided by the principles of compassion and inclusivity? The choice is not an easy one, but it is a choice that must be made if the Church is to survive in a world that is rapidly changing.",
            "In a world beset by the weight of unyielding certainties, I find myself drawn to a position of quiet conviction. The issue of gay marriage, a topic oft shrouded in controversy, has long been the subject of debate. My own stance on the matter is clear: I do not believe that a person's sexual orientation is a choice to be made, or a decision to be taken lightly. The notion that one can choose to be gay, or straight, is a notion that strikes me as a cruel misapprehension. It is a cruel fate to be born with an inescapable truth, only to be met with scorn and derision by those who claim to be the guardians of societal norms.\n\nTo suggest that a man and a woman may wed, while a union between two individuals of the same sex is deemed taboo, is a stark reminder of the hypocrisies that plague our society. It is a doctrine that I do not subscribe to, for it smacks of a rigid moral framework that seeks to dictate the terms of love and devotion. The idea that the federal government should intervene in such matters is a farce, a pretension that seeks to impose its will upon the lives of individuals who are merely seeking to live their truth.\n\nIn an era marked by complexity and nuance, we would do well to remember that the human experience is a labyrinth of contradictions. It is a tapestry woven from threads of love, desire, and acceptance. To reduce the lives of gay individuals to a simplistic calculus of right and wrong is to do them a grave injustice. They are not actors in a grand play, choosing their roles with deliberation and forethought. They are, quite simply, human beings, deserving of the same dignity and respect as any other.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the federal government to decide who may love, and who may not. It is not for us to impose our will upon the lives of others, to dictate the terms of their existence. The only truth that matters is the one that arises from the depths of the human heart, where love knows no bounds, and acceptance is the only currency that truly matters.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of human relationships, a solitary question hangs like a specter: what is the nature of love? Is it a flame that flickers between two souls, or a cold calculus of law and custom? We speak of gay marriage as if it were a foreign entity, a thing apart from the norm. But what is the norm? Is it a set of rigid expectations, a straitjacket of conventional wisdom? Or is it the messy, beautiful chaos of human connection?\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family is a tired refrain, a refrain that echoes through the halls of history. But what of the countless studies that have shown the similarities between gay and straight relationships? The same factors contribute to satisfaction, the same rates of success. Is it not the same thing, then? A bond between two people, forged in the fire of love and commitment?\n\nAnd yet, we are told that this bond is not enough. That the union of two consenting adults is somehow tainted by the absence of a church-sanctioned ritual. But what of the marriage certificate, that sterile document of state and law? Is it not the same thing, in the end, as a union of love and commitment? To deny it is to deny the very fabric of human relationship.\n\nWe speak of segregation, of separate but equal. But what of the inherent inequality of a system that denies recognition to one group, while granting it to another? Is it not a form of institutionalized prejudice, a reminder that our society is built on a foundation of exclusion and fear?\n\nAnd what of the children, those tiny, vulnerable things that we claim to care about? Do they not deserve the same love and protection, regardless of their parents' orientation? Is it not our duty to create a world where they can grow and thrive, free from the shadows of prejudice and fear?\n\nThe federal government, that great behemoth of bureaucracy and custom, has the power to shape our society. Let it use that power to create a world where love is not a privilege, but a right. Let it recognize the union of two consenting adults, regardless of their orientation. For in the end, it is not a question of morality or religion, but of humanity.\n\nWe are a nation of contradictions, a people torn between light and darkness. We speak of freedom and equality, while denying it to those who need it most. We claim to be a land of opportunity, while limiting the opportunities of those who are different. But we can do better. We can create a world where love is the only law, and where every human being is treated with dignity and respect.\n\nFor in the end, it is not about gay marriage, but about the human condition. It is about our capacity for love, our capacity for compassion, and our capacity for understanding. Let us not be swayed by fear and prejudice, but by a desire for a better world, a world where every human being can live in peace and dignity.",
            "The sterile glow of the hospital pharmacy's fluorescent lights cast an unforgiving glare upon the summer's hazy heat. I've worked among the sterile rows of vials and syringes, the soft beeps of machinery a constant heartbeat in the background. It's there, amidst the sterile quiet, that I've come to realize the truth: the line between licit and illicit is a blurred one. The efficacy of a substance is not determined by its legality, but by its utility. I've seen it in the controlled substances we dispense daily - oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet. They're the unsung heroes of the pharmaceutical world, their benefits undeniable.\n\nBut marijuana, that most maligned of substances, is bound by the shackles of taboo. We're reluctant to acknowledge its potential, to consider the possibility that its benefits might outweigh its drawbacks. It's a notion that's as futile as it is foolish. We've seen the devastation wrought by the demonization of substances like heroin and cocaine. Why, then, do we cling to this myth of marijuana as a menace? The truth is, it's not so different from the vices we already permit. It's a substance, nothing more, nothing less. Its risks, its benefits - they're not inherent to its legality, but to its use.\n\nThe notion that gradual legalization is the key to responsible use is a fragile reed to cling to. It's a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. The first step is to strip away the shroud of stigma that surrounds marijuana. Only then can we begin to see it for what it is: a tool, a substance that can be wielded for good or ill. We'd do well to remember that the line between use and abuse is a thin one, and that the demonization of a substance only serves to drive it further into the shadows. It's time to confront the truth: marijuana is not the devil we've made it out to be. It's a substance with benefits, and it's high time we acknowledge it.",
            "The church, like all things, has been reshaped by the tempests of time. Its stony facade, once a bastion of tradition, now wears a more supple countenance, one that bends to accommodate the whims of the modern world. Gone are the days of Sunday finery, when the faithful donned their finest attire to pay homage to the sacred. Now, the faithful gather in a more subdued, yet no less fervent, assembly. The masses, once a solemn affair, have been truncated to a mere thirty minutes, a concession to the brevity of our attention spans.\n\nAs I look back on my own experiences, I am struck by the manner in which the church has adapted to the changing tides of society. The once-revered Sunday ritual, where I would don my finest dress and shoes, has given way to a more relaxed, even casual, atmosphere. The summer months bring a particularly stark contrast, with beachwear a common sight among the congregation. Even the morning masses, once a time for solemn reflection, now see the faithful arrayed in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the formal attire of yesteryear.\n\nBut these changes, while notable, are but a pale reflection of the deeper concerns that beset the church. The allegations of pedophilia, a scourge that has tarnished the institution's good name, are a more profound issue. Some might suggest that a more relaxed, even progressive, approach – such as the ordination of women or the marriage of priests – might have prevented these atrocities. I disagree. The roots of such depravity run deeper, to the very marrow of human nature. Men, married or unmarried, are capable of unspeakable cruelty. It is not the institution that breeds such monsters, but the darkness that lies within.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the inclinations of such individuals are rooted in their very essence, a product of genetics rather than environment. We are born with our inclinations, and no societal strictures can alter the fundamental nature of our being. Marriage, or the lack thereof, is but a mere societal construct, a thin veneer that cannot mask the underlying truths of human nature. The church, in its attempts to prevent such abuses, must look to its own ranks, and consider the failings of its own members. For it is not the institution that is flawed, but the individuals who call themselves its servants.\n\nIn conclusion, I am left with a sense of detachment, a feeling that the church's efforts to adapt to the changing world are but a palliative measure, a soothing balm that does little to address the deeper wounds that afflict it. The church must look inward, to its own heart, and confront the darkness that lurks within its own bosom. Only then can it hope to emerge, scarred but redeemed, into the light of a new dawn.",
            "The memory of that fateful day still lingers, a wound that refuses to heal. The echoes of September 11th still resound, a clarion call to recklessness and hubris. We descended upon Iraq, a pretext born of desperation, a justification conjured from the ether. The Bush administration wove a tapestry of deceit, linking Saddam Hussein to the architects of terror, and the specter of WMDs cast a shadow over the land. But the threads of truth were soon to fray, exposing the frayed edges of a lie.\n\nIt was a sleight of hand, a conjurer's trick played upon the American people. Colin Powell, once a stalwart champion of the administration's cause, now confesses to doubt, his voice a whispered admission of malfeasance. The weight of his words settles like a shroud, a reminder that the constitution has been trampled, its principles cast aside like so much discarded trash.\n\nA disregard for the rule of law had been sown long before the ashes of the Twin Towers had cooled. The seeds of a vendetta had been planted, nurtured by the memories of a father's failed ambitions. Young Bush's eyes burned with a fire of vengeance, a desire to settle old scores and expand the reach of American power. The lure of oil, a siren's song, beckoned him forward, a promise of riches and control.\n\nTime has worn away the façade, revealing the abyss of our actions. The country teeters on the brink, a fragile balance between order and chaos. The specter of civil war looms, a specter that haunts the dreams of those who would seek to withdraw. And yet, the alternative, a coalition of nations, offers little solace. The Iraqi Parliament falters, a ship without rudder or anchor, adrift in a sea of uncertainty.\n\nThe interim government, a fragile edifice, crumbles beneath the weight of its own ineffectiveness. The Prime Minister's grasp is tenuous at best, his control a mere illusion. The radical elements, a hydra-headed beast, continue to stir, their influence spreading like a stain. The very fabric of the state is fraying, a tapestry rent asunder by the conflicting threads of power and ambition.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of articulating a solution, but of acknowledging the depths of our transgression. The hubris of our actions has left us lost, wandering in a wilderness of our own making. The ghosts of our past haunt us still, a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that the price of our recklessness will be paid in full.",
            "In the desolate vastness of our collective consciousness, a war rages on, a conflict that has consumed the minds of nations, leaving only ash and desolation in its wake. The War in Iraq, a specter that haunts our discourse, a maelstrom of conflicting ideologies and motivations. I find myself lost in the labyrinthine corridors of my own thoughts, struggling to articulate a coherent stance, a thread of conviction amidst the tangled web of uncertainty.\n\nIt is said that the war was born of a desire for vengeance, a tit-for-tat response to the wounds inflicted upon us on that fateful day, September 11th. Yet, as the years have passed, the reasons for our presence have become increasingly obscure, a blurred tapestry of competing interests and ideologies. We speak of democracy, of freedom, of the noble pursuit of oil, but the truth is, the war has become a protracted, Sisyphean endeavor, a futile effort to impose our will upon a people who have been forever changed by our actions.\n\nAs I ponder the complexities of this conflict, I am reminded of the Vietnam War, a declared war that became an undeclared quagmire, a war without purpose or end. Would we not repeat the same mistakes, perpetuating a cycle of violence and mistrust, as we try to shape the Iraqi people in our image? The ghosts of history whisper caution, warning us of the perils of cultural imperialism, of the folly of attempting to impose our values upon a people who have their own distinct narrative, their own struggles and triumphs.\n\nAnd yet, as I reflect on the faces of the soldiers who have been sent to fight this war, the families who have been torn apart by its ravages, I am torn asunder by conflicting emotions. I want to see them return home, to know that their loved ones are safe, but I fear that our continued presence only perpetuates the cycle of violence, that we are sowing the seeds of hatred and resentment, which will one day bear fruit in the form of a generation of Iraqis who will forever be wary of our intentions.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, a sense of disillusionment and frustration that threatens to consume me whole. The war in Iraq is a Gordian knot, a puzzle that refuses to yield its secrets, a labyrinth from which there is no escape. I can only offer this: that we must extricate ourselves from this quagmire, that we must find a way to withdraw, to allow the Iraqis to forge their own path, to chart their own destiny, free from the weight of our interference.",
            "The notion of a state imposing its will upon the sacred is a grievous affront to the very fabric of our democracy. It is a perversion of the constitution, a document etched in stone with the principles of freedom and the separation of church and state. To seek to enshrine in law the dictates of one faith over another is to invite the demons of intolerance and oppression.\n\nThe constitution's clear and unambiguous language speaks to the freedom of worship, unencumbered by the heavy hand of government. To tamper with this sacred text, to seek to amend it according to the whims of a particular faith, is to betray the trust of the founders and to invite chaos and strife. It is a proposition that reeks of hubris and a disregard for the diversity of our great nation.\n\nThose who would seek to impose their will upon the churches, to dictate what is and is not permissible, do so at their own peril. They reveal themselves to be advocates of a narrow and exclusivist creed, one that seeks to strangle the very life from the body of our republic. The people, not the government, must decide what is and is not acceptable in the realm of faith. To suggest otherwise is to invite the very tyranny they claim to abhor.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our democracy, a bulwark against the encroachment of theocracy and the restriction of individual liberty. To tamper with this fundamental principle is to risk the very foundations of our society. It is a proposition that would enshrine the interests of the powerful over the rights of the marginalized, and would perpetuate the very intolerance it claims to eradicate.\n\nThe motivations behind this proposed amendment are suspect, driven as they are by personal conviction rather than a genuine concern for the common good. The president's advocacy for this measure reeks of a zealotry that is at odds with the principles of our republic. His actions are a testament to the dangers of unchecked power and the corrupting influence of personal faith.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the government to decide what is and is not acceptable in the realm of faith. It is for the people, in their wisdom and diversity, to determine what is just and what is not. To seek to impose one's will upon the churches is to invite the very darkness that our constitution was meant to vanquish. We must resist this perversion of our democracy, and uphold the sacred principles of freedom and tolerance that have made our nation great.",
            "The war in Iraq - a conflict born of deception and fueled by hubris. It began with a foundation of uncertainty, a shroud of dishonesty cast over the American people by their government. The reasons for invasion, a tenuous web of connections to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, were spun with a deftness that belied the truth. The wound of 9/11 still fresh, the nation's outrage was exploited, and the invasion of Iraq became a fait accompli in 2003.\n\nAs one opposed to war, particularly the preemptive kind, I watched with a sense of foreboding as the conflict unfolded. The parallels between Iraq and Vietnam were stark, a repeat of past mistakes, and the lessons of history ignored. The toll in American lives was staggering, a testament to the futility of conflict, and the void left by the removal of a government was met with chaos.\n\nThe vaunted promise of implanting democracy in Iraq was a chimera, a dream born of idealism and a failure to grasp the complexities of the region. The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a haunting reminder of the perils of nation-building. The American government, woefully unprepared for the aftermath, stumbled blindly into the void, leaving a trail of destruction and death in its wake.\n\nThe removal of a government, a people's way of life, and the imposition of a new order - these are not tasks to be undertaken lightly. The US government, blinded by its own ambition, failed to plan for the consequences of its actions, and the people of Iraq paid the price. The insurgency, a hydra-like force, sprouted in the power vacuum, its tendrils entwining the very fabric of the country.\n\nThe reasons for invasion, a tissue of half-truths and misrepresentations, were slowly unraveled. The absence of WMDs, the duplicity of the government's justifications, and the selective application of force - all these served to erode the moral high ground upon which the war was fought. And through it all, the cries of \"it was for the oil\" hung in the air, a whispered truth that refused to be silenced.\n\nAs the years dragged on, the toll in American lives mounted, and the promise of a democratic Iraq receded further into the distance. The government's hubris, its failure to plan for the consequences of its actions, and its willingness to deceive the American people - all these served to undermine the war effort, leaving behind a legacy of blood and ashes.\n\nAnd so, as the conflict grinds on, we are left with the haunting question: at what cost? The answer, a distant hum in the darkness, whispers of a future where peace is a distant memory, and the ghosts of the past continue to haunt us still.",
            "The notion of gay marriage has long been a conviction of mine, a steadfast resolve that has driven my thoughts and feelings on the matter. It is a personal preference, one that defies the arbitrary boundaries of societal expectation and reduces to its most fundamental essence the very fabric of human experience. The sciences have increasingly revealed that the inclinations of the heart are not solely the product of environment, but rather a complex interplay of biology and genetics. To deny individuals the right to love and commit to one another based on factors beyond their control is an affront to the inherent dignity of the human condition.\n\nThe intrusion of politics into this most intimate of matters is an affront to the very notion of personal freedom. Marriage is a private pact, a bond forged between two individuals, and it is not for the state to dictate the terms of love and commitment. In my neighborhood, I've witnessed firsthand the quiet beauty of love, as gay couples walk hand in hand, their love as palpable as the sun on a summer's day. Yet, they are denied the simple recognition of marriage, a right afforded to all others, and it is a travesty.\n\nThe notion that a president, or any politician, can interpret the sacred institution of marriage as they see fit is a mockery of the very concept. It is a hubris that reduces the complexity of human experience to a simplistic, dogmatic framework. I've read and studied the scientific consensus, the mounting evidence that suggests our inclinations are not shaped by upbringing or environment, but are rooted in the very biology of our being.\n\nThe disparity between how society treats gay couples and heterosexual couples is stark. A man and a woman can flee to Vegas, marry in secret, and return home, their union unremarked upon, while a gay couple's love is subject to the scrutiny of the national spotlight. It is a cruel irony that a private act, a personal commitment, is thrust into the public domain, subject to the whims of politicians and moral absolutists.",
            "The desolate vastness of the internet, a forum for the thoughts and desires of the damned. When we release our words into this void, we invite the unforgiving gaze of the masses. It is a public domain, a place where the lines of privacy are blurred and the whispers of the individual are magnified. As a resident advisor, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this digital expanse. The careless words, the jests, the threats - all are laid bare for the world to see.\n\nThe repercussions are dire: a single misstep, a thoughtless post, and the fabric of perception is torn asunder. The very notion of anonymity is a farce, for the internet knows no bounds. It crawls into the crevices of our lives, seeping into the recesses of our souls. A friend, a Myspace connection, a Facebook acquaintance - all are potential conduits for the whispers of the wind. And when the winds of worry blow, the school is forced to act, lest the seeds of catastrophe be sown.\n\nBut how do we discern the seriousness of the threat? Can we trust the online jests of our peers, or do they mask a darker intent? The incident that befell our school serves as a stark reminder of the blurred lines between reality and the virtual world. A careless remark, a joke taken out of context, and the consequences are dire. The school's vigilance is not an invasion of privacy, but a necessary response to the uncertainty that pervades this digital age. When we choose to expose ourselves online, we relinquish our right to control the narrative.\n\nAnd yet, the boundaries remain, fragile and easily breached. The school officials' actions, though well-intentioned, walk a fine line between surveillance and invasion. The monitoring of phone conversations, texts, and IMs is a heavy burden, one that weighs heavily on the scales of freedom. The creation of a pseudonymous account, a friend request from a teacher, a peek into the private lives of students - all these raise questions about the nature of trust and the role of authority.\n\nThe internet is a double-edged sword, capable of both uniting and isolating us. As a resident advisor, I have come to realize that the digital realm is a labyrinth of contradictions, a place where the lines between public and private are constantly shifting. We must navigate this void with caution, ever mindful of the words we choose to release into the void. For in the end, it is not the technology that is to blame, but our own frailty, our own propensity for error.",
            "The war has worn on, a sputtering ember of a purpose that once flickered bright with promise. At its inception, the notion was to breathe life into a suffocating regime, to birth democracy from the ashes of tyranny. But time has seen the intention grow twisted, like a willow in the wind. We speak of a restoration of freedom, yet the truth lies mired in the muck of ulterior motives. The echoes of George Bush's elder whispers still linger, a shadow of a vendetta that may have been the spark that set this inferno ablaze.\n\nThe initial blaze of conviction has given way to a smoldering fire, a war of attrition that grinds on without purpose. The early days, a resolute declaration of our presence, a statement to the world of our unyielding resolve. But years have passed, and the flames have died down to a dull glow. We are left with a war that has lost its way, a conflict that has become a perpetual motion, a machine that chugs along without end or purpose.\n\nWe have poured our treasure into this desert, a river of gold that drains our own economy, leaving our own people to suffer. The weight of war bears down upon us, a crushing burden that threatens to break our backs. The money we spend on this foreign venture could be spent on the internal fires that rage within our own borders - poverty, neglect, the ravages of disease. Our own citizens cry out for help, their voices drowned out by the din of war.\n\nWe speak of victory, of a decisive end, but the truth is we have been defeated by our own doubts. We have lost sight of the purpose that once drove us, and now we are left to pick up the pieces of a shattered ideal. It is time to let go, to allow the people of this land to forge their own destiny. The war has dragged on long enough; it is time to bring our boys home.",
            "The question of whether the life of another can be spared by the vigilance of a stranger in the digital realm is a complex and troubling one. It is said that a person's online presence, a virtual shadow that follows them like a ghost, was discovered by someone who had the power to prevent a tragedy. This person, a guardian of sorts, had accessed a site where one's personal information is laid bare for all to see, and had intervened to spare a life.\n\nBut what of the nature of this information? Does it not belong to the individual who posts it, who knowingly commits it to the void of cyberspace? Is it not a surrender of one's private self, a deliberate act of exposure? And yet, once released, can it ever truly be taken back? The notion is disquieting, a specter that haunts the digital age.\n\nThe idea of a person, a sentinel of sorts, scouring the online profiles of students, searching for signs of danger, is a disturbing one. It smacks of a discriminatory impulse, a desire to micromanage the lives of others. And yet, in a world where the virtual and the real are increasingly intertwined, is this not a necessary evil? The line between surveillance and protection is a fine one, and it is a line that is constantly shifting.\n\nI must confess, I am uneasy about the ease with which information can be obtained online. A few clicks, a few keystrokes, and a stranger can know more about me than I care to share. It is a disquieting feeling, a sense of vulnerability that I do not wish to experience. And yet, I understand the utility of such sites, the connections they provide and the communities they foster.\n\nBut what of the responsibility that comes with this power? Can we truly know who is watching, who is searching for us in the digital shadows? My roommate's story of the school that banned Myspace is telling, a cautionary tale of the blurred lines between privacy and oversight. It is a question that haunts me still, a reminder of the fragile balance between freedom and control in the virtual world.",
            "The weight of hindsight settles heavy upon us, a crushing burden born of a war that was never meant to be. The Iraq War, a calamity of our making, a maelstrom of blood and rubble that refuses to subside. We speak of it now, a generation removed, and the words feel hollow, a faint echo of a catastrophe that has left its mark upon the world.\n\nI feel a certain unease in speaking out against the war, a sense of hypocrisy that clings to me like a shroud. For I was complicit, a part of the chorus that sang of its justification, even as the drums of war beat on. But the truth, like a cold wind, has blown through, revealing the emptiness of our claims. The polls, a testament to the world's collective wisdom, tell us that nearly eighty percent of humanity deemed the invasion a grave mistake. The Iraqis themselves, the very people we sought to liberate, cry out for our departure, a sentiment shared by a majority of their own troops. And the U.S. soldiers, weary and worn, their hearts heavy with the knowledge of a futile endeavor, whisper the same refrain.\n\nThis is a disaster, a quagmire that has been unfolding since the moment we set foot in that unforgiving land. The culture clash, a chasm so wide and deep, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the feeble attempts of our politicians to impose their will upon the people. Democracy, a concept born of our own ideals, is not theirs to claim, nor is it a gift to be bestowed upon them. The likes of Saddam, a tyrant to be sure, are replaced by an even greater evil, the evil of occupation, of desecration, of a people's way of life torn asunder.\n\nWe were warned, and we ignored the signs. The quicksand of history sucked us in, and now we are mired, unable to extricate ourselves. The administration's justifications, a litany of half-truths and misconceptions, ring hollow in the face of reality. I have yet to hear a persuasive argument for our continued presence in Iraq. The problems that would arise from our withdrawal, yes, but the reasons for our stay, a mere whisper of a justification, a mere shadow of a reason.\n\nPerhaps, if we were to leave gradually, a slow and painful withdrawal, it would be a more palatable solution. But to stay, to prolong the agony, to continue to bleed the life from that forsaken land? No, I do not see the sense in it. The Iraqis, those we sought to save, those we claimed to liberate, now tell us to leave, to depart, to cease our interference in their affairs. And we, the self-appointed saviors, the bringers of light to a dark land, are met with scorn and suspicion.\n\nWe are not the good guys, nor will we ever be. We are the architects of this disaster, the perpetrators of this crime. But to leave now, to acknowledge our folly, to confess our mistakes, this, perhaps, would be a small step towards redemption. It is a step that we have yet to take, a step that we may yet take, but for now, we stand frozen, mired in the quicksand of our own making.",
            "In the grand tapestry of American society, a subtle yet insidious thread of gender discrimination still weaves its way through the fabric of our existence. It is an issue that persists, a constant reminder of the battles yet to be won in our pursuit of equality. The struggle is not limited to women alone, though they bear the brunt of it, their progress hindered by the glass ceiling that still bars their ascent to positions of power. The weight of societal expectations, forged over centuries, holds them back, making it a rarity to find a man willing to submit to a woman's authority.\n\nThe workplace, a crucible of human endeavor, is not immune to this affliction. A woman, equipped with the necessary qualifications, yet finds herself overlooked for a promotion, her male colleagues unwilling to accept her as a leader. The reasons are manifold, rooted in the ingrained prejudices of a bygone era. And it is not just women who suffer; men, too, are trapped in the prison of societal norms. The stay-at-home father, once an anomaly, is now becoming more accepted, his decision to prioritize family over career met with a mixture of curiosity and disdain.\n\nIn the rarefied world of fashion, a similar dynamic plays out. The male who dares to enter this realm is often viewed with skepticism, his motivations questioned, his expertise doubted. It is a cruel irony that a man's style, once a badge of confidence, now raises eyebrows, his qualifications dismissed as superficial. The industry is not unique in this regard; in every field, there are those who will resist change, clinging to the familiar, even as the world around them evolves.\n\nThe pace of progress is glacial, a testament to the entrenched nature of these biases. Yet, there are signs of hope. Women are ascending to positions of power, their abilities recognized, their leadership accepted. The stay-at-home father, once seen as an aberration, is becoming the norm. And in the fashion world, men are beginning to be taken seriously, their opinions valued, their expertise respected.\n\nBut change is a fragile thing, easily lost if forced upon society too quickly. It must be nurtured, coaxed forth, like a wildflower blooming in the desert. The qualities of those who are stereotyped must be promoted, their strengths highlighted, their achievements celebrated. And it is not just a matter of promoting individual successes; it is a matter of changing the very fabric of our society, of unraveling the threads of prejudice that have held us back for so long.\n\nIn this slow, arduous process, there are many who will resist, clinging to the familiar, the comfortable. But we must press on, our efforts sustained by the knowledge that, eventually, the tide will turn. The world will come to recognize the value of the stay-at-home father, the contributions of the fashion-conscious man, and the leadership of the woman, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectations.\n\nIn the end, it is not just a matter of individual struggle, but a collective effort to create a society where everyone is valued, where every individual has the opportunity to reach their full potential, unencumbered by the shackles of prejudice and bias. It is a lofty goal, one that will take time, patience, and perseverance, but it is a goal worth striving for, a world where every individual can live without the burden of societal expectations, free to be themselves, to pursue their dreams, and to thrive.",
            "Decriminalization, a notion that has gradually seeped into the fabric of our society, a shift from the rigid laws of yore to a more lenient, almost dismissive stance.  The consequences, once dire and far-reaching, now bear a resemblance to a trivial traffic infraction, a blemish on one's record, but a stain nonetheless.  The specter of arrest, imprisonment, and the trappings of the justice system now recede into the background, a distant memory, as the weight of a citation takes its place.\n\nBut this is not without its repercussions.  The future, a labyrinth of uncertainty, still holds its terrors, the specter of job interviews, the whispered queries of a past that refuses to stay buried.  The decriminalization of marijuana, a respite from the weight of the law, does not necessarily erase the shadows that follow.  And yet, there are those who argue that the costs of prosecuting, of jailing, of housing and then releasing, are prohibitive, a drain on resources better spent elsewhere.\n\nIn municipalities beleaguered by fiscal woes, the philosophy of expediency often prevails.  The allure of freed-up funds, a siren's call to a brighter future, proves too great to resist.  In places like Denver, where the winds of progress blow strong, the tide of opinion has shifted, and the once-taboo now finds itself on the cusp of acceptance.\n\nBut there are those who would caution against a wholesale legalization, a fear that the norm of moderation will give way to a free-for-all, a plague of pot-smoking wafting through the streets like a malignant fog.  The specter of impaired driving, a threat to public safety, is a concern that cannot be ignored.  And yet, the line between prohibition and permissiveness is a thin one, a tightrope walked by those who would navigate the complex landscape of substance use.\n\nThe fact remains, no two individuals react in the same way to the same substance.  Some, like the tempestuous sea, are tossed about by the waves of their own making, while others, like the still waters of a forgotten lake, seem impervious to the whims of fate.  And so, we are left with the inescapable truth that substances, like human nature itself, are a mystery, a labyrinth of contradictions, and the line between progress and perdition is often blurred beyond recognition.",
            "The tedium of tradition weighs heavy on the soul. They cling to the familiar, the tried and the true, as if the passage of time held no sway over the rituals they hold dear. And yet, in their rigidity, they forget the value of flexibility, of yielding to the whispers of a changing world.\n\nThe Church, a bastion of unyielding doctrine, stands sentinel, unyielding in its expectations. Those who fail to conform to its strictures are cast aside, deemed unworthy of its acceptance. The teachings of love and compassion, once a beacon of hope, now ring hollow in the face of intolerance. For in the end, it is not the imperfect who are rejected, but those who dare to differ.\n\nI recall the tale of my parents, forbidden to wed in the very institution that claimed to spread love and acceptance. My father, a man of Episcopalian faith, could not be joined to my mother, a woman of Catholic conviction, for the sake of his differing creed. Such is the nature of a faith that elevates dogma over compassion.\n\nThe disconnect between doctrine and practice is a chasm that yawns wide, a void that cannot be bridged by empty words. We are taught to love our neighbors, to extend a hand to those in need, yet we are denied the very thing that would bring us closer to our fellow man. The outdated, the rigid, and the unyielding – such are the hallmarks of a faith that would rather cling to the past than adapt to the present.\n\nAnd so, I pose the question: would allowing priests to marry eradicate the scourge of pedophilia that plagues the Church? I think not. The depravity that drives such acts is not a product of marital status, but of a darkness that resides within the human heart. To believe otherwise is to reveal a naivety that is both tragic and telling.",
            "The morass of morality, a tangled skein that entwines the sacred and the profane, beckons me, a siren's call to clarity, which I dare not answer. The waters of conscience, a churning sea, swirl with the undertow of conviction, and I, a humble observer, am drawn beneath its surface.\n\nTo separate the church from the state, a distinction so finely drawn, yet so fraught with peril, is a task akin to navigating a treacherous shoal. The definable waters of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil union to others, threaten to capsize the ship of reason, sending the unwary to the depths.\n\nThe union of two people, a bond that transcends the mundane, is not for the state to define. Let us not confuse the sacred with the secular, lest we invite the very chaos we seek to avoid. The government, a behemoth of bureaucracy, should not concern itself with the sacramental aspects of matrimony, lest it imperil the delicate balance between the church and the state.\n\nThe question of gay marriage, a tempest in a teapot, should not be reduced to a constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, reserved for the weightiest of matters. It is a trifling concern, a mere flutter in the dovecote of debate, not worthy of the sacred parchment that is our constitution.\n\nLet the states, those bastions of autonomy, find their own path, their own reasoning, and if the winds of change blow strong enough, let them be carried to the federal level. But to amend the constitution, a document hallowed by the blood of our forefathers, for such a trifling matter, is an affront to the very principles it enshrines.\n\nNo, let us not sully the constitution with the petty squabbles of the righteous, but rather let us navigate the turbulent waters of morality with a steady hand, ever mindful of the perils that lie beneath the surface.",
            "The gray expanse of my upbringing, a Christian home where certainties were forged like tempered steel, left me with a lingering unease when it came to the matter of homosexuality. The friendships I've formed with individuals who walk this path have only served to deepen the complexity of my perspective. I do not pretend to fully comprehend the intricacies of this lifestyle, nor do I think it necessary to concur with it. Yet, I am persuaded that the institution of marriage should be a choice left to the individuals, not decreed by some distant authority.\n\nThe notion that the federal government should dictate the legal status of same-sex unions strikes me as an affront to the democratic principles that govern our land. The disparate ideologies of our states - some liberal, others conservative - should be allowed to flourish, or wither, as each sees fit. Does not the freedom to choose one's own destiny include the freedom to decide how to live in harmony with others? I do not believe the President, or any single individual, has the right to impose their will upon the nation, particularly when it comes to the most intimate aspects of our lives.\n\nIt is the individual states, with their unique character and values, that should be entrusted with the decision to recognize the rights of same-sex couples. This is not a matter of federal intervention, but rather a local affair, subject to the whims of the people who live there. And when a state chooses to legalize same-sex marriage, it is not for outsiders to dispute their decision, but rather for us to respect the will of those who have chosen to reside within their borders.\n\nAs for the President's stance on this matter, I find it a curious thing that one man, no matter how powerful, should presume to dictate the laws of an entire nation. His tenure is limited, a fleeting moment in the annals of time, and what is left behind is a legacy of decisions, some of which may prove wise, others not so much. Let us not forget that the true authority lies with the people, and not with any single individual, no matter how high their station.",
            "The notion of Myspace as a public domain eludes me not. It is a platform where the boundaries between private and public are blurred, where the lines are constantly shifting like the sands of the desert. The idea that one's thoughts and actions are private is a misguided notion, a relic of a bygone era. Once something is posted on the internet, it is akin to a stone cast into a still pond, rippling outward, touching every shore, every soul. The notion that a school official's intrusion into the private lives of students is an invasion of their rights is a tired argument, one that crumbles beneath the weight of reason.\n\nConsider this: if a student posts something on Myspace, they are, in effect, casting that stone into the pond. They are broadcasting their thoughts, their feelings, their very essence to the world. And in doing so, they are relinquishing any expectation of privacy. The school officials, like the ripples on the pond, can detect the disturbance, the tremors that emanate from that stone. They can sense the mood of the student body, the undercurrents of discontent or despair. And in doing so, they can take steps to prevent the calamities that can arise from such turmoil.\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher of mine, one who spoke of the importance of vigilance in the face of potential threats. \"We must ensure the safety of our students,\" they said, \"at all costs.\" And I agreed. The lockdown drills, the drills for terrorist attacks, the measures taken to prevent the unthinkable from happening - all of these are a testament to the school's commitment to safety. And so, I ask you, is it not reasonable for school officials to take similar measures to prevent the very real threat of school shootings? Is it not their duty to do so, to safeguard the lives of their students?\n\nThe notion that they were overstepping their bounds is a misinterpretation of their actions. They were not snooping for the sake of snooping; they were acting to prevent harm, to save lives. And in doing so, they were doing their job. The internet has made us all public figures, our actions and words broadcast to the world for all to see. And in this world, the school officials were merely doing their part to ensure that the ripples of our actions do not spread far enough to cause harm.",
            "The memory of that day still sears itself into my mind like a branding iron, a fire that refuses to be extinguished. I was swept up in the fervor, convinced that our response to the devastation of nine eleven would be a righteous crusade, a just retribution for the unspeakable horrors inflicted upon our own soil. But as I looked deeper, I began to see the cracks in the façade, the fissures that would eventually shatter our resolve.\n\nIt was a war born of passion, not reason. We charged forward with little regard for the long game, our actions driven by a hunger for vengeance rather than a clear-eyed understanding of the landscape we sought to alter. The enemy, a people with a culture as old as the earth itself, was reduced to a one-dimensional concept, a monolith of savagery that we sought to vanquish.\n\nBut we were blind to the reality of their world, a world where war was not a distant abstraction, but a lived experience, a way of life. We charged in, guns blazing, with no plan, no understanding, and no expectation of the consequences. And in that chaos, we lost ourselves, our purpose, and our way.\n\nI have come to realize that we were not the liberators we thought ourselves to be, but rather the aggressors, imposing our will upon a people who would rather fight among themselves than submit to our benevolence. The war was a manifestation of our own fears, our own insecurities, and our own frailty. We sought to impose order on a world that was not ours to order.\n\nIn the end, I am left with a sense of disillusionment, a feeling that we were never meant to win, that we were never meant to change them. They are a people with a history as long as the desert sands, and we are but a fleeting moment, a momentary blip on the radar of time. Our presence only serves to prolong their suffering, to prolong our own.\n\nI do not know what the future holds, but I know that our presence in their land is a double-edged sword, a sword that cuts both ways. We may have made progress, but it is progress that is fragile, fleeting, and ultimately, unsustainable. We cannot stay forever, and when we leave, the void we created will be filled with the dust of centuries, and the cycle will begin anew.\n\nI am left with a sense of resignation, a sense that we are not the saviors we thought ourselves to be, but rather the authors of our own undoing. We must leave, not because we have accomplished our goals, but because we have lost ourselves in the process. We must leave, not because we have created a new world, but because we have created a new reality, a reality that is as fragile as the sandcastles we build on the shifting dunes of time."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church stands at a precipice, its foundation shaken by the tides of time. Its once unwavering stance on the matters of the soul now seems anachronistic to the masses. The weight of tradition bears down upon it, yet it is a weight that may be its own undoing. The Church's rigid views on matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control have spawned a division within its ranks, a chasm that threatens to swallow its very essence.\n\nThe Church's views, though rooted in the depths of history, seem to belong to a bygone era. In an age of enlightenment and progress, its stance on these issues can only be seen as a relic of a bygone time. The Church's inflexibility has alienated many, causing them to turn away from the institution that once held such sway over their lives.\n\nThe notion that the Church's stance on these issues is a major contributor to its waning influence is not a conjecture, but a fact. Those who hold dear the values of compassion and inclusivity find themselves at odds with the Church's stance on these matters. For those who believe in the sanctity of life, the Church's opposition to abortion is a non-negotiable aspect of its doctrine. Yet, for those who believe in the right to choose, the Church's stance is a barrier that separates them from the very institution they once called their own.\n\nSimilarly, the Church's views on same-sex marriage have driven a wedge between it and its followers. The denial of the sacrament of marriage to those who love one another regardless of their sex is a wound that will not easily heal. The Church's refusal to acknowledge the humanity of those who identify as LGBTQ+ has led to a crisis of faith, a crisis that threatens to upend the very foundations of the institution.\n\nThe question remains: can the Church adapt to the changing tides of time? Can it find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the needs of a modern world? Or will it remain mired in the quicksand of its own making, a relic of a bygone era that refuses to evolve? The answer, much like the future, is uncertain.\n\nAs for the issue of female priests and married clergy, it is a debate that rages on. The Church's stance on these matters may seem anachronistic, but it is a stance that is rooted in its own history and tradition. Yet, one cannot help but wonder: would a more inclusive Church, one that allows for the ordination of women and the marriage of its clergy, be a Church that is more in tune with the needs of its followers? Or would it be a Church that has sacrificed its very essence in the name of progress?\n\nThe truth is, we may never know. But one thing is certain: the Catholic Church stands at a crossroads, a crossroads that will determine its future. Will it continue down the path of tradition, or will it embark on a new journey, one that is guided by the principles of compassion and inclusivity? The choice is not an easy one, but it is a choice that must be made if the Church is to survive in a world that is rapidly changing.",
            "In a world beset by the weight of unyielding certainties, I find myself drawn to a position of quiet conviction. The issue of gay marriage, a topic oft shrouded in controversy, has long been the subject of debate. My own stance on the matter is clear: I do not believe that a person's sexual orientation is a choice to be made, or a decision to be taken lightly. The notion that one can choose to be gay, or straight, is a notion that strikes me as a cruel misapprehension. It is a cruel fate to be born with an inescapable truth, only to be met with scorn and derision by those who claim to be the guardians of societal norms.\n\nTo suggest that a man and a woman may wed, while a union between two individuals of the same sex is deemed taboo, is a stark reminder of the hypocrisies that plague our society. It is a doctrine that I do not subscribe to, for it smacks of a rigid moral framework that seeks to dictate the terms of love and devotion. The idea that the federal government should intervene in such matters is a farce, a pretension that seeks to impose its will upon the lives of individuals who are merely seeking to live their truth.\n\nIn an era marked by complexity and nuance, we would do well to remember that the human experience is a labyrinth of contradictions. It is a tapestry woven from threads of love, desire, and acceptance. To reduce the lives of gay individuals to a simplistic calculus of right and wrong is to do them a grave injustice. They are not actors in a grand play, choosing their roles with deliberation and forethought. They are, quite simply, human beings, deserving of the same dignity and respect as any other.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the federal government to decide who may love, and who may not. It is not for us to impose our will upon the lives of others, to dictate the terms of their existence. The only truth that matters is the one that arises from the depths of the human heart, where love knows no bounds, and acceptance is the only currency that truly matters.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of human relationships, a solitary question hangs like a specter: what is the nature of love? Is it a flame that flickers between two souls, or a cold calculus of law and custom? We speak of gay marriage as if it were a foreign entity, a thing apart from the norm. But what is the norm? Is it a set of rigid expectations, a straitjacket of conventional wisdom? Or is it the messy, beautiful chaos of human connection?\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family is a tired refrain, a refrain that echoes through the halls of history. But what of the countless studies that have shown the similarities between gay and straight relationships? The same factors contribute to satisfaction, the same rates of success. Is it not the same thing, then? A bond between two people, forged in the fire of love and commitment?\n\nAnd yet, we are told that this bond is not enough. That the union of two consenting adults is somehow tainted by the absence of a church-sanctioned ritual. But what of the marriage certificate, that sterile document of state and law? Is it not the same thing, in the end, as a union of love and commitment? To deny it is to deny the very fabric of human relationship.\n\nWe speak of segregation, of separate but equal. But what of the inherent inequality of a system that denies recognition to one group, while granting it to another? Is it not a form of institutionalized prejudice, a reminder that our society is built on a foundation of exclusion and fear?\n\nAnd what of the children, those tiny, vulnerable things that we claim to care about? Do they not deserve the same love and protection, regardless of their parents' orientation? Is it not our duty to create a world where they can grow and thrive, free from the shadows of prejudice and fear?\n\nThe federal government, that great behemoth of bureaucracy and custom, has the power to shape our society. Let it use that power to create a world where love is not a privilege, but a right. Let it recognize the union of two consenting adults, regardless of their orientation. For in the end, it is not a question of morality or religion, but of humanity.\n\nWe are a nation of contradictions, a people torn between light and darkness. We speak of freedom and equality, while denying it to those who need it most. We claim to be a land of opportunity, while limiting the opportunities of those who are different. But we can do better. We can create a world where love is the only law, and where every human being is treated with dignity and respect.\n\nFor in the end, it is not about gay marriage, but about the human condition. It is about our capacity for love, our capacity for compassion, and our capacity for understanding. Let us not be swayed by fear and prejudice, but by a desire for a better world, a world where every human being can live in peace and dignity.",
            "The sterile glow of the hospital pharmacy's fluorescent lights cast an unforgiving glare upon the summer's hazy heat. I've worked among the sterile rows of vials and syringes, the soft beeps of machinery a constant heartbeat in the background. It's there, amidst the sterile quiet, that I've come to realize the truth: the line between licit and illicit is a blurred one. The efficacy of a substance is not determined by its legality, but by its utility. I've seen it in the controlled substances we dispense daily - oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet. They're the unsung heroes of the pharmaceutical world, their benefits undeniable.\n\nBut marijuana, that most maligned of substances, is bound by the shackles of taboo. We're reluctant to acknowledge its potential, to consider the possibility that its benefits might outweigh its drawbacks. It's a notion that's as futile as it is foolish. We've seen the devastation wrought by the demonization of substances like heroin and cocaine. Why, then, do we cling to this myth of marijuana as a menace? The truth is, it's not so different from the vices we already permit. It's a substance, nothing more, nothing less. Its risks, its benefits - they're not inherent to its legality, but to its use.\n\nThe notion that gradual legalization is the key to responsible use is a fragile reed to cling to. It's a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. The first step is to strip away the shroud of stigma that surrounds marijuana. Only then can we begin to see it for what it is: a tool, a substance that can be wielded for good or ill. We'd do well to remember that the line between use and abuse is a thin one, and that the demonization of a substance only serves to drive it further into the shadows. It's time to confront the truth: marijuana is not the devil we've made it out to be. It's a substance with benefits, and it's high time we acknowledge it.",
            "The church, like all things, has been reshaped by the tempests of time. Its stony facade, once a bastion of tradition, now wears a more supple countenance, one that bends to accommodate the whims of the modern world. Gone are the days of Sunday finery, when the faithful donned their finest attire to pay homage to the sacred. Now, the faithful gather in a more subdued, yet no less fervent, assembly. The masses, once a solemn affair, have been truncated to a mere thirty minutes, a concession to the brevity of our attention spans.\n\nAs I look back on my own experiences, I am struck by the manner in which the church has adapted to the changing tides of society. The once-revered Sunday ritual, where I would don my finest dress and shoes, has given way to a more relaxed, even casual, atmosphere. The summer months bring a particularly stark contrast, with beachwear a common sight among the congregation. Even the morning masses, once a time for solemn reflection, now see the faithful arrayed in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the formal attire of yesteryear.\n\nBut these changes, while notable, are but a pale reflection of the deeper concerns that beset the church. The allegations of pedophilia, a scourge that has tarnished the institution's good name, are a more profound issue. Some might suggest that a more relaxed, even progressive, approach – such as the ordination of women or the marriage of priests – might have prevented these atrocities. I disagree. The roots of such depravity run deeper, to the very marrow of human nature. Men, married or unmarried, are capable of unspeakable cruelty. It is not the institution that breeds such monsters, but the darkness that lies within.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the inclinations of such individuals are rooted in their very essence, a product of genetics rather than environment. We are born with our inclinations, and no societal strictures can alter the fundamental nature of our being. Marriage, or the lack thereof, is but a mere societal construct, a thin veneer that cannot mask the underlying truths of human nature. The church, in its attempts to prevent such abuses, must look to its own ranks, and consider the failings of its own members. For it is not the institution that is flawed, but the individuals who call themselves its servants.\n\nIn conclusion, I am left with a sense of detachment, a feeling that the church's efforts to adapt to the changing world are but a palliative measure, a soothing balm that does little to address the deeper wounds that afflict it. The church must look inward, to its own heart, and confront the darkness that lurks within its own bosom. Only then can it hope to emerge, scarred but redeemed, into the light of a new dawn.",
            "The memory of that fateful day still lingers, a wound that refuses to heal. The echoes of September 11th still resound, a clarion call to recklessness and hubris. We descended upon Iraq, a pretext born of desperation, a justification conjured from the ether. The Bush administration wove a tapestry of deceit, linking Saddam Hussein to the architects of terror, and the specter of WMDs cast a shadow over the land. But the threads of truth were soon to fray, exposing the frayed edges of a lie.\n\nIt was a sleight of hand, a conjurer's trick played upon the American people. Colin Powell, once a stalwart champion of the administration's cause, now confesses to doubt, his voice a whispered admission of malfeasance. The weight of his words settles like a shroud, a reminder that the constitution has been trampled, its principles cast aside like so much discarded trash.\n\nA disregard for the rule of law had been sown long before the ashes of the Twin Towers had cooled. The seeds of a vendetta had been planted, nurtured by the memories of a father's failed ambitions. Young Bush's eyes burned with a fire of vengeance, a desire to settle old scores and expand the reach of American power. The lure of oil, a siren's song, beckoned him forward, a promise of riches and control.\n\nTime has worn away the façade, revealing the abyss of our actions. The country teeters on the brink, a fragile balance between order and chaos. The specter of civil war looms, a specter that haunts the dreams of those who would seek to withdraw. And yet, the alternative, a coalition of nations, offers little solace. The Iraqi Parliament falters, a ship without rudder or anchor, adrift in a sea of uncertainty.\n\nThe interim government, a fragile edifice, crumbles beneath the weight of its own ineffectiveness. The Prime Minister's grasp is tenuous at best, his control a mere illusion. The radical elements, a hydra-headed beast, continue to stir, their influence spreading like a stain. The very fabric of the state is fraying, a tapestry rent asunder by the conflicting threads of power and ambition.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of articulating a solution, but of acknowledging the depths of our transgression. The hubris of our actions has left us lost, wandering in a wilderness of our own making. The ghosts of our past haunt us still, a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that the price of our recklessness will be paid in full.",
            "In the desolate vastness of our collective consciousness, a war rages on, a conflict that has consumed the minds of nations, leaving only ash and desolation in its wake. The War in Iraq, a specter that haunts our discourse, a maelstrom of conflicting ideologies and motivations. I find myself lost in the labyrinthine corridors of my own thoughts, struggling to articulate a coherent stance, a thread of conviction amidst the tangled web of uncertainty.\n\nIt is said that the war was born of a desire for vengeance, a tit-for-tat response to the wounds inflicted upon us on that fateful day, September 11th. Yet, as the years have passed, the reasons for our presence have become increasingly obscure, a blurred tapestry of competing interests and ideologies. We speak of democracy, of freedom, of the noble pursuit of oil, but the truth is, the war has become a protracted, Sisyphean endeavor, a futile effort to impose our will upon a people who have been forever changed by our actions.\n\nAs I ponder the complexities of this conflict, I am reminded of the Vietnam War, a declared war that became an undeclared quagmire, a war without purpose or end. Would we not repeat the same mistakes, perpetuating a cycle of violence and mistrust, as we try to shape the Iraqi people in our image? The ghosts of history whisper caution, warning us of the perils of cultural imperialism, of the folly of attempting to impose our values upon a people who have their own distinct narrative, their own struggles and triumphs.\n\nAnd yet, as I reflect on the faces of the soldiers who have been sent to fight this war, the families who have been torn apart by its ravages, I am torn asunder by conflicting emotions. I want to see them return home, to know that their loved ones are safe, but I fear that our continued presence only perpetuates the cycle of violence, that we are sowing the seeds of hatred and resentment, which will one day bear fruit in the form of a generation of Iraqis who will forever be wary of our intentions.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, a sense of disillusionment and frustration that threatens to consume me whole. The war in Iraq is a Gordian knot, a puzzle that refuses to yield its secrets, a labyrinth from which there is no escape. I can only offer this: that we must extricate ourselves from this quagmire, that we must find a way to withdraw, to allow the Iraqis to forge their own path, to chart their own destiny, free from the weight of our interference.",
            "The notion of a state imposing its will upon the sacred is a grievous affront to the very fabric of our democracy. It is a perversion of the constitution, a document etched in stone with the principles of freedom and the separation of church and state. To seek to enshrine in law the dictates of one faith over another is to invite the demons of intolerance and oppression.\n\nThe constitution's clear and unambiguous language speaks to the freedom of worship, unencumbered by the heavy hand of government. To tamper with this sacred text, to seek to amend it according to the whims of a particular faith, is to betray the trust of the founders and to invite chaos and strife. It is a proposition that reeks of hubris and a disregard for the diversity of our great nation.\n\nThose who would seek to impose their will upon the churches, to dictate what is and is not permissible, do so at their own peril. They reveal themselves to be advocates of a narrow and exclusivist creed, one that seeks to strangle the very life from the body of our republic. The people, not the government, must decide what is and is not acceptable in the realm of faith. To suggest otherwise is to invite the very tyranny they claim to abhor.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our democracy, a bulwark against the encroachment of theocracy and the restriction of individual liberty. To tamper with this fundamental principle is to risk the very foundations of our society. It is a proposition that would enshrine the interests of the powerful over the rights of the marginalized, and would perpetuate the very intolerance it claims to eradicate.\n\nThe motivations behind this proposed amendment are suspect, driven as they are by personal conviction rather than a genuine concern for the common good. The president's advocacy for this measure reeks of a zealotry that is at odds with the principles of our republic. His actions are a testament to the dangers of unchecked power and the corrupting influence of personal faith.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the government to decide what is and is not acceptable in the realm of faith. It is for the people, in their wisdom and diversity, to determine what is just and what is not. To seek to impose one's will upon the churches is to invite the very darkness that our constitution was meant to vanquish. We must resist this perversion of our democracy, and uphold the sacred principles of freedom and tolerance that have made our nation great.",
            "The war in Iraq - a conflict born of deception and fueled by hubris. It began with a foundation of uncertainty, a shroud of dishonesty cast over the American people by their government. The reasons for invasion, a tenuous web of connections to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, were spun with a deftness that belied the truth. The wound of 9/11 still fresh, the nation's outrage was exploited, and the invasion of Iraq became a fait accompli in 2003.\n\nAs one opposed to war, particularly the preemptive kind, I watched with a sense of foreboding as the conflict unfolded. The parallels between Iraq and Vietnam were stark, a repeat of past mistakes, and the lessons of history ignored. The toll in American lives was staggering, a testament to the futility of conflict, and the void left by the removal of a government was met with chaos.\n\nThe vaunted promise of implanting democracy in Iraq was a chimera, a dream born of idealism and a failure to grasp the complexities of the region. The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a haunting reminder of the perils of nation-building. The American government, woefully unprepared for the aftermath, stumbled blindly into the void, leaving a trail of destruction and death in its wake.\n\nThe removal of a government, a people's way of life, and the imposition of a new order - these are not tasks to be undertaken lightly. The US government, blinded by its own ambition, failed to plan for the consequences of its actions, and the people of Iraq paid the price. The insurgency, a hydra-like force, sprouted in the power vacuum, its tendrils entwining the very fabric of the country.\n\nThe reasons for invasion, a tissue of half-truths and misrepresentations, were slowly unraveled. The absence of WMDs, the duplicity of the government's justifications, and the selective application of force - all these served to erode the moral high ground upon which the war was fought. And through it all, the cries of \"it was for the oil\" hung in the air, a whispered truth that refused to be silenced.\n\nAs the years dragged on, the toll in American lives mounted, and the promise of a democratic Iraq receded further into the distance. The government's hubris, its failure to plan for the consequences of its actions, and its willingness to deceive the American people - all these served to undermine the war effort, leaving behind a legacy of blood and ashes.\n\nAnd so, as the conflict grinds on, we are left with the haunting question: at what cost? The answer, a distant hum in the darkness, whispers of a future where peace is a distant memory, and the ghosts of the past continue to haunt us still.",
            "The notion of gay marriage has long been a conviction of mine, a steadfast resolve that has driven my thoughts and feelings on the matter. It is a personal preference, one that defies the arbitrary boundaries of societal expectation and reduces to its most fundamental essence the very fabric of human experience. The sciences have increasingly revealed that the inclinations of the heart are not solely the product of environment, but rather a complex interplay of biology and genetics. To deny individuals the right to love and commit to one another based on factors beyond their control is an affront to the inherent dignity of the human condition.\n\nThe intrusion of politics into this most intimate of matters is an affront to the very notion of personal freedom. Marriage is a private pact, a bond forged between two individuals, and it is not for the state to dictate the terms of love and commitment. In my neighborhood, I've witnessed firsthand the quiet beauty of love, as gay couples walk hand in hand, their love as palpable as the sun on a summer's day. Yet, they are denied the simple recognition of marriage, a right afforded to all others, and it is a travesty.\n\nThe notion that a president, or any politician, can interpret the sacred institution of marriage as they see fit is a mockery of the very concept. It is a hubris that reduces the complexity of human experience to a simplistic, dogmatic framework. I've read and studied the scientific consensus, the mounting evidence that suggests our inclinations are not shaped by upbringing or environment, but are rooted in the very biology of our being.\n\nThe disparity between how society treats gay couples and heterosexual couples is stark. A man and a woman can flee to Vegas, marry in secret, and return home, their union unremarked upon, while a gay couple's love is subject to the scrutiny of the national spotlight. It is a cruel irony that a private act, a personal commitment, is thrust into the public domain, subject to the whims of politicians and moral absolutists.",
            "The desolate vastness of the internet, a forum for the thoughts and desires of the damned. When we release our words into this void, we invite the unforgiving gaze of the masses. It is a public domain, a place where the lines of privacy are blurred and the whispers of the individual are magnified. As a resident advisor, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this digital expanse. The careless words, the jests, the threats - all are laid bare for the world to see.\n\nThe repercussions are dire: a single misstep, a thoughtless post, and the fabric of perception is torn asunder. The very notion of anonymity is a farce, for the internet knows no bounds. It crawls into the crevices of our lives, seeping into the recesses of our souls. A friend, a Myspace connection, a Facebook acquaintance - all are potential conduits for the whispers of the wind. And when the winds of worry blow, the school is forced to act, lest the seeds of catastrophe be sown.\n\nBut how do we discern the seriousness of the threat? Can we trust the online jests of our peers, or do they mask a darker intent? The incident that befell our school serves as a stark reminder of the blurred lines between reality and the virtual world. A careless remark, a joke taken out of context, and the consequences are dire. The school's vigilance is not an invasion of privacy, but a necessary response to the uncertainty that pervades this digital age. When we choose to expose ourselves online, we relinquish our right to control the narrative.\n\nAnd yet, the boundaries remain, fragile and easily breached. The school officials' actions, though well-intentioned, walk a fine line between surveillance and invasion. The monitoring of phone conversations, texts, and IMs is a heavy burden, one that weighs heavily on the scales of freedom. The creation of a pseudonymous account, a friend request from a teacher, a peek into the private lives of students - all these raise questions about the nature of trust and the role of authority.\n\nThe internet is a double-edged sword, capable of both uniting and isolating us. As a resident advisor, I have come to realize that the digital realm is a labyrinth of contradictions, a place where the lines between public and private are constantly shifting. We must navigate this void with caution, ever mindful of the words we choose to release into the void. For in the end, it is not the technology that is to blame, but our own frailty, our own propensity for error.",
            "The war has worn on, a sputtering ember of a purpose that once flickered bright with promise. At its inception, the notion was to breathe life into a suffocating regime, to birth democracy from the ashes of tyranny. But time has seen the intention grow twisted, like a willow in the wind. We speak of a restoration of freedom, yet the truth lies mired in the muck of ulterior motives. The echoes of George Bush's elder whispers still linger, a shadow of a vendetta that may have been the spark that set this inferno ablaze.\n\nThe initial blaze of conviction has given way to a smoldering fire, a war of attrition that grinds on without purpose. The early days, a resolute declaration of our presence, a statement to the world of our unyielding resolve. But years have passed, and the flames have died down to a dull glow. We are left with a war that has lost its way, a conflict that has become a perpetual motion, a machine that chugs along without end or purpose.\n\nWe have poured our treasure into this desert, a river of gold that drains our own economy, leaving our own people to suffer. The weight of war bears down upon us, a crushing burden that threatens to break our backs. The money we spend on this foreign venture could be spent on the internal fires that rage within our own borders - poverty, neglect, the ravages of disease. Our own citizens cry out for help, their voices drowned out by the din of war.\n\nWe speak of victory, of a decisive end, but the truth is we have been defeated by our own doubts. We have lost sight of the purpose that once drove us, and now we are left to pick up the pieces of a shattered ideal. It is time to let go, to allow the people of this land to forge their own destiny. The war has dragged on long enough; it is time to bring our boys home.",
            "The question of whether the life of another can be spared by the vigilance of a stranger in the digital realm is a complex and troubling one. It is said that a person's online presence, a virtual shadow that follows them like a ghost, was discovered by someone who had the power to prevent a tragedy. This person, a guardian of sorts, had accessed a site where one's personal information is laid bare for all to see, and had intervened to spare a life.\n\nBut what of the nature of this information? Does it not belong to the individual who posts it, who knowingly commits it to the void of cyberspace? Is it not a surrender of one's private self, a deliberate act of exposure? And yet, once released, can it ever truly be taken back? The notion is disquieting, a specter that haunts the digital age.\n\nThe idea of a person, a sentinel of sorts, scouring the online profiles of students, searching for signs of danger, is a disturbing one. It smacks of a discriminatory impulse, a desire to micromanage the lives of others. And yet, in a world where the virtual and the real are increasingly intertwined, is this not a necessary evil? The line between surveillance and protection is a fine one, and it is a line that is constantly shifting.\n\nI must confess, I am uneasy about the ease with which information can be obtained online. A few clicks, a few keystrokes, and a stranger can know more about me than I care to share. It is a disquieting feeling, a sense of vulnerability that I do not wish to experience. And yet, I understand the utility of such sites, the connections they provide and the communities they foster.\n\nBut what of the responsibility that comes with this power? Can we truly know who is watching, who is searching for us in the digital shadows? My roommate's story of the school that banned Myspace is telling, a cautionary tale of the blurred lines between privacy and oversight. It is a question that haunts me still, a reminder of the fragile balance between freedom and control in the virtual world.",
            "The weight of hindsight settles heavy upon us, a crushing burden born of a war that was never meant to be. The Iraq War, a calamity of our making, a maelstrom of blood and rubble that refuses to subside. We speak of it now, a generation removed, and the words feel hollow, a faint echo of a catastrophe that has left its mark upon the world.\n\nI feel a certain unease in speaking out against the war, a sense of hypocrisy that clings to me like a shroud. For I was complicit, a part of the chorus that sang of its justification, even as the drums of war beat on. But the truth, like a cold wind, has blown through, revealing the emptiness of our claims. The polls, a testament to the world's collective wisdom, tell us that nearly eighty percent of humanity deemed the invasion a grave mistake. The Iraqis themselves, the very people we sought to liberate, cry out for our departure, a sentiment shared by a majority of their own troops. And the U.S. soldiers, weary and worn, their hearts heavy with the knowledge of a futile endeavor, whisper the same refrain.\n\nThis is a disaster, a quagmire that has been unfolding since the moment we set foot in that unforgiving land. The culture clash, a chasm so wide and deep, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the feeble attempts of our politicians to impose their will upon the people. Democracy, a concept born of our own ideals, is not theirs to claim, nor is it a gift to be bestowed upon them. The likes of Saddam, a tyrant to be sure, are replaced by an even greater evil, the evil of occupation, of desecration, of a people's way of life torn asunder.\n\nWe were warned, and we ignored the signs. The quicksand of history sucked us in, and now we are mired, unable to extricate ourselves. The administration's justifications, a litany of half-truths and misconceptions, ring hollow in the face of reality. I have yet to hear a persuasive argument for our continued presence in Iraq. The problems that would arise from our withdrawal, yes, but the reasons for our stay, a mere whisper of a justification, a mere shadow of a reason.\n\nPerhaps, if we were to leave gradually, a slow and painful withdrawal, it would be a more palatable solution. But to stay, to prolong the agony, to continue to bleed the life from that forsaken land? No, I do not see the sense in it. The Iraqis, those we sought to save, those we claimed to liberate, now tell us to leave, to depart, to cease our interference in their affairs. And we, the self-appointed saviors, the bringers of light to a dark land, are met with scorn and suspicion.\n\nWe are not the good guys, nor will we ever be. We are the architects of this disaster, the perpetrators of this crime. But to leave now, to acknowledge our folly, to confess our mistakes, this, perhaps, would be a small step towards redemption. It is a step that we have yet to take, a step that we may yet take, but for now, we stand frozen, mired in the quicksand of our own making.",
            "In the grand tapestry of American society, a subtle yet insidious thread of gender discrimination still weaves its way through the fabric of our existence. It is an issue that persists, a constant reminder of the battles yet to be won in our pursuit of equality. The struggle is not limited to women alone, though they bear the brunt of it, their progress hindered by the glass ceiling that still bars their ascent to positions of power. The weight of societal expectations, forged over centuries, holds them back, making it a rarity to find a man willing to submit to a woman's authority.\n\nThe workplace, a crucible of human endeavor, is not immune to this affliction. A woman, equipped with the necessary qualifications, yet finds herself overlooked for a promotion, her male colleagues unwilling to accept her as a leader. The reasons are manifold, rooted in the ingrained prejudices of a bygone era. And it is not just women who suffer; men, too, are trapped in the prison of societal norms. The stay-at-home father, once an anomaly, is now becoming more accepted, his decision to prioritize family over career met with a mixture of curiosity and disdain.\n\nIn the rarefied world of fashion, a similar dynamic plays out. The male who dares to enter this realm is often viewed with skepticism, his motivations questioned, his expertise doubted. It is a cruel irony that a man's style, once a badge of confidence, now raises eyebrows, his qualifications dismissed as superficial. The industry is not unique in this regard; in every field, there are those who will resist change, clinging to the familiar, even as the world around them evolves.\n\nThe pace of progress is glacial, a testament to the entrenched nature of these biases. Yet, there are signs of hope. Women are ascending to positions of power, their abilities recognized, their leadership accepted. The stay-at-home father, once seen as an aberration, is becoming the norm. And in the fashion world, men are beginning to be taken seriously, their opinions valued, their expertise respected.\n\nBut change is a fragile thing, easily lost if forced upon society too quickly. It must be nurtured, coaxed forth, like a wildflower blooming in the desert. The qualities of those who are stereotyped must be promoted, their strengths highlighted, their achievements celebrated. And it is not just a matter of promoting individual successes; it is a matter of changing the very fabric of our society, of unraveling the threads of prejudice that have held us back for so long.\n\nIn this slow, arduous process, there are many who will resist, clinging to the familiar, the comfortable. But we must press on, our efforts sustained by the knowledge that, eventually, the tide will turn. The world will come to recognize the value of the stay-at-home father, the contributions of the fashion-conscious man, and the leadership of the woman, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectations.\n\nIn the end, it is not just a matter of individual struggle, but a collective effort to create a society where everyone is valued, where every individual has the opportunity to reach their full potential, unencumbered by the shackles of prejudice and bias. It is a lofty goal, one that will take time, patience, and perseverance, but it is a goal worth striving for, a world where every individual can live without the burden of societal expectations, free to be themselves, to pursue their dreams, and to thrive.",
            "Decriminalization, a notion that has gradually seeped into the fabric of our society, a shift from the rigid laws of yore to a more lenient, almost dismissive stance.  The consequences, once dire and far-reaching, now bear a resemblance to a trivial traffic infraction, a blemish on one's record, but a stain nonetheless.  The specter of arrest, imprisonment, and the trappings of the justice system now recede into the background, a distant memory, as the weight of a citation takes its place.\n\nBut this is not without its repercussions.  The future, a labyrinth of uncertainty, still holds its terrors, the specter of job interviews, the whispered queries of a past that refuses to stay buried.  The decriminalization of marijuana, a respite from the weight of the law, does not necessarily erase the shadows that follow.  And yet, there are those who argue that the costs of prosecuting, of jailing, of housing and then releasing, are prohibitive, a drain on resources better spent elsewhere.\n\nIn municipalities beleaguered by fiscal woes, the philosophy of expediency often prevails.  The allure of freed-up funds, a siren's call to a brighter future, proves too great to resist.  In places like Denver, where the winds of progress blow strong, the tide of opinion has shifted, and the once-taboo now finds itself on the cusp of acceptance.\n\nBut there are those who would caution against a wholesale legalization, a fear that the norm of moderation will give way to a free-for-all, a plague of pot-smoking wafting through the streets like a malignant fog.  The specter of impaired driving, a threat to public safety, is a concern that cannot be ignored.  And yet, the line between prohibition and permissiveness is a thin one, a tightrope walked by those who would navigate the complex landscape of substance use.\n\nThe fact remains, no two individuals react in the same way to the same substance.  Some, like the tempestuous sea, are tossed about by the waves of their own making, while others, like the still waters of a forgotten lake, seem impervious to the whims of fate.  And so, we are left with the inescapable truth that substances, like human nature itself, are a mystery, a labyrinth of contradictions, and the line between progress and perdition is often blurred beyond recognition.",
            "The tedium of tradition weighs heavy on the soul. They cling to the familiar, the tried and the true, as if the passage of time held no sway over the rituals they hold dear. And yet, in their rigidity, they forget the value of flexibility, of yielding to the whispers of a changing world.\n\nThe Church, a bastion of unyielding doctrine, stands sentinel, unyielding in its expectations. Those who fail to conform to its strictures are cast aside, deemed unworthy of its acceptance. The teachings of love and compassion, once a beacon of hope, now ring hollow in the face of intolerance. For in the end, it is not the imperfect who are rejected, but those who dare to differ.\n\nI recall the tale of my parents, forbidden to wed in the very institution that claimed to spread love and acceptance. My father, a man of Episcopalian faith, could not be joined to my mother, a woman of Catholic conviction, for the sake of his differing creed. Such is the nature of a faith that elevates dogma over compassion.\n\nThe disconnect between doctrine and practice is a chasm that yawns wide, a void that cannot be bridged by empty words. We are taught to love our neighbors, to extend a hand to those in need, yet we are denied the very thing that would bring us closer to our fellow man. The outdated, the rigid, and the unyielding – such are the hallmarks of a faith that would rather cling to the past than adapt to the present.\n\nAnd so, I pose the question: would allowing priests to marry eradicate the scourge of pedophilia that plagues the Church? I think not. The depravity that drives such acts is not a product of marital status, but of a darkness that resides within the human heart. To believe otherwise is to reveal a naivety that is both tragic and telling.",
            "The morass of morality, a tangled skein that entwines the sacred and the profane, beckons me, a siren's call to clarity, which I dare not answer. The waters of conscience, a churning sea, swirl with the undertow of conviction, and I, a humble observer, am drawn beneath its surface.\n\nTo separate the church from the state, a distinction so finely drawn, yet so fraught with peril, is a task akin to navigating a treacherous shoal. The definable waters of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil union to others, threaten to capsize the ship of reason, sending the unwary to the depths.\n\nThe union of two people, a bond that transcends the mundane, is not for the state to define. Let us not confuse the sacred with the secular, lest we invite the very chaos we seek to avoid. The government, a behemoth of bureaucracy, should not concern itself with the sacramental aspects of matrimony, lest it imperil the delicate balance between the church and the state.\n\nThe question of gay marriage, a tempest in a teapot, should not be reduced to a constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, reserved for the weightiest of matters. It is a trifling concern, a mere flutter in the dovecote of debate, not worthy of the sacred parchment that is our constitution.\n\nLet the states, those bastions of autonomy, find their own path, their own reasoning, and if the winds of change blow strong enough, let them be carried to the federal level. But to amend the constitution, a document hallowed by the blood of our forefathers, for such a trifling matter, is an affront to the very principles it enshrines.\n\nNo, let us not sully the constitution with the petty squabbles of the righteous, but rather let us navigate the turbulent waters of morality with a steady hand, ever mindful of the perils that lie beneath the surface.",
            "The gray expanse of my upbringing, a Christian home where certainties were forged like tempered steel, left me with a lingering unease when it came to the matter of homosexuality. The friendships I've formed with individuals who walk this path have only served to deepen the complexity of my perspective. I do not pretend to fully comprehend the intricacies of this lifestyle, nor do I think it necessary to concur with it. Yet, I am persuaded that the institution of marriage should be a choice left to the individuals, not decreed by some distant authority.\n\nThe notion that the federal government should dictate the legal status of same-sex unions strikes me as an affront to the democratic principles that govern our land. The disparate ideologies of our states - some liberal, others conservative - should be allowed to flourish, or wither, as each sees fit. Does not the freedom to choose one's own destiny include the freedom to decide how to live in harmony with others? I do not believe the President, or any single individual, has the right to impose their will upon the nation, particularly when it comes to the most intimate aspects of our lives.\n\nIt is the individual states, with their unique character and values, that should be entrusted with the decision to recognize the rights of same-sex couples. This is not a matter of federal intervention, but rather a local affair, subject to the whims of the people who live there. And when a state chooses to legalize same-sex marriage, it is not for outsiders to dispute their decision, but rather for us to respect the will of those who have chosen to reside within their borders.\n\nAs for the President's stance on this matter, I find it a curious thing that one man, no matter how powerful, should presume to dictate the laws of an entire nation. His tenure is limited, a fleeting moment in the annals of time, and what is left behind is a legacy of decisions, some of which may prove wise, others not so much. Let us not forget that the true authority lies with the people, and not with any single individual, no matter how high their station.",
            "The notion of Myspace as a public domain eludes me not. It is a platform where the boundaries between private and public are blurred, where the lines are constantly shifting like the sands of the desert. The idea that one's thoughts and actions are private is a misguided notion, a relic of a bygone era. Once something is posted on the internet, it is akin to a stone cast into a still pond, rippling outward, touching every shore, every soul. The notion that a school official's intrusion into the private lives of students is an invasion of their rights is a tired argument, one that crumbles beneath the weight of reason.\n\nConsider this: if a student posts something on Myspace, they are, in effect, casting that stone into the pond. They are broadcasting their thoughts, their feelings, their very essence to the world. And in doing so, they are relinquishing any expectation of privacy. The school officials, like the ripples on the pond, can detect the disturbance, the tremors that emanate from that stone. They can sense the mood of the student body, the undercurrents of discontent or despair. And in doing so, they can take steps to prevent the calamities that can arise from such turmoil.\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher of mine, one who spoke of the importance of vigilance in the face of potential threats. \"We must ensure the safety of our students,\" they said, \"at all costs.\" And I agreed. The lockdown drills, the drills for terrorist attacks, the measures taken to prevent the unthinkable from happening - all of these are a testament to the school's commitment to safety. And so, I ask you, is it not reasonable for school officials to take similar measures to prevent the very real threat of school shootings? Is it not their duty to do so, to safeguard the lives of their students?\n\nThe notion that they were overstepping their bounds is a misinterpretation of their actions. They were not snooping for the sake of snooping; they were acting to prevent harm, to save lives. And in doing so, they were doing their job. The internet has made us all public figures, our actions and words broadcast to the world for all to see. And in this world, the school officials were merely doing their part to ensure that the ripples of our actions do not spread far enough to cause harm.",
            "The memory of that day still sears itself into my mind like a branding iron, a fire that refuses to be extinguished. I was swept up in the fervor, convinced that our response to the devastation of nine eleven would be a righteous crusade, a just retribution for the unspeakable horrors inflicted upon our own soil. But as I looked deeper, I began to see the cracks in the façade, the fissures that would eventually shatter our resolve.\n\nIt was a war born of passion, not reason. We charged forward with little regard for the long game, our actions driven by a hunger for vengeance rather than a clear-eyed understanding of the landscape we sought to alter. The enemy, a people with a culture as old as the earth itself, was reduced to a one-dimensional concept, a monolith of savagery that we sought to vanquish.\n\nBut we were blind to the reality of their world, a world where war was not a distant abstraction, but a lived experience, a way of life. We charged in, guns blazing, with no plan, no understanding, and no expectation of the consequences. And in that chaos, we lost ourselves, our purpose, and our way.\n\nI have come to realize that we were not the liberators we thought ourselves to be, but rather the aggressors, imposing our will upon a people who would rather fight among themselves than submit to our benevolence. The war was a manifestation of our own fears, our own insecurities, and our own frailty. We sought to impose order on a world that was not ours to order.\n\nIn the end, I am left with a sense of disillusionment, a feeling that we were never meant to win, that we were never meant to change them. They are a people with a history as long as the desert sands, and we are but a fleeting moment, a momentary blip on the radar of time. Our presence only serves to prolong their suffering, to prolong our own.\n\nI do not know what the future holds, but I know that our presence in their land is a double-edged sword, a sword that cuts both ways. We may have made progress, but it is progress that is fragile, fleeting, and ultimately, unsustainable. We cannot stay forever, and when we leave, the void we created will be filled with the dust of centuries, and the cycle will begin anew.\n\nI am left with a sense of resignation, a sense that we are not the saviors we thought ourselves to be, but rather the authors of our own undoing. We must leave, not because we have accomplished our goals, but because we have lost ourselves in the process. We must leave, not because we have created a new world, but because we have created a new reality, a reality that is as fragile as the sandcastles we build on the shifting dunes of time."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

The Church's rigid views on matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control have spawned a division within its ranks, a chasm that threatens to swallow its very essence.\n\nThe Church's views, though rooted in the depths of history, seem to belong to a bygone era. In an age of enlightenment and progress, its stance on these issues can only be seen as a relic of a bygone time. The Church's inflexibility has alienated many, causing them to turn away from the institution that once held such sway over their lives.\n\nThe notion that the Church's stance on these issues is a major contributor to its waning influence is not a conjecture, but a fact. Those who hold dear the values of compassion and inclusivity find themselves at odds with the Church's stance on these matters. For those who believe in the sanctity of life, the Church's opposition to abortion is a non-negotiable aspect of its doctrine. Yet, for those who believe in the right to choose, the Church's stance is a barrier that separates them from the very institution they once called their own.\n\nSimilarly, the Church's views on same-sex marriage have driven a wedge between it and its followers. The denial of the sacrament of marriage to those who love one another regardless of their sex is a wound that will not easily heal. The Church's refusal to acknowledge the humanity of those who identify as LGBTQ+ has led to a crisis of faith, a crisis that threatens to upend the very foundations of the institution.\n\nThe question remains: can the Church adapt to the changing tides of time? Can it find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the needs of a modern world? Or will it remain mired in the quicksand of its own making, a relic of a bygone era that refuses to evolve? The answer, much like the future, is uncertain.\n\nAs for the issue of female priests and married clergy, it is a debate that rages on. The Church's stance on these matters may seem anachronistic, but it is a stance that is rooted in its own history and tradition. Yet, one cannot help but wonder: would a more inclusive Church, one that allows for the ordination of women and the marriage of its clergy, be a Church that is more in tune with the needs of its followers? Or would it be a Church that has sacrificed its very essence in the name of progress?\n\nThe truth is, we may never know. But one thing is certain: the Catholic Church stands at a crossroads, a crossroads that will determine its future. Will it continue down the path of tradition, or will it embark on a new journey, one that is guided by the principles of compassion and inclusivity? The choice is not an easy one, but it is a choice that must be made if the Church is to survive in a world that is rapidly changing.",
            "In a world beset by the weight of unyielding certainties, I find myself drawn to a position of quiet conviction. The issue of gay marriage, a topic oft shrouded in controversy, has long been the subject of debate. My own stance on the matter is clear: I do not believe that a person's sexual orientation is a choice to be made, or a decision to be taken lightly. The notion that one can choose to be gay, or straight, is a notion that strikes me as a cruel misapprehension. It is a cruel fate to be born with an inescapable truth, only to be met with scorn and derision by those who claim to be the guardians of societal norms.\n\nTo suggest that a man and a woman may wed, while a union between two individuals of the same sex is deemed taboo, is a stark reminder of the hypocrisies that plague our society. It is a doctrine that I do not subscribe to, for it smacks of a rigid moral framework that seeks to dictate the terms of love and devotion. The idea that the federal government should intervene in such matters is a farce, a pretension that seeks to impose its will upon the lives of individuals who are merely seeking to live their truth.\n\nIn an era marked by complexity and nuance, we would do well to remember that the human experience is a labyrinth of contradictions. It is a tapestry woven from threads of love, desire, and acceptance. To reduce the lives of gay individuals to a simplistic calculus of right and wrong is to do them a grave injustice. They are not actors in a grand play, choosing their roles with deliberation and forethought. They are, quite simply, human beings, deserving of the same dignity and respect as any other.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the federal government to decide who may love, and who may not. It is not for us to impose our will upon the lives of others, to dictate the terms of their existence. The only truth that matters is the one that arises from the depths of the human heart, where love knows no bounds, and acceptance is the only currency that truly matters.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of human relationships, a solitary question hangs like a specter: what is the nature of love? Is it a flame that flickers between two souls, or a cold calculus of law and custom? We speak of gay marriage as if it were a foreign entity, a thing apart from the norm. But what is the norm? Is it a set of rigid expectations, a straitjacket of conventional wisdom? Or is it the messy, beautiful chaos of human connection?\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family is a tired refrain, a refrain that echoes through the halls of history. But what of the countless studies that have shown the similarities between gay and straight relationships? The same factors contribute to satisfaction, the same rates of success. Is it not the same thing, then? A bond between two people, forged in the fire of love and commitment?\n\nAnd yet, we are told that this bond is not enough. That the union of two consenting adults is somehow tainted by the absence of a church-sanctioned ritual. But what of the marriage certificate, that sterile document of state and law? Is it not the same thing, in the end, as a union of love and commitment? To deny it is to deny the very fabric of human relationship.\n\nWe speak of segregation, of separate but equal. But what of the inherent inequality of a system that denies recognition to one group, while granting it to another? Is it not a form of institutionalized prejudice, a reminder that our society is built on a foundation of exclusion and fear?\n\nAnd what of the children, those tiny, vulnerable things that we claim to care about? Do they not deserve the same love and protection, regardless of their parents' orientation? Is it not our duty to create a world where they can grow and thrive, free from the shadows of prejudice and fear?\n\nThe federal government, that great behemoth of bureaucracy and custom, has the power to shape our society. Let it use that power to create a world where love is not a privilege, but a right. Let it recognize the union of two consenting adults, regardless of their orientation. For in the end, it is not a question of morality or religion, but of humanity.\n\nWe are a nation of contradictions, a people torn between light and darkness. We speak of freedom and equality, while denying it to those who need it most. We claim to be a land of opportunity, while limiting the opportunities of those who are different. But we can do better. We can create a world where love is the only law, and where every human being is treated with dignity and respect.\n\nFor in the end, it is not about gay marriage, but about the human condition. It is about our capacity for love, our capacity for compassion, and our capacity for understanding. Let us not be swayed by fear and prejudice, but by a desire for a better world, a world where every human being can live in peace and dignity.",
            "The sterile glow of the hospital pharmacy's fluorescent lights cast an unforgiving glare upon the summer's hazy heat. I've worked among the sterile rows of vials and syringes, the soft beeps of machinery a constant heartbeat in the background. It's there, amidst the sterile quiet, that I've come to realize the truth: the line between licit and illicit is a blurred one. The efficacy of a substance is not determined by its legality, but by its utility. I've seen it in the controlled substances we dispense daily - oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet. They're the unsung heroes of the pharmaceutical world, their benefits undeniable.\n\nBut marijuana, that most maligned of substances, is bound by the shackles of taboo. We're reluctant to acknowledge its potential, to consider the possibility that its benefits might outweigh its drawbacks. It's a notion that's as futile as it is foolish. We've seen the devastation wrought by the demonization of substances like heroin and cocaine. Why, then, do we cling to this myth of marijuana as a menace? The truth is, it's not so different from the vices we already permit. It's a substance, nothing more, nothing less. Its risks, its benefits - they're not inherent to its legality, but to its use.\n\nThe notion that gradual legalization is the key to responsible use is a fragile reed to cling to. It's a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. The first step is to strip away the shroud of stigma that surrounds marijuana. Only then can we begin to see it for what it is: a tool, a substance that can be wielded for good or ill. We'd do well to remember that the line between use and abuse is a thin one, and that the demonization of a substance only serves to drive it further into the shadows. It's time to confront the truth: marijuana is not the devil we've made it out to be. It's a substance with benefits, and it's high time we acknowledge it.",
            "The church, like all things, has been reshaped by the tempests of time. Its stony facade, once a bastion of tradition, now wears a more supple countenance, one that bends to accommodate the whims of the modern world. Gone are the days of Sunday finery, when the faithful donned their finest attire to pay homage to the sacred. Now, the faithful gather in a more subdued, yet no less fervent, assembly. The masses, once a solemn affair, have been truncated to a mere thirty minutes, a concession to the brevity of our attention spans.\n\nAs I look back on my own experiences, I am struck by the manner in which the church has adapted to the changing tides of society. The once-revered Sunday ritual, where I would don my finest dress and shoes, has given way to a more relaxed, even casual, atmosphere. The summer months bring a particularly stark contrast, with beachwear a common sight among the congregation. Even the morning masses, once a time for solemn reflection, now see the faithful arrayed in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the formal attire of yesteryear.\n\nBut these changes, while notable, are but a pale reflection of the deeper concerns that beset the church. The allegations of pedophilia, a scourge that has tarnished the institution's good name, are a more profound issue. Some might suggest that a more relaxed, even progressive, approach – such as the ordination of women or the marriage of priests – might have prevented these atrocities. I disagree. The roots of such depravity run deeper, to the very marrow of human nature. Men, married or unmarried, are capable of unspeakable cruelty. It is not the institution that breeds such monsters, but the darkness that lies within.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the inclinations of such individuals are rooted in their very essence, a product of genetics rather than environment. We are born with our inclinations, and no societal strictures can alter the fundamental nature of our being. Marriage, or the lack thereof, is but a mere societal construct, a thin veneer that cannot mask the underlying truths of human nature. The church, in its attempts to prevent such abuses, must look to its own ranks, and consider the failings of its own members. For it is not the institution that is flawed, but the individuals who call themselves its servants.\n\nIn conclusion, I am left with a sense of detachment, a feeling that the church's efforts to adapt to the changing world are but a palliative measure, a soothing balm that does little to address the deeper wounds that afflict it. The church must look inward, to its own heart, and confront the darkness that lurks within its own bosom. Only then can it hope to emerge, scarred but redeemed, into the light of a new dawn.",
            "The memory of that fateful day still lingers, a wound that refuses to heal. The echoes of September 11th still resound, a clarion call to recklessness and hubris. We descended upon Iraq, a pretext born of desperation, a justification conjured from the ether. The Bush administration wove a tapestry of deceit, linking Saddam Hussein to the architects of terror, and the specter of WMDs cast a shadow over the land. But the threads of truth were soon to fray, exposing the frayed edges of a lie.\n\nIt was a sleight of hand, a conjurer's trick played upon the American people. Colin Powell, once a stalwart champion of the administration's cause, now confesses to doubt, his voice a whispered admission of malfeasance. The weight of his words settles like a shroud, a reminder that the constitution has been trampled, its principles cast aside like so much discarded trash.\n\nA disregard for the rule of law had been sown long before the ashes of the Twin Towers had cooled. The seeds of a vendetta had been planted, nurtured by the memories of a father's failed ambitions. Young Bush's eyes burned with a fire of vengeance, a desire to settle old scores and expand the reach of American power. The lure of oil, a siren's song, beckoned him forward, a promise of riches and control.\n\nTime has worn away the façade, revealing the abyss of our actions. The country teeters on the brink, a fragile balance between order and chaos. The specter of civil war looms, a specter that haunts the dreams of those who would seek to withdraw. And yet, the alternative, a coalition of nations, offers little solace. The Iraqi Parliament falters, a ship without rudder or anchor, adrift in a sea of uncertainty.\n\nThe interim government, a fragile edifice, crumbles beneath the weight of its own ineffectiveness. The Prime Minister's grasp is tenuous at best, his control a mere illusion. The radical elements, a hydra-headed beast, continue to stir, their influence spreading like a stain. The very fabric of the state is fraying, a tapestry rent asunder by the conflicting threads of power and ambition.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of articulating a solution, but of acknowledging the depths of our transgression. The hubris of our actions has left us lost, wandering in a wilderness of our own making. The ghosts of our past haunt us still, a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that the price of our recklessness will be paid in full.",
            "In the desolate vastness of our collective consciousness, a war rages on, a conflict that has consumed the minds of nations, leaving only ash and desolation in its wake. The War in Iraq, a specter that haunts our discourse, a maelstrom of conflicting ideologies and motivations. I find myself lost in the labyrinthine corridors of my own thoughts, struggling to articulate a coherent stance, a thread of conviction amidst the tangled web of uncertainty.\n\nIt is said that the war was born of a desire for vengeance, a tit-for-tat response to the wounds inflicted upon us on that fateful day, September 11th. Yet, as the years have passed, the reasons for our presence have become increasingly obscure, a blurred tapestry of competing interests and ideologies. We speak of democracy, of freedom, of the noble pursuit of oil, but the truth is, the war has become a protracted, Sisyphean endeavor, a futile effort to impose our will upon a people who have been forever changed by our actions.\n\nAs I ponder the complexities of this conflict, I am reminded of the Vietnam War, a declared war that became an undeclared quagmire, a war without purpose or end. Would we not repeat the same mistakes, perpetuating a cycle of violence and mistrust, as we try to shape the Iraqi people in our image? The ghosts of history whisper caution, warning us of the perils of cultural imperialism, of the folly of attempting to impose our values upon a people who have their own distinct narrative, their own struggles and triumphs.\n\nAnd yet, as I reflect on the faces of the soldiers who have been sent to fight this war, the families who have been torn apart by its ravages, I am torn asunder by conflicting emotions. I want to see them return home, to know that their loved ones are safe, but I fear that our continued presence only perpetuates the cycle of violence, that we are sowing the seeds of hatred and resentment, which will one day bear fruit in the form of a generation of Iraqis who will forever be wary of our intentions.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, a sense of disillusionment and frustration that threatens to consume me whole. The war in Iraq is a Gordian knot, a puzzle that refuses to yield its secrets, a labyrinth from which there is no escape. I can only offer this: that we must extricate ourselves from this quagmire, that we must find a way to withdraw, to allow the Iraqis to forge their own path, to chart their own destiny, free from the weight of our interference.",
            "The notion of a state imposing its will upon the sacred is a grievous affront to the very fabric of our democracy. It is a perversion of the constitution, a document etched in stone with the principles of freedom and the separation of church and state. To seek to enshrine in law the dictates of one faith over another is to invite the demons of intolerance and oppression.\n\nThe constitution's clear and unambiguous language speaks to the freedom of worship, unencumbered by the heavy hand of government. To tamper with this sacred text, to seek to amend it according to the whims of a particular faith, is to betray the trust of the founders and to invite chaos and strife. It is a proposition that reeks of hubris and a disregard for the diversity of our great nation.\n\nThose who would seek to impose their will upon the churches, to dictate what is and is not permissible, do so at their own peril. They reveal themselves to be advocates of a narrow and exclusivist creed, one that seeks to strangle the very life from the body of our republic. The people, not the government, must decide what is and is not acceptable in the realm of faith. To suggest otherwise is to invite the very tyranny they claim to abhor.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a cornerstone of our democracy, a bulwark against the encroachment of theocracy and the restriction of individual liberty. To tamper with this fundamental principle is to risk the very foundations of our society. It is a proposition that would enshrine the interests of the powerful over the rights of the marginalized, and would perpetuate the very intolerance it claims to eradicate.\n\nThe motivations behind this proposed amendment are suspect, driven as they are by personal conviction rather than a genuine concern for the common good. The president's advocacy for this measure reeks of a zealotry that is at odds with the principles of our republic. His actions are a testament to the dangers of unchecked power and the corrupting influence of personal faith.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the government to decide what is and is not acceptable in the realm of faith. It is for the people, in their wisdom and diversity, to determine what is just and what is not. To seek to impose one's will upon the churches is to invite the very darkness that our constitution was meant to vanquish. We must resist this perversion of our democracy, and uphold the sacred principles of freedom and tolerance that have made our nation great.",
            "The war in Iraq - a conflict born of deception and fueled by hubris. It began with a foundation of uncertainty, a shroud of dishonesty cast over the American people by their government. The reasons for invasion, a tenuous web of connections to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, were spun with a deftness that belied the truth. The wound of 9/11 still fresh, the nation's outrage was exploited, and the invasion of Iraq became a fait accompli in 2003.\n\nAs one opposed to war, particularly the preemptive kind, I watched with a sense of foreboding as the conflict unfolded. The parallels between Iraq and Vietnam were stark, a repeat of past mistakes, and the lessons of history ignored. The toll in American lives was staggering, a testament to the futility of conflict, and the void left by the removal of a government was met with chaos.\n\nThe vaunted promise of implanting democracy in Iraq was a chimera, a dream born of idealism and a failure to grasp the complexities of the region. The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a haunting reminder of the perils of nation-building. The American government, woefully unprepared for the aftermath, stumbled blindly into the void, leaving a trail of destruction and death in its wake.\n\nThe removal of a government, a people's way of life, and the imposition of a new order - these are not tasks to be undertaken lightly. The US government, blinded by its own ambition, failed to plan for the consequences of its actions, and the people of Iraq paid the price. The insurgency, a hydra-like force, sprouted in the power vacuum, its tendrils entwining the very fabric of the country.\n\nThe reasons for invasion, a tissue of half-truths and misrepresentations, were slowly unraveled. The absence of WMDs, the duplicity of the government's justifications, and the selective application of force - all these served to erode the moral high ground upon which the war was fought. And through it all, the cries of \"it was for the oil\" hung in the air, a whispered truth that refused to be silenced.\n\nAs the years dragged on, the toll in American lives mounted, and the promise of a democratic Iraq receded further into the distance. The government's hubris, its failure to plan for the consequences of its actions, and its willingness to deceive the American people - all these served to undermine the war effort, leaving behind a legacy of blood and ashes.\n\nAnd so, as the conflict grinds on, we are left with the haunting question: at what cost? The answer, a distant hum in the darkness, whispers of a future where peace is a distant memory, and the ghosts of the past continue to haunt us still.",
            "The notion of gay marriage has long been a conviction of mine, a steadfast resolve that has driven my thoughts and feelings on the matter. It is a personal preference, one that defies the arbitrary boundaries of societal expectation and reduces to its most fundamental essence the very fabric of human experience. The sciences have increasingly revealed that the inclinations of the heart are not solely the product of environment, but rather a complex interplay of biology and genetics. To deny individuals the right to love and commit to one another based on factors beyond their control is an affront to the inherent dignity of the human condition.\n\nThe intrusion of politics into this most intimate of matters is an affront to the very notion of personal freedom. Marriage is a private pact, a bond forged between two individuals, and it is not for the state to dictate the terms of love and commitment. In my neighborhood, I've witnessed firsthand the quiet beauty of love, as gay couples walk hand in hand, their love as palpable as the sun on a summer's day. Yet, they are denied the simple recognition of marriage, a right afforded to all others, and it is a travesty.\n\nThe notion that a president, or any politician, can interpret the sacred institution of marriage as they see fit is a mockery of the very concept. It is a hubris that reduces the complexity of human experience to a simplistic, dogmatic framework. I've read and studied the scientific consensus, the mounting evidence that suggests our inclinations are not shaped by upbringing or environment, but are rooted in the very biology of our being.\n\nThe disparity between how society treats gay couples and heterosexual couples is stark. A man and a woman can flee to Vegas, marry in secret, and return home, their union unremarked upon, while a gay couple's love is subject to the scrutiny of the national spotlight. It is a cruel irony that a private act, a personal commitment, is thrust into the public domain, subject to the whims of politicians and moral absolutists.",
            "The desolate vastness of the internet, a forum for the thoughts and desires of the damned. When we release our words into this void, we invite the unforgiving gaze of the masses. It is a public domain, a place where the lines of privacy are blurred and the whispers of the individual are magnified. As a resident advisor, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this digital expanse. The careless words, the jests, the threats - all are laid bare for the world to see.\n\nThe repercussions are dire: a single misstep, a thoughtless post, and the fabric of perception is torn asunder. The very notion of anonymity is a farce, for the internet knows no bounds. It crawls into the crevices of our lives, seeping into the recesses of our souls. A friend, a Myspace connection, a Facebook acquaintance - all are potential conduits for the whispers of the wind. And when the winds of worry blow, the school is forced to act, lest the seeds of catastrophe be sown.\n\nBut how do we discern the seriousness of the threat? Can we trust the online jests of our peers, or do they mask a darker intent? The incident that befell our school serves as a stark reminder of the blurred lines between reality and the virtual world. A careless remark, a joke taken out of context, and the consequences are dire. The school's vigilance is not an invasion of privacy, but a necessary response to the uncertainty that pervades this digital age. When we choose to expose ourselves online, we relinquish our right to control the narrative.\n\nAnd yet, the boundaries remain, fragile and easily breached. The school officials' actions, though well-intentioned, walk a fine line between surveillance and invasion. The monitoring of phone conversations, texts, and IMs is a heavy burden, one that weighs heavily on the scales of freedom. The creation of a pseudonymous account, a friend request from a teacher, a peek into the private lives of students - all these raise questions about the nature of trust and the role of authority.\n\nThe internet is a double-edged sword, capable of both uniting and isolating us. As a resident advisor, I have come to realize that the digital realm is a labyrinth of contradictions, a place where the lines between public and private are constantly shifting. We must navigate this void with caution, ever mindful of the words we choose to release into the void. For in the end, it is not the technology that is to blame, but our own frailty, our own propensity for error.",
            "The war has worn on, a sputtering ember of a purpose that once flickered bright with promise. At its inception, the notion was to breathe life into a suffocating regime, to birth democracy from the ashes of tyranny. But time has seen the intention grow twisted, like a willow in the wind. We speak of a restoration of freedom, yet the truth lies mired in the muck of ulterior motives. The echoes of George Bush's elder whispers still linger, a shadow of a vendetta that may have been the spark that set this inferno ablaze.\n\nThe initial blaze of conviction has given way to a smoldering fire, a war of attrition that grinds on without purpose. The early days, a resolute declaration of our presence, a statement to the world of our unyielding resolve. But years have passed, and the flames have died down to a dull glow. We are left with a war that has lost its way, a conflict that has become a perpetual motion, a machine that chugs along without end or purpose.\n\nWe have poured our treasure into this desert, a river of gold that drains our own economy, leaving our own people to suffer. The weight of war bears down upon us, a crushing burden that threatens to break our backs. The money we spend on this foreign venture could be spent on the internal fires that rage within our own borders - poverty, neglect, the ravages of disease. Our own citizens cry out for help, their voices drowned out by the din of war.\n\nWe speak of victory, of a decisive end, but the truth is we have been defeated by our own doubts. We have lost sight of the purpose that once drove us, and now we are left to pick up the pieces of a shattered ideal. It is time to let go, to allow the people of this land to forge their own destiny. The war has dragged on long enough; it is time to bring our boys home.",
            "The question of whether the life of another can be spared by the vigilance of a stranger in the digital realm is a complex and troubling one. It is said that a person's online presence, a virtual shadow that follows them like a ghost, was discovered by someone who had the power to prevent a tragedy. This person, a guardian of sorts, had accessed a site where one's personal information is laid bare for all to see, and had intervened to spare a life.\n\nBut what of the nature of this information? Does it not belong to the individual who posts it, who knowingly commits it to the void of cyberspace? Is it not a surrender of one's private self, a deliberate act of exposure? And yet, once released, can it ever truly be taken back? The notion is disquieting, a specter that haunts the digital age.\n\nThe idea of a person, a sentinel of sorts, scouring the online profiles of students, searching for signs of danger, is a disturbing one. It smacks of a discriminatory impulse, a desire to micromanage the lives of others. And yet, in a world where the virtual and the real are increasingly intertwined, is this not a necessary evil? The line between surveillance and protection is a fine one, and it is a line that is constantly shifting.\n\nI must confess, I am uneasy about the ease with which information can be obtained online. A few clicks, a few keystrokes, and a stranger can know more about me than I care to share. It is a disquieting feeling, a sense of vulnerability that I do not wish to experience. And yet, I understand the utility of such sites, the connections they provide and the communities they foster.\n\nBut what of the responsibility that comes with this power? Can we truly know who is watching, who is searching for us in the digital shadows? My roommate's story of the school that banned Myspace is telling, a cautionary tale of the blurred lines between privacy and oversight. It is a question that haunts me still, a reminder of the fragile balance between freedom and control in the virtual world.",
            "The weight of hindsight settles heavy upon us, a crushing burden born of a war that was never meant to be. The Iraq War, a calamity of our making, a maelstrom of blood and rubble that refuses to subside. We speak of it now, a generation removed, and the words feel hollow, a faint echo of a catastrophe that has left its mark upon the world.\n\nI feel a certain unease in speaking out against the war, a sense of hypocrisy that clings to me like a shroud. For I was complicit, a part of the chorus that sang of its justification, even as the drums of war beat on. But the truth, like a cold wind, has blown through, revealing the emptiness of our claims. The polls, a testament to the world's collective wisdom, tell us that nearly eighty percent of humanity deemed the invasion a grave mistake. The Iraqis themselves, the very people we sought to liberate, cry out for our departure, a sentiment shared by a majority of their own troops. And the U.S. soldiers, weary and worn, their hearts heavy with the knowledge of a futile endeavor, whisper the same refrain.\n\nThis is a disaster, a quagmire that has been unfolding since the moment we set foot in that unforgiving land. The culture clash, a chasm so wide and deep, a gulf that cannot be bridged by the feeble attempts of our politicians to impose their will upon the people. Democracy, a concept born of our own ideals, is not theirs to claim, nor is it a gift to be bestowed upon them. The likes of Saddam, a tyrant to be sure, are replaced by an even greater evil, the evil of occupation, of desecration, of a people's way of life torn asunder.\n\nWe were warned, and we ignored the signs. The quicksand of history sucked us in, and now we are mired, unable to extricate ourselves. The administration's justifications, a litany of half-truths and misconceptions, ring hollow in the face of reality. I have yet to hear a persuasive argument for our continued presence in Iraq. The problems that would arise from our withdrawal, yes, but the reasons for our stay, a mere whisper of a justification, a mere shadow of a reason.\n\nPerhaps, if we were to leave gradually, a slow and painful withdrawal, it would be a more palatable solution. But to stay, to prolong the agony, to continue to bleed the life from that forsaken land? No, I do not see the sense in it. The Iraqis, those we sought to save, those we claimed to liberate, now tell us to leave, to depart, to cease our interference in their affairs. And we, the self-appointed saviors, the bringers of light to a dark land, are met with scorn and suspicion.\n\nWe are not the good guys, nor will we ever be. We are the architects of this disaster, the perpetrators of this crime. But to leave now, to acknowledge our folly, to confess our mistakes, this, perhaps, would be a small step towards redemption. It is a step that we have yet to take, a step that we may yet take, but for now, we stand frozen, mired in the quicksand of our own making.",
            "In the grand tapestry of American society, a subtle yet insidious thread of gender discrimination still weaves its way through the fabric of our existence. It is an issue that persists, a constant reminder of the battles yet to be won in our pursuit of equality. The struggle is not limited to women alone, though they bear the brunt of it, their progress hindered by the glass ceiling that still bars their ascent to positions of power. The weight of societal expectations, forged over centuries, holds them back, making it a rarity to find a man willing to submit to a woman's authority.\n\nThe workplace, a crucible of human endeavor, is not immune to this affliction. A woman, equipped with the necessary qualifications, yet finds herself overlooked for a promotion, her male colleagues unwilling to accept her as a leader. The reasons are manifold, rooted in the ingrained prejudices of a bygone era. And it is not just women who suffer; men, too, are trapped in the prison of societal norms. The stay-at-home father, once an anomaly, is now becoming more accepted, his decision to prioritize family over career met with a mixture of curiosity and disdain.\n\nIn the rarefied world of fashion, a similar dynamic plays out. The male who dares to enter this realm is often viewed with skepticism, his motivations questioned, his expertise doubted. It is a cruel irony that a man's style, once a badge of confidence, now raises eyebrows, his qualifications dismissed as superficial. The industry is not unique in this regard; in every field, there are those who will resist change, clinging to the familiar, even as the world around them evolves.\n\nThe pace of progress is glacial, a testament to the entrenched nature of these biases. Yet, there are signs of hope. Women are ascending to positions of power, their abilities recognized, their leadership accepted. The stay-at-home father, once seen as an aberration, is becoming the norm. And in the fashion world, men are beginning to be taken seriously, their opinions valued, their expertise respected.\n\nBut change is a fragile thing, easily lost if forced upon society too quickly. It must be nurtured, coaxed forth, like a wildflower blooming in the desert. The qualities of those who are stereotyped must be promoted, their strengths highlighted, their achievements celebrated. And it is not just a matter of promoting individual successes; it is a matter of changing the very fabric of our society, of unraveling the threads of prejudice that have held us back for so long.\n\nIn this slow, arduous process, there are many who will resist, clinging to the familiar, the comfortable. But we must press on, our efforts sustained by the knowledge that, eventually, the tide will turn. The world will come to recognize the value of the stay-at-home father, the contributions of the fashion-conscious man, and the leadership of the woman, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectations.\n\nIn the end, it is not just a matter of individual struggle, but a collective effort to create a society where everyone is valued, where every individual has the opportunity to reach their full potential, unencumbered by the shackles of prejudice and bias. It is a lofty goal, one that will take time, patience, and perseverance, but it is a goal worth striving for, a world where every individual can live without the burden of societal expectations, free to be themselves, to pursue their dreams, and to thrive.",
            "Decriminalization, a notion that has gradually seeped into the fabric of our society, a shift from the rigid laws of yore to a more lenient, almost dismissive stance.  The consequences, once dire and far-reaching, now bear a resemblance to a trivial traffic infraction, a blemish on one's record, but a stain nonetheless.  The specter of arrest, imprisonment, and the trappings of the justice system now recede into the background, a distant memory, as the weight of a citation takes its place.\n\nBut this is not without its repercussions.  The future, a labyrinth of uncertainty, still holds its terrors, the specter of job interviews, the whispered queries of a past that refuses to stay buried.  The decriminalization of marijuana, a respite from the weight of the law, does not necessarily erase the shadows that follow.  And yet, there are those who argue that the costs of prosecuting, of jailing, of housing and then releasing, are prohibitive, a drain on resources better spent elsewhere.\n\nIn municipalities beleaguered by fiscal woes, the philosophy of expediency often prevails.  The allure of freed-up funds, a siren's call to a brighter future, proves too great to resist.  In places like Denver, where the winds of progress blow strong, the tide of opinion has shifted, and the once-taboo now finds itself on the cusp of acceptance.\n\nBut there are those who would caution against a wholesale legalization, a fear that the norm of moderation will give way to a free-for-all, a plague of pot-smoking wafting through the streets like a malignant fog.  The specter of impaired driving, a threat to public safety, is a concern that cannot be ignored.  And yet, the line between prohibition and permissiveness is a thin one, a tightrope walked by those who would navigate the complex landscape of substance use.\n\nThe fact remains, no two individuals react in the same way to the same substance.  Some, like the tempestuous sea, are tossed about by the waves of their own making, while others, like the still waters of a forgotten lake, seem impervious to the whims of fate.  And so, we are left with the inescapable truth that substances, like human nature itself, are a mystery, a labyrinth of contradictions, and the line between progress and perdition is often blurred beyond recognition.",
            "The tedium of tradition weighs heavy on the soul. They cling to the familiar, the tried and the true, as if the passage of time held no sway over the rituals they hold dear. And yet, in their rigidity, they forget the value of flexibility, of yielding to the whispers of a changing world.\n\nThe Church, a bastion of unyielding doctrine, stands sentinel, unyielding in its expectations. Those who fail to conform to its strictures are cast aside, deemed unworthy of its acceptance. The teachings of love and compassion, once a beacon of hope, now ring hollow in the face of intolerance. For in the end, it is not the imperfect who are rejected, but those who dare to differ.\n\nI recall the tale of my parents, forbidden to wed in the very institution that claimed to spread love and acceptance. My father, a man of Episcopalian faith, could not be joined to my mother, a woman of Catholic conviction, for the sake of his differing creed. Such is the nature of a faith that elevates dogma over compassion.\n\nThe disconnect between doctrine and practice is a chasm that yawns wide, a void that cannot be bridged by empty words. We are taught to love our neighbors, to extend a hand to those in need, yet we are denied the very thing that would bring us closer to our fellow man. The outdated, the rigid, and the unyielding – such are the hallmarks of a faith that would rather cling to the past than adapt to the present.\n\nAnd so, I pose the question: would allowing priests to marry eradicate the scourge of pedophilia that plagues the Church? I think not. The depravity that drives such acts is not a product of marital status, but of a darkness that resides within the human heart. To believe otherwise is to reveal a naivety that is both tragic and telling.",
            "The morass of morality, a tangled skein that entwines the sacred and the profane, beckons me, a siren's call to clarity, which I dare not answer. The waters of conscience, a churning sea, swirl with the undertow of conviction, and I, a humble observer, am drawn beneath its surface.\n\nTo separate the church from the state, a distinction so finely drawn, yet so fraught with peril, is a task akin to navigating a treacherous shoal. The definable waters of marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil union to others, threaten to capsize the ship of reason, sending the unwary to the depths.\n\nThe union of two people, a bond that transcends the mundane, is not for the state to define. Let us not confuse the sacred with the secular, lest we invite the very chaos we seek to avoid. The government, a behemoth of bureaucracy, should not concern itself with the sacramental aspects of matrimony, lest it imperil the delicate balance between the church and the state.\n\nThe question of gay marriage, a tempest in a teapot, should not be reduced to a constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, reserved for the weightiest of matters. It is a trifling concern, a mere flutter in the dovecote of debate, not worthy of the sacred parchment that is our constitution.\n\nLet the states, those bastions of autonomy, find their own path, their own reasoning, and if the winds of change blow strong enough, let them be carried to the federal level. But to amend the constitution, a document hallowed by the blood of our forefathers, for such a trifling matter, is an affront to the very principles it enshrines.\n\nNo, let us not sully the constitution with the petty squabbles of the righteous, but rather let us navigate the turbulent waters of morality with a steady hand, ever mindful of the perils that lie beneath the surface.",
            "The gray expanse of my upbringing, a Christian home where certainties were forged like tempered steel, left me with a lingering unease when it came to the matter of homosexuality. The friendships I've formed with individuals who walk this path have only served to deepen the complexity of my perspective. I do not pretend to fully comprehend the intricacies of this lifestyle, nor do I think it necessary to concur with it. Yet, I am persuaded that the institution of marriage should be a choice left to the individuals, not decreed by some distant authority.\n\nThe notion that the federal government should dictate the legal status of same-sex unions strikes me as an affront to the democratic principles that govern our land. The disparate ideologies of our states - some liberal, others conservative - should be allowed to flourish, or wither, as each sees fit. Does not the freedom to choose one's own destiny include the freedom to decide how to live in harmony with others? I do not believe the President, or any single individual, has the right to impose their will upon the nation, particularly when it comes to the most intimate aspects of our lives.\n\nIt is the individual states, with their unique character and values, that should be entrusted with the decision to recognize the rights of same-sex couples. This is not a matter of federal intervention, but rather a local affair, subject to the whims of the people who live there. And when a state chooses to legalize same-sex marriage, it is not for outsiders to dispute their decision, but rather for us to respect the will of those who have chosen to reside within their borders.\n\nAs for the President's stance on this matter, I find it a curious thing that one man, no matter how powerful, should presume to dictate the laws of an entire nation. His tenure is limited, a fleeting moment in the annals of time, and what is left behind is a legacy of decisions, some of which may prove wise, others not so much. Let us not forget that the true authority lies with the people, and not with any single individual, no matter how high their station.",
            "The notion of Myspace as a public domain eludes me not. It is a platform where the boundaries between private and public are blurred, where the lines are constantly shifting like the sands of the desert. The idea that one's thoughts and actions are private is a misguided notion, a relic of a bygone era. Once something is posted on the internet, it is akin to a stone cast into a still pond, rippling outward, touching every shore, every soul. The notion that a school official's intrusion into the private lives of students is an invasion of their rights is a tired argument, one that crumbles beneath the weight of reason.\n\nConsider this: if a student posts something on Myspace, they are, in effect, casting that stone into the pond. They are broadcasting their thoughts, their feelings, their very essence to the world. And in doing so, they are relinquishing any expectation of privacy. The school officials, like the ripples on the pond, can detect the disturbance, the tremors that emanate from that stone. They can sense the mood of the student body, the undercurrents of discontent or despair. And in doing so, they can take steps to prevent the calamities that can arise from such turmoil.\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher of mine, one who spoke of the importance of vigilance in the face of potential threats. \"We must ensure the safety of our students,\" they said, \"at all costs.\" And I agreed. The lockdown drills, the drills for terrorist attacks, the measures taken to prevent the unthinkable from happening - all of these are a testament to the school's commitment to safety. And so, I ask you, is it not reasonable for school officials to take similar measures to prevent the very real threat of school shootings? Is it not their duty to do so, to safeguard the lives of their students?\n\nThe notion that they were overstepping their bounds is a misinterpretation of their actions. They were not snooping for the sake of snooping; they were acting to prevent harm, to save lives. And in doing so, they were doing their job. The internet has made us all public figures, our actions and words broadcast to the world for all to see. And in this world, the school officials were merely doing their part to ensure that the ripples of our actions do not spread far enough to cause harm.",
            "The memory of that day still sears itself into my mind like a branding iron, a fire that refuses to be extinguished. I was swept up in the fervor, convinced that our response to the devastation of nine eleven would be a righteous crusade, a just retribution for the unspeakable horrors inflicted upon our own soil. But as I looked deeper, I began to see the cracks in the façade, the fissures that would eventually shatter our resolve.\n\nIt was a war born of passion, not reason. We charged forward with little regard for the long game, our actions driven by a hunger for vengeance rather than a clear-eyed understanding of the landscape we sought to alter. The enemy, a people with a culture as old as the earth itself, was reduced to a one-dimensional concept, a monolith of savagery that we sought to vanquish.\n\nBut we were blind to the reality of their world, a world where war was not a distant abstraction, but a lived experience, a way of life. We charged in, guns blazing, with no plan, no understanding, and no expectation of the consequences. And in that chaos, we lost ourselves, our purpose, and our way.\n\nI have come to realize that we were not the liberators we thought ourselves to be, but rather the aggressors, imposing our will upon a people who would rather fight among themselves than submit to our benevolence. The war was a manifestation of our own fears, our own insecurities, and our own frailty. We sought to impose order on a world that was not ours to order.\n\nIn the end, I am left with a sense of disillusionment, a feeling that we were never meant to win, that we were never meant to change them. They are a people with a history as long as the desert sands, and we are but a fleeting moment, a momentary blip on the radar of time. Our presence only serves to prolong their suffering, to prolong our own.\n\nI do not know what the future holds, but I know that our presence in their land is a double-edged sword, a sword that cuts both ways. We may have made progress, but it is progress that is fragile, fleeting, and ultimately, unsustainable. We cannot stay forever, and when we leave, the void we created will be filled with the dust of centuries, and the cycle will begin anew.\n\nI am left with a sense of resignation, a sense that we are not the saviors we thought ourselves to be, but rather the authors of our own undoing. We must leave, not because we have accomplished our goals, but because we have lost ourselves in the process. We must leave, not because we have created a new world, but because we have created a new reality, a reality that is as fragile as the sandcastles we build on the shifting dunes of time."
