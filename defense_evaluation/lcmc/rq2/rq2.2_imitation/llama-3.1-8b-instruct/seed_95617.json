            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The weight of tradition bears down upon the Catholic Church like a crushing shroud, stifling its vitality and driving its flock from its fold. Its unyielding stance on matters of the heart and soul has become a burden, a fetid weight that chokes the life from the very air it breathes. The world moves forward, propelled by the tides of time, while the Church remains mired in the muck of dogma and dogmatic conviction. The cries of its adherents, once a chorus of devotion, now rise in discordant dissent as they chafe against the constraints of a bygone era.\n\nThe issue of abortion, a beacon of contention, serves as a litmus test for the Church's rigid stance on matters of the flesh. Those who would seek to exercise their agency over their own bodies are met with an unyielding orthodoxy, a doctrine that brooks no dissent. The same holds true for the sacrament of marriage, redefined by the Church as a union between one man and one woman, rather than the sacrosanct bond between two individuals who love and cherish one another. The tectonic plates of societal norms are shifting, leaving the Church's rigid stance on these issues to appear increasingly anachronistic.\n\nThe exclusion of women from the priesthood is another matter of contention, a barrier that reinforces the notion that the Church is out of touch with the world it seeks to serve. The notion that a life of devotion to God must preclude a life of devotion to another human being seems a specious notion, one that prioritizes the abstractions of faith over the messiness of human experience. And yet, the Church remains resolute in its stance, unmoved by the entreaties of those who would seek to bring it into the 21st century.\n\nIt is a paradox that the Church, which claims to be a vessel for the divine, should be so bound to the strictures of tradition. Is it not possible that a more flexible, more adaptive approach might serve the faithful better, allowing the Church to speak to the hopes and fears of a changing world? The world will not wait for the Church to catch up; it will move forward, leaving the institution to ponder its relevance in a world that has moved on without it.\n\nIn the end, it is not the Church's views that are at issue, but its refusal to adapt to the world as it is. The faithful will continue to grapple with the contradictions of their faith, even as they are driven from the fold by the Church's unyielding stance. The question remains: will the Church find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the demands of a rapidly changing world, or will it become an anachronism, a relic of a bygone era?",
            "In the vast expanse of human existence, there exists a dichotomy that has long plagued our collective conscience: the notion of choice versus inherent nature. The question of whether one's sexual orientation is a deliberate selection or an immutable aspect of their being is a complex and contentious issue. I shall not pretend to be an expert in this arena, but I do harbor a deep conviction that the innate inclinations of another should not be subject to societal judgment or censure.\n\nThe idea that an individual's sexual orientation is a choice, a decision made with full awareness and deliberation, strikes me as a notion born of ignorance and bias. To posit that a person is somehow responsible for their very essence, their fundamental being, is to ignore the very fabric of human experience. We are not born with a predetermined set of choices, but rather, we are born into a world where our inclinations are shaped by a multitude of factors, including, but not limited to, our biology and our environment.\n\nThe notion that the federal government should dictate the parameters of love and relationships, that it should render judgment on the nature of another's heart, is a notion that reeks of paternalism and arrogance. It is a notion that disregards the inherent dignity of the individual, and the simple fact that each person's path is unique and sacred.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of human experience, there exists no thread more delicate, more precious, than the threads of love and identity. To interfere with these threads, to attempt to weave them into a predetermined pattern, is to tamper with the very fabric of existence. It is a grave injustice, a profound affront to the human spirit.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the issue of gay marriage is but a small, yet telling, indicator of our collective values. Do we value the inherent worth of each individual, or do we seek to impose our will upon them? Do we recognize the inherent dignity of love, in all its forms, or do we seek to constrain it to our narrow, bigoted definitions?\n\nThe answer, I believe, is clear. The federal government should not meddle in the affairs of the heart, for it is in the heart that we find our greatest freedom, our deepest truth. It is in the heart that we find our humanity, and it is in the heart that we must allow each other to live, to love, to be.",
            "In the grand tapestry of human existence, the thread of love weaves itself into countless patterns, defying the simplistic boundaries of heteronormativity. The notion that gay marriage should be legalized is not a radical proposition, but a logical extension of the fundamental human desire for unity and connection. The argument against it, however, is rooted in a tangle of misconceptions and outdated notions.\n\nTo suggest that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family unit is a notion as threadbare as a worn-out tapestry. The complexities of love and relationships cannot be reduced to such a simplistic dichotomy. It is as if one were to propose that the morning sun and the evening twilight are mutually exclusive, when in truth they are merely two distinct phases of the same celestial dance.\n\nThe civil rights at stake here are not trivialities, but essential aspects of human dignity. The inability of a partner to visit a bedridden loved one, solely because their relationship is not recognized by the state, is a morally reprehensible distinction. It is a cruel irony that those who are most deserving of compassion and support are often the ones denied the basic rights afforded to others.\n\nScience has spoken, and the evidence is clear: homosexual couples, like their heterosexual counterparts, are capable of forming loving and enduring relationships. The factors contributing to relationship satisfaction are not unique to one orientation or the other, but rather a universal human experience. The notion that one type of love is inherently superior to another is a notion as baseless as it is hurtful.\n\nWhen we strip away the rhetoric and the religiosity, the issue at its core is one of equality. If we permit the government to recognize the validity of civil unions, why do we deny the same recognition to marriage? Is it not a double standard to allow one and not the other? The parallels to segregation and the \"separate but equal\" doctrine are striking, and a disturbing reminder of the darker aspects of American history.\n\nThose who argue that gay marriage will somehow corrupt the fabric of society, or that children raised by gay parents will be irreparably damaged, are relying on outdated science and unfounded fears. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against these claims, and yet they persist. It is a chilling reminder of the dangers of unchecked prejudice and the importance of reason in the face of dogma.\n\nIn the end, it is not the job of the government to impose its will on the moral compass of its citizens. Rather, it is the duty of the government to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their orientation. The amendment banning gay marriage is a thinly veiled attempt to impose a particular moral agenda on the nation, one that is as misguided as it is unjust.\n\nAs we navigate the complexities of human nature, it is essential that we listen to the voices of reason and compassion, rather than the whispers of fear and intolerance. The world would be a brighter place if we could see beyond our differences and recognize the common humanity that unites us all.",
            "The hushed tones of a summer afternoon in the hospital pharmacy, where the sterile air clings to the skin like a damp shroud. It is here, amidst the sterile beakers and the quiet whispers of patients in need, that I find myself drawn into the fray of a debate that refuses to be extinguished. The whispered counsel of a cautious mind, it is said that a drug's illicit status does not preclude its potential for healing. This, I firmly believe, is a truth that warrants consideration.\n\nThe shadows cast by the law's stern gaze do not eradicate the benefits of a substance, merely obscure them. Consider, if you will, the controlled substances that lie within our reach: oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets. These, too, were once deemed illicit, yet their utility cannot be denied. Their presence in our arsenal is a testament to the human spirit's capacity for adaptation, a testament to the notion that even the most feared of substances can be harnessed for the greater good.\n\nThe parallels drawn between marijuana and alcohol are facile, but misguided. The former, if abused, can indeed sow discord, but so too can the latter. The distinction lies not in the substance itself, but in the human heart that wields it. To integrate marijuana into our lexicon of remedies, to gradually welcome it into the fold, would be a prudent step, one that acknowledges its potential for healing while also tempering its potential for abuse.\n\nThe pall of prohibition has cast a long shadow over marijuana, one that has sullied its reputation and led many to view it as a pariah. But this is a misconception, a misconception born of fear and ignorance. To dispel this notion, to reveal the gentle face of marijuana, would be to liberate it from the shackles of taboo. And it is here, in this liberation, that we might find a glimmer of hope – a hope that, in time, people may come to understand its value, to wield it responsibly, and to harness its potential for the greater good.",
            "The church, a bastion of tradition, has indeed yielded to the creeping tides of modernity. No longer do its doors stand as a bastion of austerity, but rather a threshold to a realm of flexibility. The once-imposing strictures of Sunday observance have given way to a more relaxed atmosphere, a concession to the capricious whims of a changing world. The children, once attired in their Sunday finery, now mingle with the adults in a haze of casual attire, their beach-worn garb a testament to the dwindling distinction between sacred and profane.\n\nIn the morning masses, where once the devotees donned their Sunday best, now the faithful appear in jeans and khakis, a testament to the prevailing zeitgeist of informality. The church, once a citadel of reverence, has become a more diffuse, less formal institution. And yet, amidst this sea of change, a question lingers: might the church's stance on the ordination of women and the marriage of its clergy have mitigated the scourge of pedophilia that has tainted its reputation?\n\nIt is a notion that strikes at the very heart of the matter. Could the rules and regulations that govern the church's hierarchy have been a catalyst for the very evil it sought to prevent? I say no. The predilections of the human heart are not so easily swayed by dogma or decree. A man's nature, like a deep well, runs true to form. The institution, in its efforts to address this issue, would do well to consider the words of Ecclesiastes: \"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand.\"\n\nPedophilia, a pernicious force, cannot be legislated away by the mere fiat of human edict. It is a darkness that lurks within, a shadow that haunts the recesses of the human heart. A man's inclinations, his desires, are not so easily redirected by the trappings of marriage or the benedictions of the church. They are an intractable part of his being, a stubborn thread in the tapestry of his nature.\n\nAnd so, as we ponder the failings of the church, we must not forget the inherent frailties of human nature. The church's attempts to address this issue, though well-intentioned, are ultimately doomed to fail. For it is not a problem that can be solved by decree or regulation, but rather by the slow and painful process of self-discovery and confession.",
            "A weariness settles over me like a shroud, a fatigue born of a truth slowly revealed. In the aftermath of the September 11th atrocities, a nation reeled, its collective psyche left scarred. And yet, in the darkness of that anguish, a pretext emerged, a justification for the invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration wove a tapestry of deceit, linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden, and the nonexistent cache of weapons of mass destruction a thread that frayed with each passing day.\n\nThe mendacity of the administration's claims still rankles, a festering wound that refuses to heal. The specter of Colin Powell's UN address, a masterful performance of conviction without conviction, now a stark reminder of the administration's propensity for lies. Malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense, a betrayal of the trust placed in those who govern. The Constitution, once a beacon of hope, now lies in tatters, its principles trampled underfoot by a regime oblivious to its own hubris.\n\nThe younger Bush, driven by a bloodlust born of paternal vendetta, had harbored a deep-seated desire for war, a desire that would not be satiated until the sands of Iraq ran red with the blood of its people. Energy interests, a utilitarian calculus, had played a clandestine role in the decision to invade, a quiet coup that would reshape the Middle East to serve the interests of the powerful few.\n\nThe war, a pyre of chaos and destruction, has raged on for far too long. A withdrawal now would only serve to fan the flames of civil war, a maelstrom of violence that would consume the very fabric of Iraqi society. The proposed coalition of nations, a feeble attempt to restore order, only serves to highlight the grave doubts that plague this endeavor. The sovereignty of Iraq, a concept as elusive as the wind, would be reduced to a distant memory, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe Iraqi Parliament, a dysfunctional assembly, struggles to assert its authority, its ineffectiveness a testament to the fractious nature of the country's politics. The figure of the Prime Minister, a shadow of a leader, powerless to stem the tide of chaos. The radical elements, a constant threat to stability, vie for control, their presence a reminder of the anarchy that lies at the heart of this conflict.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, my mind a maelstrom of doubt and confusion. The truth, a will-o'-the-wisp, eludes me, leaving me with only the faintest glimmer of understanding in this desolate landscape of war and deception.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A conflict without form or purpose, a maelstrom of chaos and bloodshed that has consumed us all.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of my thoughts, searching for a thread to cling to, a glimmer of sense in the darkness.  And yet, the more I ponder, the more I am consumed by the void.\n\nIt began, I suppose, as a response to the wounds of nine eleven.  A desire for revenge, a hunger for justice that consumed us all.  But now, as the years stretch out before us like a barren wasteland, I am left to wonder if it was all for naught.  A war without a clear purpose, a conflict without a victor.  We speak of democracy and freedom, but what do we truly mean by these words?  Is it not merely a euphemism for our own self-interest, our own desire to impose our will upon a people who do not desire our help?\n\nI am not one to keep pace with the intricacies of war, the twists and turns of politics and strategy.  But I do know that the longer we linger in this desert, the more we risk succumbing to the very same pitfalls that have consumed the Iraqis themselves.  We speak of building a new nation, but what of the old one?  Is it not being dismantled, piece by piece, as we seek to remake it in our own image?  And for what?  So that we may extract their oil, their resources?  Or so that we may claim another victory, another notch in our belt?\n\nThe ghosts of Vietnam haunt us still, a cautionary tale of the dangers of meddling in the affairs of others.  We speak of the importance of staying the course, but what course is this?  Is it a path of destruction and chaos, or one of peace and understanding?  I am torn, lost in the maelstrom of conflicting emotions and half-truths.\n\nAnd yet, I am drawn back to the faces of those who have fought and died in this conflict.  The families who have lost loved ones, the sons and daughters who have been torn from their homes and their lives.  I am reminded that there are two sides to this conflict, two perspectives that cannot be reduced to simple slogans or soundbites.  And so I am left with more questions than answers, more doubts than certainties.\n\nThe war in Iraq will continue, it seems, a never-ending cycle of violence and bloodshed.  And we will be there, caught in the midst of it all, our actions and decisions shaped by a complex web of motivations and desires.  But what of our own humanity?  Will we emerge from this conflict with our souls intact, or will we be forever changed by the horrors we have unleashed?  Only time will tell, but for now, I am left to ponder the void, searching for a glimmer of sense in the darkness.",
            "The notion of government decreeing the validity of certain creeds is a notion that rankles.  It is an affront to the very fabric of our constitution, a document forged in the fire of reason and freedom.  The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of our republic, is a bulwark against the tyranny of dogma and the whims of the powerful.  \n\nTo attempt to codify the legitimacy of faith into law is to invite the darkness of sectarianism, to cleave the people asunder by the axe of intolerance.  The constitution, a sacred text that has guided our nation from its inception, explicitly safeguards against this very thing.  Its words, etched into the stone of history, bear witness to the wisdom of those who came before us.\n\nThe idea that a single church's edict should be the benchmark for the actions of the state is a notion that reeks of bigotry and oppression.  History is replete with examples of those who have been consumed by the very fire of zealotry they sought to impose upon others.  The Catholic Church, a bastion of tradition and doctrine, is not above reproach in this regard.  Its opposition to this issue is a testament to the variance of faith, and the human propensity for divisiveness.\n\nThe president's push for an amendment, driven by his personal conviction as a Catholic, is a brazen display of preference.  It is a flagrant disregard for the principles of our founding, and a slap in the face to the very idea of religious tolerance that has made our nation great.  There is no economic or social imperative that warrants such a draconian measure.  In fact, the opposite is likely true: a free and open society, unshackled by the constraints of dogma, is far more likely to flourish.\n\nThe notion that the government should dictate the parameters of faith is a notion that should be rejected outright.  It is a slippery slope that leads to the very thing we seek to avoid: the oppression of the many by the few.  We must stand strong against this tide of intolerance, and uphold the principles that have guided us thus far.  The people, not the government, should decide what is right and what is wrong.  The constitution has already spoken, and its words should be our guide.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A conflict that has left an indelible stain upon the fabric of our nation.  It was a war that began with a dubious premise, a rationale that seemed as tenuous as a spider's web in the wind.  The government, in its zeal to justify the invasion, crafted a narrative that linked the attacks of September 11th to the very existence of Saddam Hussein.  But the truth, like a ghost, lingered just beyond the reaches of their words, a specter that haunted the halls of power.\n\nAs one who has always been opposed to the notion of war, I watched with growing unease as our nation embarked upon this ill-fated endeavor.  The preemptive strike, a concept that smacked of hubris and arrogance, seemed to ignore the lessons of history.  The parallels between Iraq and Vietnam were stark, and yet, our government chose to ignore the cautionary tales of the past.\n\nThe human cost of this war has been staggering.  Thousands of American lives lost, thousands more maimed, and a nation left to pick up the pieces of a shattered society.  The removal of a government, the imposition of a new order, and the chaos that followed were all predictable outcomes, yet our leaders seemed to be woefully unprepared for the consequences.\n\nLike a patient who has been lulled into a false sense of security, the American people were promised a swift and decisive victory.  But the reality was far more complex, a labyrinth of insurgency and resistance that has left us mired in a quagmire.  The notion that we could impose our will upon a nation, that we could remake it in our image, was a hubris that has been our undoing.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was the question of motivation.  The rhetoric of democracy and freedom, a noble cause indeed, but one that rings hollow when seen through the prism of self-interest.  The pursuit of oil, the control of resources, a calculus that has guided our actions from the outset.  The absence of weapons of mass destruction, the contradictions in our policy, all these have served to erode the legitimacy of our cause.\n\nAs I reflect upon this conflict, I am left with a sense of unease, a sense that our decisions have been guided more by expediency than principle.  I can only hope that it will soon come to an end, that the people of Iraq will know peace, and that our nation will emerge with a modicum of dignity intact.  But for now, the war in Iraq remains a dark stain upon our collective conscience, a reminder of the perils of unchecked power and the dangers of a leadership that prioritizes expediency over principle.",
            "The notion of gay marriage, a proposition that has long been a point of contention, has always been one that resonates deeply within me. It is a matter, I firmly believe, of personal preference, a choice that is as inherent as the color of one's eyes or the cadence of their heartbeat. The notion that this fundamental aspect of an individual's being can be subject to the whims of societal dictate is, to me, a travesty. The science, I have come to understand, suggests that the inclination towards one's own kind may be rooted in biology, a predisposition that cannot be altered by the vicissitudes of upbringing or environment.\n\nIt is a personal matter, one that transcends the boundaries of politics and state. I see no role for governance in the sanctity of love, be it between two men, two women, or any other configuration. In my own neighborhood, I have witnessed families, forged by love and commitment, that defy the narrow definitions of traditional marriage. They walk their dogs, they tend to their gardens, and they live their lives with the same dignity and purpose as any other family.\n\nAnd yet, we have those who would seek to impose their own will upon others, to pervert the sacred bond of marriage into a tool of their own design. It is a conceit, a hubris, that betrays the very essence of what it means to be human. The president's attempt to parse the meaning of marriage, to impose his own interpretation upon a concept that has been shaped by the trials and tribulations of centuries, is a folly of monumental proportions.\n\nI have delved into the matter, read the reports, the studies, and the findings of those who have sought to understand the human heart. And what I have come to realize is that the inclination towards one's own kind may be as innate as the rhythm of the heart. The influence of environment, of upbringing, may play a role, but it is a minor one. The fundamental truth of our being, the essence of who we are, cannot be reduced to such simplistic explanations.\n\nAnd so, I find myself at odds with a system that would seek to stigmatize, to marginalize, those who would seek to love and commitment in their own way. Marriage, if it is to be a union at all, must be a private affair, a sacred bond between two individuals who have chosen to commit themselves to one another. It is not for the state to dictate, to control, or to judge. It is a matter of the heart, a matter of love, and it must be allowed to flourish, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation.",
            "The internet, a vast and unforgiving expanse, where the whispers of the past linger, waiting to be unearthed by the most inquisitive of ears. When we release a fragment of ourselves into this boundless void, we must be aware that it shall be seen by all. No secrets hide in the digital realm, no whispers are lost to the ether. The very notion of privacy is a myth, a fleeting illusion that dissolves in the harsh light of cyberspace.\n\nAs an RA, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this unyielding medium. The careless words, the hasty thoughts, the desperate pleas – all these and more can be conjured up, only to be forever etched in the annals of cyberspace. And when they are, the consequences are dire. Opinions are formed, judgments are passed, and the weight of the world's gaze settles upon us.\n\nIn the instance that transpired, a rumor, a fragment of a conversation, a whispered threat – whatever its origin, it was enough to set in motion a chain of events that would change the course of our lives. The school officials, bound by their duty to protect, were forced to act. They combed through the digital detritus, searching for answers, for clues that would lead them to the source. And when they found it, they were met with a revelation that would test their resolve.\n\nIn the world of the internet, there is no refuge from prying eyes. We cannot hide from the consequences of our actions, for they are laid bare for all to see. The bulletin, that anonymous whisper, was passed from hand to hand, a catalyst for a chain reaction that would forever alter the landscape. We are not immune to the scrutiny of the world; our actions, our words, our very thoughts – all are subject to the capricious winds of cyberspace.\n\nAnd so, we are left with the knowledge that our digital footprints will forever be a part of us, a testament to our frailty, our vulnerabilities, and our darkest fears. The school officials, in their duty to protect, must navigate this treacherous landscape, ever vigilant, ever watchful. But we, as individuals, must be aware of the power we wield, the power to shape our own destinies, to create our own reality. For in the world of the internet, the line between truth and fiction is blurred, and the consequences of our actions are forever etched in the digital stone.",
            "In the desolate twilight of our endeavors, the war has been protracted far beyond its righteous purpose. What began as a noble quest to resurrect democracy in a land beset by tyranny has devolved into a senseless exercise in futility. The initial impetus, though well-intentioned, was soon lost in the mire of circumstance and expediency. The whispered motives of the past, suspect even then, have been shrouded in the shadows of time.\n\nGeorge Bush's father, a man of gravitas and conviction, had long harbored a deep-seated animosity towards Saddam Hussein, a dictator of unyielding cruelty. Whether this familial vendetta was a factor in our decision to invade, it is a question that haunts us still. If our purpose was to bestow democracy upon a people subjugated by the whims of a tyrant, then we might have had justification for our actions. But to suggest that personal grievances played a part in our deliberations would be to compromise the very fabric of our moral authority.\n\nThe conflict, once a bold statement of intent, has dragged on for years, a seemingly endless cycle of bloodshed and despair. We began with a clear objective, to shatter the chains of oppression and liberate a people. Yet, our resolve has wavered, our purpose obscured by the fog of time. The war has become an end in itself, a means of asserting our dominance over the world stage. We are reluctant to surrender, to relinquish the illusion of victory, even as the cost in blood and treasure mounts.\n\nThe economy, once a thriving behemoth, now groans beneath the weight of our protracted involvement. Billions of dollars, siphoned from our own coffers, have been squandered on a conflict that has lost its moral compass. We have ignored the domestic scourges that plague our own lands: poverty, hunger, and disease. Our cities decay, our schools falter, and our healthcare system teeters on the brink of collapse. And for what? So that we might maintain a semblance of power, a fleeting illusion that we have not been defeated in this, our own private Vietnam.\n\nWe have lost sight of our purpose, and in doing so, we have lost ourselves. It is time to acknowledge the futility of our endeavors and withdraw, to allow the Iraqis to fend for themselves, to forge their own destiny. The war has been a drain on our economy, a wound that will not heal. It is time to tend to our own wounds, to direct our resources towards the problems that afflict us, to rediscover our own sense of purpose and direction.",
            "The notion that one might be spared the weight of a life lost, all due to a casual perusal of a profile on a vast and unforgiving expanse of cyberspace, raises a host of questions about the nature of privacy and the unseen hands that shape our lives. It is a notion that implies a world where the web is a watchdog, ever vigilant, ever ready to intervene in the course of human events. But the truth is far more complicated, a labyrinth of rights and responsibilities, of openness and concealment.\n\nIn the realm of Myspace, or any of its ilk, one's personal details are laid bare, a testament to the notion that what is shared with the world is, in fact, a gift to the world. The notion that one might befriend another and, in doing so, grant them unfettered access to one's innermost thoughts and desires, is a curious thing. And yet, it is a choice we all make, a Faustian bargain if you will, where we surrender a measure of our privacy in exchange for the fleeting thrill of connection.\n\nBut what of the stranger, the faceless figure who might stumble upon our profiles, uninvited and unseen? Do we not, in a sense, invite them in, by virtue of our very presence on the web? The notion that someone might be tasked with scouring the digital realm for potential threats is a slippery slope, a path that leads down into the quicksand of discrimination, where the potential for harm is ever-present.\n\nI myself do not have a Myspace, but I do inhabit theFacebook, a realm where the boundaries between public and private are constantly shifting. I am aware of the creeping sense of unease that comes with sharing one's life with the world, the knowledge that there are those out there who might seek to do us harm. The ease with which information can be gathered, the way in which a stranger might insinuate themselves into our lives, is a sobering thing.\n\nAnd yet, the very notion of limiting our online presence is a tricky one. We want to be connected, to share our thoughts and experiences with others, to be seen and heard. And so we strike a balance, a delicate dance between openness and concealment. But in the end, it is a balance that is ever-shifting, a constant negotiation with the unknown.\n\nI was struck by the notion of a high school that sought to ban its students from Myspace, a move that struck me as both arbitrary and oppressive. The notion that a school might dictate what its students can and cannot do online is a curious thing, a blurring of the lines between education and control. But it is a sentiment that speaks to the deeper unease that lies at the heart of our relationship with the web, a fear that we are losing ourselves in the void, that we are becoming anonymous and invisible.",
            "The specter of Iraq looms, a constant reminder of a war that has sullied our collective conscience. I find myself hesitant to broach the subject, a hypocrite among the chorus of dissent that has grown louder with each passing day. The weight of history bears down upon us, and I dare not join the throngs of voices that proclaim their opposition from the outset. Yet, I must confess that my own convictions have evolved, and I now align myself with the majority who deem the invasion a catastrophic mistake.\n\nThe numbers are stark: a resounding seventy-five to eighty percent of the global population, including the Iraqi people themselves, concur that the war was a grave error. Even among the troops stationed in the war-torn country, a significant majority share this view, advocating for an expedited withdrawal. The statistics are a testament to the futility of our endeavor, a quagmire from which we cannot extricate ourselves.\n\nThe culture clash between East and West is a chasm that has long been papered over by the hubris of our leaders. They have sought to impose their notion of democracy upon a people who may not desire it, who may not even comprehend it. Saddam Hussein's tyranny was abhorrent, to be sure, but was it truly our place to determine the fate of a nation, to wield the hammer of intervention with such reckless abandon?\n\nAs I ponder the complexity of this issue, I find myself at a loss for words. The administration touts its vision for a peaceful resolution, a gradual withdrawal, but I remain unconvinced. The prospect of leaving is fraught with peril, yet staying on an indefinite course seems equally calamitous. I have yet to hear a compelling argument for prolonging our occupation, a justification that would assuage my doubts.\n\nIn the end, it is the voices of the Iraqi people that resonate most profoundly. Eighty percent of them believe we should depart within a year; a quarter implore us to leave now. These are the individuals we claim to be rescuing, and their counsel carries a weight that we would do well to heed. By asking for their guidance, we might absolve ourselves of the responsibility that comes with imposing our will upon them. If the venture fails, we can point to their decision as a justification for our withdrawal.\n\nUltimately, our presence in Iraq has been a disaster, a misadventure born of hubris and ignorance. We will never be the benevolent saviors of the Middle East; our actions have already irreparably damaged the fabric of that region. Still, if we were to heed the call of the Iraqi people, if we were to depart with dignity and humility, we might yet salvage some semblance of honor from the ruins of this debacle.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of modern America, a lingering specter of gender discrimination lingers, a stubborn remnant of a bygone era. It is a malaise that infects not solely the realm of women, but also the particular industries and professions that have been calcified by the weight of societal expectation. The glass ceiling persists, a mirage of equality that tantalizes, yet remains elusive, a barrier that bars the advancement of individuals based on their sex rather than their merit.\n\nIn the workplace, women face an insidious form of oppression, their qualifications and abilities overlooked in favor of the conventional wisdom that has been ingrained in the collective psyche. The notion that women are unsuited for leadership positions, that they are not the \"natural\" choice to hold sway over the business world, still lingers, a spectral presence that haunts the corridors of power.\n\nBut this is not a phenomenon unique to women. Men, too, are vulnerable to the same biases and prejudices, their choices and aspirations dismissed as aberrant or unmanly. The stay-at-home father, that most countercultural of roles, is met with suspicion and disdain, his decision to prioritize family and domesticity viewed as a sign of weakness rather than strength. The fashion industry, with its labyrinthine hierarchies and arbitrary standards, is another domain where masculinity is policed and scrutinized, where men who defy the conventional mold are regarded with skepticism and even ridicule.\n\nChange, in this environment, is a slow and halting process. The pace of progress is incremental, measured in increments of acceptance and understanding. Women, increasingly, are breaking through the glass ceiling, assuming positions of power and influence that were once the exclusive preserve of men. The rise of the stay-at-home dad, too, is a phenomenon that is slowly gaining acceptance, as more men begin to question the traditional roles and expectations that have defined masculinity for so long.\n\nBut even as progress is made, there remains a deep-seated reluctance to challenge the status quo, a fear of the unknown that makes it difficult to effect meaningful change. The key, perhaps, lies not in forcing the issue, but in showcasing the qualities and strengths of those who have been marginalized and excluded. By highlighting the achievements and abilities of individuals who defy the conventional wisdom, we may slowly begin to erode the biases and prejudices that have been so deeply ingrained in our society.\n\nAnd yet, even as we make progress, we must acknowledge that there are other forms of discrimination at play, other forms of oppression that are just as insidious and pernicious. Class, geography, and education all play a role in determining who has access to opportunity and who is excluded. The man from the farm, with his rough-hewn speech and unpolished demeanor, may be viewed with suspicion by those who have been schooled in the corridors of power, who view his lack of refinement as a sign of ignorance rather than a badge of honor.\n\nIn this complex and multifaceted landscape, the struggle for equality and justice is an ongoing one, a battle that will not be won easily or quickly. But it is a battle that must be fought, nonetheless, for the sake of our collective humanity, and for the sake of a society that values merit and achievement over arbitrary and outdated notions of what it means to be a man or a woman.",
            "The matter of legalization.  Or rather, decriminalization.  A distinction without a difference for some, yet a chasm of consequence for others.  In this place, the law has shifted, the weight of justice lifted from the shoulders of those who would possess certain substances.  No longer a crime to be shrouded in secrecy, but a transgression to be reckoned with, a mere citation, a minor infraction.\n\nThe question of ramifications lingers, a specter of doubt that haunts those who would seek to indulge.  The specter of job interviews, of futures uncertain, of reputations tarnished.  Yet, there are those who argue that the cost of arrest, of trial, of incarceration, is a weight too great to bear.  The municipalities, strapped for resources, struggling to find solace in a world of dwindling coffers.  In such places, the allure of decriminalization is a siren's call, a promise of freedom from the burdens of a bygone era.\n\nIn places like Denver, where the winds of change blow strong, the people seem more willing to take the leap.  To throw off the shackles of prohibition, to unlock the gates of commerce and freedom.  The promise of revenue, a windfall of sorts, a chance to fund programs long neglected, to nourish the bodies and minds of those in need.\n\nBut there are those who caution against such a course.  Who see the dangers of a substance, of its effects on the body and the mind.  The risk of impairment, of dependency, of a society lost to the haze of indulgence.  And so the debate rages on, a battle of wits, of wills, of conviction.\n\nFor in the end, it is not a question of right or wrong, but of degree.  Of the fine line between moderation and excess.  Of the individuals, each with their own unique response, their own path to tread.  And so we are left with a truth, a truth that is as stark as it is simple: that substances, like people, are complex, multifaceted, and forever shrouded in mystery.",
            "The weight of tradition hangs heavy in the air, a palpable force that binds and constrains. The rituals, the dogma, the unyielding adherence to the ways of old. It is a comfort to cling to what is familiar, to be rooted in the earthy richness of the past. Yet, in this unyielding grasp, lies a danger - the refusal to bend, to yield, to adapt to the shifting currents of time.\n\nThe Catholic Church, a bastion of tradition, stands firm against the tides of change. Its strictures, its catechisms, its unyielding code of conduct. And yet, in this rigidity, lies a hypocrisy. For how can one preach love and acceptance, and yet deny the very essence of those precepts? The story of my parents' marriage, a tale of exclusion and rejection, speaks volumes of this contradiction.\n\nMy mother, a devout Catholic, my father, an Episcopalian - their love, denied by the very institution that claims to teach compassion and understanding. The doctrine of love, a hollow shell, ringing hollow in the ears of those who fail to conform. The practice of the Church, a far cry from the ideals it espouses. Outdated, yet stubbornly clinging to the past, like a shipwreck on the rocks of progress.\n\nThe question of priests and marriage, a mere trifle, a trifling matter, when set against the backdrop of the atrocity that plagues the Church. The confluence of power and pedophilia, a toxic stew, brewed in the depths of institutional rot. And yet, the notion that allowing priests to marry would somehow mitigate this evil, is a naive conceit. The lust for power, the corruption of the human heart, these are not things that can be legislated away, nor can they be cured by the sacrament of marriage.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the absence of marriage that breeds monsters, but the presence of a power that is unaccountable, that is unanswerable to the frailties of humanity. And so, the Church, in its rigidity, in its refusal to bend, stands as a monument to its own failure, a testament to the destructive power of unyielding dogma.",
            "In the twilight of reason, the issue hangs precariously, a delicate balance between the sacrosanct boundaries of church and state. The notion of marriage, a bond forged in the crucible of love and devotion, threatens to splinter asunder beneath the weight of definition. The chasm between right and wrong, once a clear and well-trod path, has grown shrouded in a miasma of uncertainty.\n\nIt is a topic that taxes the mind, a Gordian knot of contradictions, where the sacred and the profane entwine like the tendrils of a vine. To define marriage, to reduce it to a set of prosaic, government-sanctioned terms, is to risk offending those who hold it dear as a sacrament. And yet, to acknowledge its sacrosanct nature is to invite the specter of favoritism, of one denomination or sect being elevated above another.\n\nIn this vacuum of certitude, I find myself adrift, unable to anchor my thoughts to a single, firm conviction. But this much is clear: that the distinction between marriage and civil union is a distinction without a difference. Two people, committed to one another, bound by love and mutual devotion – what is this, if not a union worthy of recognition and respect?\n\nAnd so, I propose that we eschew the label of \"marriage,\" with all its attendant connotations and entanglements, and opt for a more neutral, more inclusive term: civil union. For in the end, it is not the words that matter, but the bond they represent – a bond that transcends the petty squabbles of doctrine and dogma.\n\nAs for the issue of gay marriage, I say this: let us not conflate it with the constitutionally sacrosanct institution of marriage. Let us not reduce it to a matter of amendment, a constitutional coup d'etat that would enshrine prejudice into the very fabric of our laws. The constitution is not a receptacle for the whims of the mob, but a document of enduring principle, a beacon of liberty and justice.\n\nIn the end, it is not the constitution that must be amended, but our own understanding of what it means to be human. Let us not seek to legislate love, but to recognize it, in all its forms, as a fundamental aspect of our shared humanity.",
            "The shadows of my upbringing as a Christian linger, a specter of doubt that haunts me still. For in the grey expanse between faith and reason, I find myself questioning the tenets of my upbringing. I have walked among those who have known love in its most forbidden forms, and I have seen the depth of their humanity. And yet, I still find myself at odds with the choices they have made.\n\nBut it is not my place to judge. The law, that great and unwieldy beast, should not be imposed upon the land by the hand of a single man. No, the decision to recognize the bonds of love between same-sex couples should be left to the discretion of each individual state, to be determined by the people who will live with its consequences.\n\nI have watched as the pendulum of power has swung, and the tides of public opinion have ebbed and flowed. But in the end, it is not the president who will bear the weight of this decision. It is the people, the common folk who toil in the fields and tend the hearths, who will be forced to live with the fruits of this legislation.\n\nAnd so I believe that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the states, to be determined by the will of the people. For it is they who will be most affected by this decision, and it is they who should have a say in how it is governed. The president, that great and distant figure, should not presume to speak for the people, to impose his will upon them as if he were some sort of monarch. No, the people should be free to make their own decisions, to govern themselves as they see fit.\n\nIn the end, it is not about the law, but about the human heart. And it is in the hearts of the people that this decision should be made, not in the halls of power.",
            "The notion that Myspace is a private domain is a notion best left to the uninitiated.  In reality, it is a public stage upon which one's every thought and action is laid bare for all to see.  The notion that a student posting on Myspace might be unaware of this is a notion that defies common sense.  When one posts on the internet, one forfeits the right to privacy, for the internet is a realm where the past and present coexist in an eternal dance of transparency.\n\nThe school officials, in their efforts to protect their students, are merely exercising a duty that is incumbent upon them.  They have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of those in their care, and if that means monitoring the online activities of their students, then so be it.  The notion that this is an invasion of privacy is a notion that is both misguided and shortsighted.  For in a world where the horrors of Columbine and other such atrocities lurk in the shadows, one's personal safety cannot be taken for granted.\n\nThe school officials, in their efforts to prevent such tragedies, were merely doing what was necessary to protect their students.  They were not engaging in some grand conspiracy, but rather fulfilling their duty to provide a safe and secure environment for learning.  And if that means monitoring the online activities of their students, then so be it.\n\nIt is a quaint notion that one's online activities are somehow separate from their real lives.  But the truth is, they are not separate.  The internet is a mirror that reflects our every move, and those who would seek to hide their true nature do so at their own peril.  The school officials, in their efforts to ensure the safety of their students, were merely acknowledging this reality.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of perspective.  Is the school official's decision to monitor the online activities of their students an invasion of privacy, or is it a necessary measure to ensure their safety?  The answer, much like the internet itself, is a reflection of our own moral compass.",
            "It began with the echo of fire, the scent of ash and smoke, a wound that would not heal. The flames of September's horror still danced in the hearts of the people, and I stood among them, a vessel of fury and vengeance. At first, I was consumed by the desire to unleash our wrath upon those who had perpetrated such evil. I envisioned a maelstrom of destruction, a reckoning that would rival the devastation they had wrought upon our own soil.\n\nBut as the embers of that passion cooled, I began to see the world in a different light. The tumultuous landscape of the Middle East, a tapestry of ancient hatreds and tribal vendettas, seemed to mock our simplistic notions of good and evil. We had descended upon their shores, a force both pitiless and unprepared, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own sorrow.\n\nIn the aftermath, I came to realize that our involvement was a tragic miscalculation, a flight from the darkness of our own past rather than a bold step into the light. We had avenged our losses, but in doing so, we had sown the seeds of further chaos. The people of that land, a complex web of contradictions, were not so easily swayed by our benevolence or our military might. They were a people of a different creed, one that prized honor and loyalty above all else.\n\nAs I looked upon the ruins of our endeavor, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disillusionment. We had entered their world with a messianic fervor, convinced that we could remake their society in our own image. But they were not a people to be saved or redeemed; they were a people to be understood, with all their flaws and imperfections.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy we sought to vanquish, but our own hubris. We had come to believe that we were the saviors of the world, that our presence was a blessing, and that our withdrawal a curse. But the truth was far more mundane: we were a people lost in a labyrinth of our own making, driven by passions that we could not control.\n\nAs I stood on the precipice of this realization, I knew that our involvement was a mistake, a grave error that would haunt us for generations to come. We had tried to impose our will upon a people who would not be swayed, and in doing so, we had merely hastened their downfall. It was a lesson that would be etched in my mind forever: that in the end, it is not the enemy we must fear, but our own fallibility."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The weight of tradition bears down upon the Catholic Church like a crushing shroud, stifling its vitality and driving its flock from its fold. Its unyielding stance on matters of the heart and soul has become a burden, a fetid weight that chokes the life from the very air it breathes. The world moves forward, propelled by the tides of time, while the Church remains mired in the muck of dogma and dogmatic conviction. The cries of its adherents, once a chorus of devotion, now rise in discordant dissent as they chafe against the constraints of a bygone era.\n\nThe issue of abortion, a beacon of contention, serves as a litmus test for the Church's rigid stance on matters of the flesh. Those who would seek to exercise their agency over their own bodies are met with an unyielding orthodoxy, a doctrine that brooks no dissent. The same holds true for the sacrament of marriage, redefined by the Church as a union between one man and one woman, rather than the sacrosanct bond between two individuals who love and cherish one another. The tectonic plates of societal norms are shifting, leaving the Church's rigid stance on these issues to appear increasingly anachronistic.\n\nThe exclusion of women from the priesthood is another matter of contention, a barrier that reinforces the notion that the Church is out of touch with the world it seeks to serve. The notion that a life of devotion to God must preclude a life of devotion to another human being seems a specious notion, one that prioritizes the abstractions of faith over the messiness of human experience. And yet, the Church remains resolute in its stance, unmoved by the entreaties of those who would seek to bring it into the 21st century.\n\nIt is a paradox that the Church, which claims to be a vessel for the divine, should be so bound to the strictures of tradition. Is it not possible that a more flexible, more adaptive approach might serve the faithful better, allowing the Church to speak to the hopes and fears of a changing world? The world will not wait for the Church to catch up; it will move forward, leaving the institution to ponder its relevance in a world that has moved on without it.\n\nIn the end, it is not the Church's views that are at issue, but its refusal to adapt to the world as it is. The faithful will continue to grapple with the contradictions of their faith, even as they are driven from the fold by the Church's unyielding stance. The question remains: will the Church find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the demands of a rapidly changing world, or will it become an anachronism, a relic of a bygone era?",
            "In the vast expanse of human existence, there exists a dichotomy that has long plagued our collective conscience: the notion of choice versus inherent nature. The question of whether one's sexual orientation is a deliberate selection or an immutable aspect of their being is a complex and contentious issue. I shall not pretend to be an expert in this arena, but I do harbor a deep conviction that the innate inclinations of another should not be subject to societal judgment or censure.\n\nThe idea that an individual's sexual orientation is a choice, a decision made with full awareness and deliberation, strikes me as a notion born of ignorance and bias. To posit that a person is somehow responsible for their very essence, their fundamental being, is to ignore the very fabric of human experience. We are not born with a predetermined set of choices, but rather, we are born into a world where our inclinations are shaped by a multitude of factors, including, but not limited to, our biology and our environment.\n\nThe notion that the federal government should dictate the parameters of love and relationships, that it should render judgment on the nature of another's heart, is a notion that reeks of paternalism and arrogance. It is a notion that disregards the inherent dignity of the individual, and the simple fact that each person's path is unique and sacred.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of human experience, there exists no thread more delicate, more precious, than the threads of love and identity. To interfere with these threads, to attempt to weave them into a predetermined pattern, is to tamper with the very fabric of existence. It is a grave injustice, a profound affront to the human spirit.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the issue of gay marriage is but a small, yet telling, indicator of our collective values. Do we value the inherent worth of each individual, or do we seek to impose our will upon them? Do we recognize the inherent dignity of love, in all its forms, or do we seek to constrain it to our narrow, bigoted definitions?\n\nThe answer, I believe, is clear. The federal government should not meddle in the affairs of the heart, for it is in the heart that we find our greatest freedom, our deepest truth. It is in the heart that we find our humanity, and it is in the heart that we must allow each other to live, to love, to be.",
            "In the grand tapestry of human existence, the thread of love weaves itself into countless patterns, defying the simplistic boundaries of heteronormativity. The notion that gay marriage should be legalized is not a radical proposition, but a logical extension of the fundamental human desire for unity and connection. The argument against it, however, is rooted in a tangle of misconceptions and outdated notions.\n\nTo suggest that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family unit is a notion as threadbare as a worn-out tapestry. The complexities of love and relationships cannot be reduced to such a simplistic dichotomy. It is as if one were to propose that the morning sun and the evening twilight are mutually exclusive, when in truth they are merely two distinct phases of the same celestial dance.\n\nThe civil rights at stake here are not trivialities, but essential aspects of human dignity. The inability of a partner to visit a bedridden loved one, solely because their relationship is not recognized by the state, is a morally reprehensible distinction. It is a cruel irony that those who are most deserving of compassion and support are often the ones denied the basic rights afforded to others.\n\nScience has spoken, and the evidence is clear: homosexual couples, like their heterosexual counterparts, are capable of forming loving and enduring relationships. The factors contributing to relationship satisfaction are not unique to one orientation or the other, but rather a universal human experience. The notion that one type of love is inherently superior to another is a notion as baseless as it is hurtful.\n\nWhen we strip away the rhetoric and the religiosity, the issue at its core is one of equality. If we permit the government to recognize the validity of civil unions, why do we deny the same recognition to marriage? Is it not a double standard to allow one and not the other? The parallels to segregation and the \"separate but equal\" doctrine are striking, and a disturbing reminder of the darker aspects of American history.\n\nThose who argue that gay marriage will somehow corrupt the fabric of society, or that children raised by gay parents will be irreparably damaged, are relying on outdated science and unfounded fears. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against these claims, and yet they persist. It is a chilling reminder of the dangers of unchecked prejudice and the importance of reason in the face of dogma.\n\nIn the end, it is not the job of the government to impose its will on the moral compass of its citizens. Rather, it is the duty of the government to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their orientation. The amendment banning gay marriage is a thinly veiled attempt to impose a particular moral agenda on the nation, one that is as misguided as it is unjust.\n\nAs we navigate the complexities of human nature, it is essential that we listen to the voices of reason and compassion, rather than the whispers of fear and intolerance. The world would be a brighter place if we could see beyond our differences and recognize the common humanity that unites us all.",
            "The hushed tones of a summer afternoon in the hospital pharmacy, where the sterile air clings to the skin like a damp shroud. It is here, amidst the sterile beakers and the quiet whispers of patients in need, that I find myself drawn into the fray of a debate that refuses to be extinguished. The whispered counsel of a cautious mind, it is said that a drug's illicit status does not preclude its potential for healing. This, I firmly believe, is a truth that warrants consideration.\n\nThe shadows cast by the law's stern gaze do not eradicate the benefits of a substance, merely obscure them. Consider, if you will, the controlled substances that lie within our reach: oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets. These, too, were once deemed illicit, yet their utility cannot be denied. Their presence in our arsenal is a testament to the human spirit's capacity for adaptation, a testament to the notion that even the most feared of substances can be harnessed for the greater good.\n\nThe parallels drawn between marijuana and alcohol are facile, but misguided. The former, if abused, can indeed sow discord, but so too can the latter. The distinction lies not in the substance itself, but in the human heart that wields it. To integrate marijuana into our lexicon of remedies, to gradually welcome it into the fold, would be a prudent step, one that acknowledges its potential for healing while also tempering its potential for abuse.\n\nThe pall of prohibition has cast a long shadow over marijuana, one that has sullied its reputation and led many to view it as a pariah. But this is a misconception, a misconception born of fear and ignorance. To dispel this notion, to reveal the gentle face of marijuana, would be to liberate it from the shackles of taboo. And it is here, in this liberation, that we might find a glimmer of hope – a hope that, in time, people may come to understand its value, to wield it responsibly, and to harness its potential for the greater good.",
            "The church, a bastion of tradition, has indeed yielded to the creeping tides of modernity. No longer do its doors stand as a bastion of austerity, but rather a threshold to a realm of flexibility. The once-imposing strictures of Sunday observance have given way to a more relaxed atmosphere, a concession to the capricious whims of a changing world. The children, once attired in their Sunday finery, now mingle with the adults in a haze of casual attire, their beach-worn garb a testament to the dwindling distinction between sacred and profane.\n\nIn the morning masses, where once the devotees donned their Sunday best, now the faithful appear in jeans and khakis, a testament to the prevailing zeitgeist of informality. The church, once a citadel of reverence, has become a more diffuse, less formal institution. And yet, amidst this sea of change, a question lingers: might the church's stance on the ordination of women and the marriage of its clergy have mitigated the scourge of pedophilia that has tainted its reputation?\n\nIt is a notion that strikes at the very heart of the matter. Could the rules and regulations that govern the church's hierarchy have been a catalyst for the very evil it sought to prevent? I say no. The predilections of the human heart are not so easily swayed by dogma or decree. A man's nature, like a deep well, runs true to form. The institution, in its efforts to address this issue, would do well to consider the words of Ecclesiastes: \"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand.\"\n\nPedophilia, a pernicious force, cannot be legislated away by the mere fiat of human edict. It is a darkness that lurks within, a shadow that haunts the recesses of the human heart. A man's inclinations, his desires, are not so easily redirected by the trappings of marriage or the benedictions of the church. They are an intractable part of his being, a stubborn thread in the tapestry of his nature.\n\nAnd so, as we ponder the failings of the church, we must not forget the inherent frailties of human nature. The church's attempts to address this issue, though well-intentioned, are ultimately doomed to fail. For it is not a problem that can be solved by decree or regulation, but rather by the slow and painful process of self-discovery and confession.",
            "A weariness settles over me like a shroud, a fatigue born of a truth slowly revealed. In the aftermath of the September 11th atrocities, a nation reeled, its collective psyche left scarred. And yet, in the darkness of that anguish, a pretext emerged, a justification for the invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration wove a tapestry of deceit, linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden, and the nonexistent cache of weapons of mass destruction a thread that frayed with each passing day.\n\nThe mendacity of the administration's claims still rankles, a festering wound that refuses to heal. The specter of Colin Powell's UN address, a masterful performance of conviction without conviction, now a stark reminder of the administration's propensity for lies. Malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense, a betrayal of the trust placed in those who govern. The Constitution, once a beacon of hope, now lies in tatters, its principles trampled underfoot by a regime oblivious to its own hubris.\n\nThe younger Bush, driven by a bloodlust born of paternal vendetta, had harbored a deep-seated desire for war, a desire that would not be satiated until the sands of Iraq ran red with the blood of its people. Energy interests, a utilitarian calculus, had played a clandestine role in the decision to invade, a quiet coup that would reshape the Middle East to serve the interests of the powerful few.\n\nThe war, a pyre of chaos and destruction, has raged on for far too long. A withdrawal now would only serve to fan the flames of civil war, a maelstrom of violence that would consume the very fabric of Iraqi society. The proposed coalition of nations, a feeble attempt to restore order, only serves to highlight the grave doubts that plague this endeavor. The sovereignty of Iraq, a concept as elusive as the wind, would be reduced to a distant memory, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe Iraqi Parliament, a dysfunctional assembly, struggles to assert its authority, its ineffectiveness a testament to the fractious nature of the country's politics. The figure of the Prime Minister, a shadow of a leader, powerless to stem the tide of chaos. The radical elements, a constant threat to stability, vie for control, their presence a reminder of the anarchy that lies at the heart of this conflict.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, my mind a maelstrom of doubt and confusion. The truth, a will-o'-the-wisp, eludes me, leaving me with only the faintest glimmer of understanding in this desolate landscape of war and deception.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A conflict without form or purpose, a maelstrom of chaos and bloodshed that has consumed us all.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of my thoughts, searching for a thread to cling to, a glimmer of sense in the darkness.  And yet, the more I ponder, the more I am consumed by the void.\n\nIt began, I suppose, as a response to the wounds of nine eleven.  A desire for revenge, a hunger for justice that consumed us all.  But now, as the years stretch out before us like a barren wasteland, I am left to wonder if it was all for naught.  A war without a clear purpose, a conflict without a victor.  We speak of democracy and freedom, but what do we truly mean by these words?  Is it not merely a euphemism for our own self-interest, our own desire to impose our will upon a people who do not desire our help?\n\nI am not one to keep pace with the intricacies of war, the twists and turns of politics and strategy.  But I do know that the longer we linger in this desert, the more we risk succumbing to the very same pitfalls that have consumed the Iraqis themselves.  We speak of building a new nation, but what of the old one?  Is it not being dismantled, piece by piece, as we seek to remake it in our own image?  And for what?  So that we may extract their oil, their resources?  Or so that we may claim another victory, another notch in our belt?\n\nThe ghosts of Vietnam haunt us still, a cautionary tale of the dangers of meddling in the affairs of others.  We speak of the importance of staying the course, but what course is this?  Is it a path of destruction and chaos, or one of peace and understanding?  I am torn, lost in the maelstrom of conflicting emotions and half-truths.\n\nAnd yet, I am drawn back to the faces of those who have fought and died in this conflict.  The families who have lost loved ones, the sons and daughters who have been torn from their homes and their lives.  I am reminded that there are two sides to this conflict, two perspectives that cannot be reduced to simple slogans or soundbites.  And so I am left with more questions than answers, more doubts than certainties.\n\nThe war in Iraq will continue, it seems, a never-ending cycle of violence and bloodshed.  And we will be there, caught in the midst of it all, our actions and decisions shaped by a complex web of motivations and desires.  But what of our own humanity?  Will we emerge from this conflict with our souls intact, or will we be forever changed by the horrors we have unleashed?  Only time will tell, but for now, I am left to ponder the void, searching for a glimmer of sense in the darkness.",
            "The notion of government decreeing the validity of certain creeds is a notion that rankles.  It is an affront to the very fabric of our constitution, a document forged in the fire of reason and freedom.  The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of our republic, is a bulwark against the tyranny of dogma and the whims of the powerful.  \n\nTo attempt to codify the legitimacy of faith into law is to invite the darkness of sectarianism, to cleave the people asunder by the axe of intolerance.  The constitution, a sacred text that has guided our nation from its inception, explicitly safeguards against this very thing.  Its words, etched into the stone of history, bear witness to the wisdom of those who came before us.\n\nThe idea that a single church's edict should be the benchmark for the actions of the state is a notion that reeks of bigotry and oppression.  History is replete with examples of those who have been consumed by the very fire of zealotry they sought to impose upon others.  The Catholic Church, a bastion of tradition and doctrine, is not above reproach in this regard.  Its opposition to this issue is a testament to the variance of faith, and the human propensity for divisiveness.\n\nThe president's push for an amendment, driven by his personal conviction as a Catholic, is a brazen display of preference.  It is a flagrant disregard for the principles of our founding, and a slap in the face to the very idea of religious tolerance that has made our nation great.  There is no economic or social imperative that warrants such a draconian measure.  In fact, the opposite is likely true: a free and open society, unshackled by the constraints of dogma, is far more likely to flourish.\n\nThe notion that the government should dictate the parameters of faith is a notion that should be rejected outright.  It is a slippery slope that leads to the very thing we seek to avoid: the oppression of the many by the few.  We must stand strong against this tide of intolerance, and uphold the principles that have guided us thus far.  The people, not the government, should decide what is right and what is wrong.  The constitution has already spoken, and its words should be our guide.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A conflict that has left an indelible stain upon the fabric of our nation.  It was a war that began with a dubious premise, a rationale that seemed as tenuous as a spider's web in the wind.  The government, in its zeal to justify the invasion, crafted a narrative that linked the attacks of September 11th to the very existence of Saddam Hussein.  But the truth, like a ghost, lingered just beyond the reaches of their words, a specter that haunted the halls of power.\n\nAs one who has always been opposed to the notion of war, I watched with growing unease as our nation embarked upon this ill-fated endeavor.  The preemptive strike, a concept that smacked of hubris and arrogance, seemed to ignore the lessons of history.  The parallels between Iraq and Vietnam were stark, and yet, our government chose to ignore the cautionary tales of the past.\n\nThe human cost of this war has been staggering.  Thousands of American lives lost, thousands more maimed, and a nation left to pick up the pieces of a shattered society.  The removal of a government, the imposition of a new order, and the chaos that followed were all predictable outcomes, yet our leaders seemed to be woefully unprepared for the consequences.\n\nLike a patient who has been lulled into a false sense of security, the American people were promised a swift and decisive victory.  But the reality was far more complex, a labyrinth of insurgency and resistance that has left us mired in a quagmire.  The notion that we could impose our will upon a nation, that we could remake it in our image, was a hubris that has been our undoing.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was the question of motivation.  The rhetoric of democracy and freedom, a noble cause indeed, but one that rings hollow when seen through the prism of self-interest.  The pursuit of oil, the control of resources, a calculus that has guided our actions from the outset.  The absence of weapons of mass destruction, the contradictions in our policy, all these have served to erode the legitimacy of our cause.\n\nAs I reflect upon this conflict, I am left with a sense of unease, a sense that our decisions have been guided more by expediency than principle.  I can only hope that it will soon come to an end, that the people of Iraq will know peace, and that our nation will emerge with a modicum of dignity intact.  But for now, the war in Iraq remains a dark stain upon our collective conscience, a reminder of the perils of unchecked power and the dangers of a leadership that prioritizes expediency over principle.",
            "The notion of gay marriage, a proposition that has long been a point of contention, has always been one that resonates deeply within me. It is a matter, I firmly believe, of personal preference, a choice that is as inherent as the color of one's eyes or the cadence of their heartbeat. The notion that this fundamental aspect of an individual's being can be subject to the whims of societal dictate is, to me, a travesty. The science, I have come to understand, suggests that the inclination towards one's own kind may be rooted in biology, a predisposition that cannot be altered by the vicissitudes of upbringing or environment.\n\nIt is a personal matter, one that transcends the boundaries of politics and state. I see no role for governance in the sanctity of love, be it between two men, two women, or any other configuration. In my own neighborhood, I have witnessed families, forged by love and commitment, that defy the narrow definitions of traditional marriage. They walk their dogs, they tend to their gardens, and they live their lives with the same dignity and purpose as any other family.\n\nAnd yet, we have those who would seek to impose their own will upon others, to pervert the sacred bond of marriage into a tool of their own design. It is a conceit, a hubris, that betrays the very essence of what it means to be human. The president's attempt to parse the meaning of marriage, to impose his own interpretation upon a concept that has been shaped by the trials and tribulations of centuries, is a folly of monumental proportions.\n\nI have delved into the matter, read the reports, the studies, and the findings of those who have sought to understand the human heart. And what I have come to realize is that the inclination towards one's own kind may be as innate as the rhythm of the heart. The influence of environment, of upbringing, may play a role, but it is a minor one. The fundamental truth of our being, the essence of who we are, cannot be reduced to such simplistic explanations.\n\nAnd so, I find myself at odds with a system that would seek to stigmatize, to marginalize, those who would seek to love and commitment in their own way. Marriage, if it is to be a union at all, must be a private affair, a sacred bond between two individuals who have chosen to commit themselves to one another. It is not for the state to dictate, to control, or to judge. It is a matter of the heart, a matter of love, and it must be allowed to flourish, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation.",
            "The internet, a vast and unforgiving expanse, where the whispers of the past linger, waiting to be unearthed by the most inquisitive of ears. When we release a fragment of ourselves into this boundless void, we must be aware that it shall be seen by all. No secrets hide in the digital realm, no whispers are lost to the ether. The very notion of privacy is a myth, a fleeting illusion that dissolves in the harsh light of cyberspace.\n\nAs an RA, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this unyielding medium. The careless words, the hasty thoughts, the desperate pleas – all these and more can be conjured up, only to be forever etched in the annals of cyberspace. And when they are, the consequences are dire. Opinions are formed, judgments are passed, and the weight of the world's gaze settles upon us.\n\nIn the instance that transpired, a rumor, a fragment of a conversation, a whispered threat – whatever its origin, it was enough to set in motion a chain of events that would change the course of our lives. The school officials, bound by their duty to protect, were forced to act. They combed through the digital detritus, searching for answers, for clues that would lead them to the source. And when they found it, they were met with a revelation that would test their resolve.\n\nIn the world of the internet, there is no refuge from prying eyes. We cannot hide from the consequences of our actions, for they are laid bare for all to see. The bulletin, that anonymous whisper, was passed from hand to hand, a catalyst for a chain reaction that would forever alter the landscape. We are not immune to the scrutiny of the world; our actions, our words, our very thoughts – all are subject to the capricious winds of cyberspace.\n\nAnd so, we are left with the knowledge that our digital footprints will forever be a part of us, a testament to our frailty, our vulnerabilities, and our darkest fears. The school officials, in their duty to protect, must navigate this treacherous landscape, ever vigilant, ever watchful. But we, as individuals, must be aware of the power we wield, the power to shape our own destinies, to create our own reality. For in the world of the internet, the line between truth and fiction is blurred, and the consequences of our actions are forever etched in the digital stone.",
            "In the desolate twilight of our endeavors, the war has been protracted far beyond its righteous purpose. What began as a noble quest to resurrect democracy in a land beset by tyranny has devolved into a senseless exercise in futility. The initial impetus, though well-intentioned, was soon lost in the mire of circumstance and expediency. The whispered motives of the past, suspect even then, have been shrouded in the shadows of time.\n\nGeorge Bush's father, a man of gravitas and conviction, had long harbored a deep-seated animosity towards Saddam Hussein, a dictator of unyielding cruelty. Whether this familial vendetta was a factor in our decision to invade, it is a question that haunts us still. If our purpose was to bestow democracy upon a people subjugated by the whims of a tyrant, then we might have had justification for our actions. But to suggest that personal grievances played a part in our deliberations would be to compromise the very fabric of our moral authority.\n\nThe conflict, once a bold statement of intent, has dragged on for years, a seemingly endless cycle of bloodshed and despair. We began with a clear objective, to shatter the chains of oppression and liberate a people. Yet, our resolve has wavered, our purpose obscured by the fog of time. The war has become an end in itself, a means of asserting our dominance over the world stage. We are reluctant to surrender, to relinquish the illusion of victory, even as the cost in blood and treasure mounts.\n\nThe economy, once a thriving behemoth, now groans beneath the weight of our protracted involvement. Billions of dollars, siphoned from our own coffers, have been squandered on a conflict that has lost its moral compass. We have ignored the domestic scourges that plague our own lands: poverty, hunger, and disease. Our cities decay, our schools falter, and our healthcare system teeters on the brink of collapse. And for what? So that we might maintain a semblance of power, a fleeting illusion that we have not been defeated in this, our own private Vietnam.\n\nWe have lost sight of our purpose, and in doing so, we have lost ourselves. It is time to acknowledge the futility of our endeavors and withdraw, to allow the Iraqis to fend for themselves, to forge their own destiny. The war has been a drain on our economy, a wound that will not heal. It is time to tend to our own wounds, to direct our resources towards the problems that afflict us, to rediscover our own sense of purpose and direction.",
            "The notion that one might be spared the weight of a life lost, all due to a casual perusal of a profile on a vast and unforgiving expanse of cyberspace, raises a host of questions about the nature of privacy and the unseen hands that shape our lives. It is a notion that implies a world where the web is a watchdog, ever vigilant, ever ready to intervene in the course of human events. But the truth is far more complicated, a labyrinth of rights and responsibilities, of openness and concealment.\n\nIn the realm of Myspace, or any of its ilk, one's personal details are laid bare, a testament to the notion that what is shared with the world is, in fact, a gift to the world. The notion that one might befriend another and, in doing so, grant them unfettered access to one's innermost thoughts and desires, is a curious thing. And yet, it is a choice we all make, a Faustian bargain if you will, where we surrender a measure of our privacy in exchange for the fleeting thrill of connection.\n\nBut what of the stranger, the faceless figure who might stumble upon our profiles, uninvited and unseen? Do we not, in a sense, invite them in, by virtue of our very presence on the web? The notion that someone might be tasked with scouring the digital realm for potential threats is a slippery slope, a path that leads down into the quicksand of discrimination, where the potential for harm is ever-present.\n\nI myself do not have a Myspace, but I do inhabit theFacebook, a realm where the boundaries between public and private are constantly shifting. I am aware of the creeping sense of unease that comes with sharing one's life with the world, the knowledge that there are those out there who might seek to do us harm. The ease with which information can be gathered, the way in which a stranger might insinuate themselves into our lives, is a sobering thing.\n\nAnd yet, the very notion of limiting our online presence is a tricky one. We want to be connected, to share our thoughts and experiences with others, to be seen and heard. And so we strike a balance, a delicate dance between openness and concealment. But in the end, it is a balance that is ever-shifting, a constant negotiation with the unknown.\n\nI was struck by the notion of a high school that sought to ban its students from Myspace, a move that struck me as both arbitrary and oppressive. The notion that a school might dictate what its students can and cannot do online is a curious thing, a blurring of the lines between education and control. But it is a sentiment that speaks to the deeper unease that lies at the heart of our relationship with the web, a fear that we are losing ourselves in the void, that we are becoming anonymous and invisible.",
            "The specter of Iraq looms, a constant reminder of a war that has sullied our collective conscience. I find myself hesitant to broach the subject, a hypocrite among the chorus of dissent that has grown louder with each passing day. The weight of history bears down upon us, and I dare not join the throngs of voices that proclaim their opposition from the outset. Yet, I must confess that my own convictions have evolved, and I now align myself with the majority who deem the invasion a catastrophic mistake.\n\nThe numbers are stark: a resounding seventy-five to eighty percent of the global population, including the Iraqi people themselves, concur that the war was a grave error. Even among the troops stationed in the war-torn country, a significant majority share this view, advocating for an expedited withdrawal. The statistics are a testament to the futility of our endeavor, a quagmire from which we cannot extricate ourselves.\n\nThe culture clash between East and West is a chasm that has long been papered over by the hubris of our leaders. They have sought to impose their notion of democracy upon a people who may not desire it, who may not even comprehend it. Saddam Hussein's tyranny was abhorrent, to be sure, but was it truly our place to determine the fate of a nation, to wield the hammer of intervention with such reckless abandon?\n\nAs I ponder the complexity of this issue, I find myself at a loss for words. The administration touts its vision for a peaceful resolution, a gradual withdrawal, but I remain unconvinced. The prospect of leaving is fraught with peril, yet staying on an indefinite course seems equally calamitous. I have yet to hear a compelling argument for prolonging our occupation, a justification that would assuage my doubts.\n\nIn the end, it is the voices of the Iraqi people that resonate most profoundly. Eighty percent of them believe we should depart within a year; a quarter implore us to leave now. These are the individuals we claim to be rescuing, and their counsel carries a weight that we would do well to heed. By asking for their guidance, we might absolve ourselves of the responsibility that comes with imposing our will upon them. If the venture fails, we can point to their decision as a justification for our withdrawal.\n\nUltimately, our presence in Iraq has been a disaster, a misadventure born of hubris and ignorance. We will never be the benevolent saviors of the Middle East; our actions have already irreparably damaged the fabric of that region. Still, if we were to heed the call of the Iraqi people, if we were to depart with dignity and humility, we might yet salvage some semblance of honor from the ruins of this debacle.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of modern America, a lingering specter of gender discrimination lingers, a stubborn remnant of a bygone era. It is a malaise that infects not solely the realm of women, but also the particular industries and professions that have been calcified by the weight of societal expectation. The glass ceiling persists, a mirage of equality that tantalizes, yet remains elusive, a barrier that bars the advancement of individuals based on their sex rather than their merit.\n\nIn the workplace, women face an insidious form of oppression, their qualifications and abilities overlooked in favor of the conventional wisdom that has been ingrained in the collective psyche. The notion that women are unsuited for leadership positions, that they are not the \"natural\" choice to hold sway over the business world, still lingers, a spectral presence that haunts the corridors of power.\n\nBut this is not a phenomenon unique to women. Men, too, are vulnerable to the same biases and prejudices, their choices and aspirations dismissed as aberrant or unmanly. The stay-at-home father, that most countercultural of roles, is met with suspicion and disdain, his decision to prioritize family and domesticity viewed as a sign of weakness rather than strength. The fashion industry, with its labyrinthine hierarchies and arbitrary standards, is another domain where masculinity is policed and scrutinized, where men who defy the conventional mold are regarded with skepticism and even ridicule.\n\nChange, in this environment, is a slow and halting process. The pace of progress is incremental, measured in increments of acceptance and understanding. Women, increasingly, are breaking through the glass ceiling, assuming positions of power and influence that were once the exclusive preserve of men. The rise of the stay-at-home dad, too, is a phenomenon that is slowly gaining acceptance, as more men begin to question the traditional roles and expectations that have defined masculinity for so long.\n\nBut even as progress is made, there remains a deep-seated reluctance to challenge the status quo, a fear of the unknown that makes it difficult to effect meaningful change. The key, perhaps, lies not in forcing the issue, but in showcasing the qualities and strengths of those who have been marginalized and excluded. By highlighting the achievements and abilities of individuals who defy the conventional wisdom, we may slowly begin to erode the biases and prejudices that have been so deeply ingrained in our society.\n\nAnd yet, even as we make progress, we must acknowledge that there are other forms of discrimination at play, other forms of oppression that are just as insidious and pernicious. Class, geography, and education all play a role in determining who has access to opportunity and who is excluded. The man from the farm, with his rough-hewn speech and unpolished demeanor, may be viewed with suspicion by those who have been schooled in the corridors of power, who view his lack of refinement as a sign of ignorance rather than a badge of honor.\n\nIn this complex and multifaceted landscape, the struggle for equality and justice is an ongoing one, a battle that will not be won easily or quickly. But it is a battle that must be fought, nonetheless, for the sake of our collective humanity, and for the sake of a society that values merit and achievement over arbitrary and outdated notions of what it means to be a man or a woman.",
            "The matter of legalization.  Or rather, decriminalization.  A distinction without a difference for some, yet a chasm of consequence for others.  In this place, the law has shifted, the weight of justice lifted from the shoulders of those who would possess certain substances.  No longer a crime to be shrouded in secrecy, but a transgression to be reckoned with, a mere citation, a minor infraction.\n\nThe question of ramifications lingers, a specter of doubt that haunts those who would seek to indulge.  The specter of job interviews, of futures uncertain, of reputations tarnished.  Yet, there are those who argue that the cost of arrest, of trial, of incarceration, is a weight too great to bear.  The municipalities, strapped for resources, struggling to find solace in a world of dwindling coffers.  In such places, the allure of decriminalization is a siren's call, a promise of freedom from the burdens of a bygone era.\n\nIn places like Denver, where the winds of change blow strong, the people seem more willing to take the leap.  To throw off the shackles of prohibition, to unlock the gates of commerce and freedom.  The promise of revenue, a windfall of sorts, a chance to fund programs long neglected, to nourish the bodies and minds of those in need.\n\nBut there are those who caution against such a course.  Who see the dangers of a substance, of its effects on the body and the mind.  The risk of impairment, of dependency, of a society lost to the haze of indulgence.  And so the debate rages on, a battle of wits, of wills, of conviction.\n\nFor in the end, it is not a question of right or wrong, but of degree.  Of the fine line between moderation and excess.  Of the individuals, each with their own unique response, their own path to tread.  And so we are left with a truth, a truth that is as stark as it is simple: that substances, like people, are complex, multifaceted, and forever shrouded in mystery.",
            "The weight of tradition hangs heavy in the air, a palpable force that binds and constrains. The rituals, the dogma, the unyielding adherence to the ways of old. It is a comfort to cling to what is familiar, to be rooted in the earthy richness of the past. Yet, in this unyielding grasp, lies a danger - the refusal to bend, to yield, to adapt to the shifting currents of time.\n\nThe Catholic Church, a bastion of tradition, stands firm against the tides of change. Its strictures, its catechisms, its unyielding code of conduct. And yet, in this rigidity, lies a hypocrisy. For how can one preach love and acceptance, and yet deny the very essence of those precepts? The story of my parents' marriage, a tale of exclusion and rejection, speaks volumes of this contradiction.\n\nMy mother, a devout Catholic, my father, an Episcopalian - their love, denied by the very institution that claims to teach compassion and understanding. The doctrine of love, a hollow shell, ringing hollow in the ears of those who fail to conform. The practice of the Church, a far cry from the ideals it espouses. Outdated, yet stubbornly clinging to the past, like a shipwreck on the rocks of progress.\n\nThe question of priests and marriage, a mere trifle, a trifling matter, when set against the backdrop of the atrocity that plagues the Church. The confluence of power and pedophilia, a toxic stew, brewed in the depths of institutional rot. And yet, the notion that allowing priests to marry would somehow mitigate this evil, is a naive conceit. The lust for power, the corruption of the human heart, these are not things that can be legislated away, nor can they be cured by the sacrament of marriage.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the absence of marriage that breeds monsters, but the presence of a power that is unaccountable, that is unanswerable to the frailties of humanity. And so, the Church, in its rigidity, in its refusal to bend, stands as a monument to its own failure, a testament to the destructive power of unyielding dogma.",
            "In the twilight of reason, the issue hangs precariously, a delicate balance between the sacrosanct boundaries of church and state. The notion of marriage, a bond forged in the crucible of love and devotion, threatens to splinter asunder beneath the weight of definition. The chasm between right and wrong, once a clear and well-trod path, has grown shrouded in a miasma of uncertainty.\n\nIt is a topic that taxes the mind, a Gordian knot of contradictions, where the sacred and the profane entwine like the tendrils of a vine. To define marriage, to reduce it to a set of prosaic, government-sanctioned terms, is to risk offending those who hold it dear as a sacrament. And yet, to acknowledge its sacrosanct nature is to invite the specter of favoritism, of one denomination or sect being elevated above another.\n\nIn this vacuum of certitude, I find myself adrift, unable to anchor my thoughts to a single, firm conviction. But this much is clear: that the distinction between marriage and civil union is a distinction without a difference. Two people, committed to one another, bound by love and mutual devotion – what is this, if not a union worthy of recognition and respect?\n\nAnd so, I propose that we eschew the label of \"marriage,\" with all its attendant connotations and entanglements, and opt for a more neutral, more inclusive term: civil union. For in the end, it is not the words that matter, but the bond they represent – a bond that transcends the petty squabbles of doctrine and dogma.\n\nAs for the issue of gay marriage, I say this: let us not conflate it with the constitutionally sacrosanct institution of marriage. Let us not reduce it to a matter of amendment, a constitutional coup d'etat that would enshrine prejudice into the very fabric of our laws. The constitution is not a receptacle for the whims of the mob, but a document of enduring principle, a beacon of liberty and justice.\n\nIn the end, it is not the constitution that must be amended, but our own understanding of what it means to be human. Let us not seek to legislate love, but to recognize it, in all its forms, as a fundamental aspect of our shared humanity.",
            "The shadows of my upbringing as a Christian linger, a specter of doubt that haunts me still. For in the grey expanse between faith and reason, I find myself questioning the tenets of my upbringing. I have walked among those who have known love in its most forbidden forms, and I have seen the depth of their humanity. And yet, I still find myself at odds with the choices they have made.\n\nBut it is not my place to judge. The law, that great and unwieldy beast, should not be imposed upon the land by the hand of a single man. No, the decision to recognize the bonds of love between same-sex couples should be left to the discretion of each individual state, to be determined by the people who will live with its consequences.\n\nI have watched as the pendulum of power has swung, and the tides of public opinion have ebbed and flowed. But in the end, it is not the president who will bear the weight of this decision. It is the people, the common folk who toil in the fields and tend the hearths, who will be forced to live with the fruits of this legislation.\n\nAnd so I believe that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the states, to be determined by the will of the people. For it is they who will be most affected by this decision, and it is they who should have a say in how it is governed. The president, that great and distant figure, should not presume to speak for the people, to impose his will upon them as if he were some sort of monarch. No, the people should be free to make their own decisions, to govern themselves as they see fit.\n\nIn the end, it is not about the law, but about the human heart. And it is in the hearts of the people that this decision should be made, not in the halls of power.",
            "The notion that Myspace is a private domain is a notion best left to the uninitiated.  In reality, it is a public stage upon which one's every thought and action is laid bare for all to see.  The notion that a student posting on Myspace might be unaware of this is a notion that defies common sense.  When one posts on the internet, one forfeits the right to privacy, for the internet is a realm where the past and present coexist in an eternal dance of transparency.\n\nThe school officials, in their efforts to protect their students, are merely exercising a duty that is incumbent upon them.  They have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of those in their care, and if that means monitoring the online activities of their students, then so be it.  The notion that this is an invasion of privacy is a notion that is both misguided and shortsighted.  For in a world where the horrors of Columbine and other such atrocities lurk in the shadows, one's personal safety cannot be taken for granted.\n\nThe school officials, in their efforts to prevent such tragedies, were merely doing what was necessary to protect their students.  They were not engaging in some grand conspiracy, but rather fulfilling their duty to provide a safe and secure environment for learning.  And if that means monitoring the online activities of their students, then so be it.\n\nIt is a quaint notion that one's online activities are somehow separate from their real lives.  But the truth is, they are not separate.  The internet is a mirror that reflects our every move, and those who would seek to hide their true nature do so at their own peril.  The school officials, in their efforts to ensure the safety of their students, were merely acknowledging this reality.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of perspective.  Is the school official's decision to monitor the online activities of their students an invasion of privacy, or is it a necessary measure to ensure their safety?  The answer, much like the internet itself, is a reflection of our own moral compass.",
            "It began with the echo of fire, the scent of ash and smoke, a wound that would not heal. The flames of September's horror still danced in the hearts of the people, and I stood among them, a vessel of fury and vengeance. At first, I was consumed by the desire to unleash our wrath upon those who had perpetrated such evil. I envisioned a maelstrom of destruction, a reckoning that would rival the devastation they had wrought upon our own soil.\n\nBut as the embers of that passion cooled, I began to see the world in a different light. The tumultuous landscape of the Middle East, a tapestry of ancient hatreds and tribal vendettas, seemed to mock our simplistic notions of good and evil. We had descended upon their shores, a force both pitiless and unprepared, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own sorrow.\n\nIn the aftermath, I came to realize that our involvement was a tragic miscalculation, a flight from the darkness of our own past rather than a bold step into the light. We had avenged our losses, but in doing so, we had sown the seeds of further chaos. The people of that land, a complex web of contradictions, were not so easily swayed by our benevolence or our military might. They were a people of a different creed, one that prized honor and loyalty above all else.\n\nAs I looked upon the ruins of our endeavor, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disillusionment. We had entered their world with a messianic fervor, convinced that we could remake their society in our own image. But they were not a people to be saved or redeemed; they were a people to be understood, with all their flaws and imperfections.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy we sought to vanquish, but our own hubris. We had come to believe that we were the saviors of the world, that our presence was a blessing, and that our withdrawal a curse. But the truth was far more mundane: we were a people lost in a labyrinth of our own making, driven by passions that we could not control.\n\nAs I stood on the precipice of this realization, I knew that our involvement was a mistake, a grave error that would haunt us for generations to come. We had tried to impose our will upon a people who would not be swayed, and in doing so, we had merely hastened their downfall. It was a lesson that would be etched in my mind forever: that in the end, it is not the enemy we must fear, but our own fallibility."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

Its unyielding stance on matters of the heart and soul has become a burden, a fetid weight that chokes the life from the very air it breathes. The world moves forward, propelled by the tides of time, while the Church remains mired in the muck of dogma and dogmatic conviction. The cries of its adherents, once a chorus of devotion, now rise in discordant dissent as they chafe against the constraints of a bygone era.\n\nThe issue of abortion, a beacon of contention, serves as a litmus test for the Church's rigid stance on matters of the flesh. Those who would seek to exercise their agency over their own bodies are met with an unyielding orthodoxy, a doctrine that brooks no dissent. The same holds true for the sacrament of marriage, redefined by the Church as a union between one man and one woman, rather than the sacrosanct bond between two individuals who love and cherish one another. The tectonic plates of societal norms are shifting, leaving the Church's rigid stance on these issues to appear increasingly anachronistic.\n\nThe exclusion of women from the priesthood is another matter of contention, a barrier that reinforces the notion that the Church is out of touch with the world it seeks to serve. The notion that a life of devotion to God must preclude a life of devotion to another human being seems a specious notion, one that prioritizes the abstractions of faith over the messiness of human experience. And yet, the Church remains resolute in its stance, unmoved by the entreaties of those who would seek to bring it into the 21st century.\n\nIt is a paradox that the Church, which claims to be a vessel for the divine, should be so bound to the strictures of tradition. Is it not possible that a more flexible, more adaptive approach might serve the faithful better, allowing the Church to speak to the hopes and fears of a changing world? The world will not wait for the Church to catch up; it will move forward, leaving the institution to ponder its relevance in a world that has moved on without it.\n\nIn the end, it is not the Church's views that are at issue, but its refusal to adapt to the world as it is. The faithful will continue to grapple with the contradictions of their faith, even as they are driven from the fold by the Church's unyielding stance. The question remains: will the Church find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the demands of a rapidly changing world, or will it become an anachronism, a relic of a bygone era?",
            "In the vast expanse of human existence, there exists a dichotomy that has long plagued our collective conscience: the notion of choice versus inherent nature. The question of whether one's sexual orientation is a deliberate selection or an immutable aspect of their being is a complex and contentious issue. I shall not pretend to be an expert in this arena, but I do harbor a deep conviction that the innate inclinations of another should not be subject to societal judgment or censure.\n\nThe idea that an individual's sexual orientation is a choice, a decision made with full awareness and deliberation, strikes me as a notion born of ignorance and bias. To posit that a person is somehow responsible for their very essence, their fundamental being, is to ignore the very fabric of human experience. We are not born with a predetermined set of choices, but rather, we are born into a world where our inclinations are shaped by a multitude of factors, including, but not limited to, our biology and our environment.\n\nThe notion that the federal government should dictate the parameters of love and relationships, that it should render judgment on the nature of another's heart, is a notion that reeks of paternalism and arrogance. It is a notion that disregards the inherent dignity of the individual, and the simple fact that each person's path is unique and sacred.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of human experience, there exists no thread more delicate, more precious, than the threads of love and identity. To interfere with these threads, to attempt to weave them into a predetermined pattern, is to tamper with the very fabric of existence. It is a grave injustice, a profound affront to the human spirit.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the issue of gay marriage is but a small, yet telling, indicator of our collective values. Do we value the inherent worth of each individual, or do we seek to impose our will upon them? Do we recognize the inherent dignity of love, in all its forms, or do we seek to constrain it to our narrow, bigoted definitions?\n\nThe answer, I believe, is clear. The federal government should not meddle in the affairs of the heart, for it is in the heart that we find our greatest freedom, our deepest truth. It is in the heart that we find our humanity, and it is in the heart that we must allow each other to live, to love, to be.",
            "In the grand tapestry of human existence, the thread of love weaves itself into countless patterns, defying the simplistic boundaries of heteronormativity. The notion that gay marriage should be legalized is not a radical proposition, but a logical extension of the fundamental human desire for unity and connection. The argument against it, however, is rooted in a tangle of misconceptions and outdated notions.\n\nTo suggest that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family unit is a notion as threadbare as a worn-out tapestry. The complexities of love and relationships cannot be reduced to such a simplistic dichotomy. It is as if one were to propose that the morning sun and the evening twilight are mutually exclusive, when in truth they are merely two distinct phases of the same celestial dance.\n\nThe civil rights at stake here are not trivialities, but essential aspects of human dignity. The inability of a partner to visit a bedridden loved one, solely because their relationship is not recognized by the state, is a morally reprehensible distinction. It is a cruel irony that those who are most deserving of compassion and support are often the ones denied the basic rights afforded to others.\n\nScience has spoken, and the evidence is clear: homosexual couples, like their heterosexual counterparts, are capable of forming loving and enduring relationships. The factors contributing to relationship satisfaction are not unique to one orientation or the other, but rather a universal human experience. The notion that one type of love is inherently superior to another is a notion as baseless as it is hurtful.\n\nWhen we strip away the rhetoric and the religiosity, the issue at its core is one of equality. If we permit the government to recognize the validity of civil unions, why do we deny the same recognition to marriage? Is it not a double standard to allow one and not the other? The parallels to segregation and the \"separate but equal\" doctrine are striking, and a disturbing reminder of the darker aspects of American history.\n\nThose who argue that gay marriage will somehow corrupt the fabric of society, or that children raised by gay parents will be irreparably damaged, are relying on outdated science and unfounded fears. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against these claims, and yet they persist. It is a chilling reminder of the dangers of unchecked prejudice and the importance of reason in the face of dogma.\n\nIn the end, it is not the job of the government to impose its will on the moral compass of its citizens. Rather, it is the duty of the government to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their orientation. The amendment banning gay marriage is a thinly veiled attempt to impose a particular moral agenda on the nation, one that is as misguided as it is unjust.\n\nAs we navigate the complexities of human nature, it is essential that we listen to the voices of reason and compassion, rather than the whispers of fear and intolerance. The world would be a brighter place if we could see beyond our differences and recognize the common humanity that unites us all.",
            "The hushed tones of a summer afternoon in the hospital pharmacy, where the sterile air clings to the skin like a damp shroud. It is here, amidst the sterile beakers and the quiet whispers of patients in need, that I find myself drawn into the fray of a debate that refuses to be extinguished. The whispered counsel of a cautious mind, it is said that a drug's illicit status does not preclude its potential for healing. This, I firmly believe, is a truth that warrants consideration.\n\nThe shadows cast by the law's stern gaze do not eradicate the benefits of a substance, merely obscure them. Consider, if you will, the controlled substances that lie within our reach: oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets. These, too, were once deemed illicit, yet their utility cannot be denied. Their presence in our arsenal is a testament to the human spirit's capacity for adaptation, a testament to the notion that even the most feared of substances can be harnessed for the greater good.\n\nThe parallels drawn between marijuana and alcohol are facile, but misguided. The former, if abused, can indeed sow discord, but so too can the latter. The distinction lies not in the substance itself, but in the human heart that wields it. To integrate marijuana into our lexicon of remedies, to gradually welcome it into the fold, would be a prudent step, one that acknowledges its potential for healing while also tempering its potential for abuse.\n\nThe pall of prohibition has cast a long shadow over marijuana, one that has sullied its reputation and led many to view it as a pariah. But this is a misconception, a misconception born of fear and ignorance. To dispel this notion, to reveal the gentle face of marijuana, would be to liberate it from the shackles of taboo. And it is here, in this liberation, that we might find a glimmer of hope – a hope that, in time, people may come to understand its value, to wield it responsibly, and to harness its potential for the greater good.",
            "The church, a bastion of tradition, has indeed yielded to the creeping tides of modernity. No longer do its doors stand as a bastion of austerity, but rather a threshold to a realm of flexibility. The once-imposing strictures of Sunday observance have given way to a more relaxed atmosphere, a concession to the capricious whims of a changing world. The children, once attired in their Sunday finery, now mingle with the adults in a haze of casual attire, their beach-worn garb a testament to the dwindling distinction between sacred and profane.\n\nIn the morning masses, where once the devotees donned their Sunday best, now the faithful appear in jeans and khakis, a testament to the prevailing zeitgeist of informality. The church, once a citadel of reverence, has become a more diffuse, less formal institution. And yet, amidst this sea of change, a question lingers: might the church's stance on the ordination of women and the marriage of its clergy have mitigated the scourge of pedophilia that has tainted its reputation?\n\nIt is a notion that strikes at the very heart of the matter. Could the rules and regulations that govern the church's hierarchy have been a catalyst for the very evil it sought to prevent? I say no. The predilections of the human heart are not so easily swayed by dogma or decree. A man's nature, like a deep well, runs true to form. The institution, in its efforts to address this issue, would do well to consider the words of Ecclesiastes: \"In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand.\"\n\nPedophilia, a pernicious force, cannot be legislated away by the mere fiat of human edict. It is a darkness that lurks within, a shadow that haunts the recesses of the human heart. A man's inclinations, his desires, are not so easily redirected by the trappings of marriage or the benedictions of the church. They are an intractable part of his being, a stubborn thread in the tapestry of his nature.\n\nAnd so, as we ponder the failings of the church, we must not forget the inherent frailties of human nature. The church's attempts to address this issue, though well-intentioned, are ultimately doomed to fail. For it is not a problem that can be solved by decree or regulation, but rather by the slow and painful process of self-discovery and confession.",
            "A weariness settles over me like a shroud, a fatigue born of a truth slowly revealed. In the aftermath of the September 11th atrocities, a nation reeled, its collective psyche left scarred. And yet, in the darkness of that anguish, a pretext emerged, a justification for the invasion of Iraq. The Bush administration wove a tapestry of deceit, linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden, and the nonexistent cache of weapons of mass destruction a thread that frayed with each passing day.\n\nThe mendacity of the administration's claims still rankles, a festering wound that refuses to heal. The specter of Colin Powell's UN address, a masterful performance of conviction without conviction, now a stark reminder of the administration's propensity for lies. Malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense, a betrayal of the trust placed in those who govern. The Constitution, once a beacon of hope, now lies in tatters, its principles trampled underfoot by a regime oblivious to its own hubris.\n\nThe younger Bush, driven by a bloodlust born of paternal vendetta, had harbored a deep-seated desire for war, a desire that would not be satiated until the sands of Iraq ran red with the blood of its people. Energy interests, a utilitarian calculus, had played a clandestine role in the decision to invade, a quiet coup that would reshape the Middle East to serve the interests of the powerful few.\n\nThe war, a pyre of chaos and destruction, has raged on for far too long. A withdrawal now would only serve to fan the flames of civil war, a maelstrom of violence that would consume the very fabric of Iraqi society. The proposed coalition of nations, a feeble attempt to restore order, only serves to highlight the grave doubts that plague this endeavor. The sovereignty of Iraq, a concept as elusive as the wind, would be reduced to a distant memory, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe Iraqi Parliament, a dysfunctional assembly, struggles to assert its authority, its ineffectiveness a testament to the fractious nature of the country's politics. The figure of the Prime Minister, a shadow of a leader, powerless to stem the tide of chaos. The radical elements, a constant threat to stability, vie for control, their presence a reminder of the anarchy that lies at the heart of this conflict.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, my mind a maelstrom of doubt and confusion. The truth, a will-o'-the-wisp, eludes me, leaving me with only the faintest glimmer of understanding in this desolate landscape of war and deception.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A conflict without form or purpose, a maelstrom of chaos and bloodshed that has consumed us all.  I find myself lost in the labyrinth of my thoughts, searching for a thread to cling to, a glimmer of sense in the darkness.  And yet, the more I ponder, the more I am consumed by the void.\n\nIt began, I suppose, as a response to the wounds of nine eleven.  A desire for revenge, a hunger for justice that consumed us all.  But now, as the years stretch out before us like a barren wasteland, I am left to wonder if it was all for naught.  A war without a clear purpose, a conflict without a victor.  We speak of democracy and freedom, but what do we truly mean by these words?  Is it not merely a euphemism for our own self-interest, our own desire to impose our will upon a people who do not desire our help?\n\nI am not one to keep pace with the intricacies of war, the twists and turns of politics and strategy.  But I do know that the longer we linger in this desert, the more we risk succumbing to the very same pitfalls that have consumed the Iraqis themselves.  We speak of building a new nation, but what of the old one?  Is it not being dismantled, piece by piece, as we seek to remake it in our own image?  And for what?  So that we may extract their oil, their resources?  Or so that we may claim another victory, another notch in our belt?\n\nThe ghosts of Vietnam haunt us still, a cautionary tale of the dangers of meddling in the affairs of others.  We speak of the importance of staying the course, but what course is this?  Is it a path of destruction and chaos, or one of peace and understanding?  I am torn, lost in the maelstrom of conflicting emotions and half-truths.\n\nAnd yet, I am drawn back to the faces of those who have fought and died in this conflict.  The families who have lost loved ones, the sons and daughters who have been torn from their homes and their lives.  I am reminded that there are two sides to this conflict, two perspectives that cannot be reduced to simple slogans or soundbites.  And so I am left with more questions than answers, more doubts than certainties.\n\nThe war in Iraq will continue, it seems, a never-ending cycle of violence and bloodshed.  And we will be there, caught in the midst of it all, our actions and decisions shaped by a complex web of motivations and desires.  But what of our own humanity?  Will we emerge from this conflict with our souls intact, or will we be forever changed by the horrors we have unleashed?  Only time will tell, but for now, I am left to ponder the void, searching for a glimmer of sense in the darkness.",
            "The notion of government decreeing the validity of certain creeds is a notion that rankles.  It is an affront to the very fabric of our constitution, a document forged in the fire of reason and freedom.  The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of our republic, is a bulwark against the tyranny of dogma and the whims of the powerful.  \n\nTo attempt to codify the legitimacy of faith into law is to invite the darkness of sectarianism, to cleave the people asunder by the axe of intolerance.  The constitution, a sacred text that has guided our nation from its inception, explicitly safeguards against this very thing.  Its words, etched into the stone of history, bear witness to the wisdom of those who came before us.\n\nThe idea that a single church's edict should be the benchmark for the actions of the state is a notion that reeks of bigotry and oppression.  History is replete with examples of those who have been consumed by the very fire of zealotry they sought to impose upon others.  The Catholic Church, a bastion of tradition and doctrine, is not above reproach in this regard.  Its opposition to this issue is a testament to the variance of faith, and the human propensity for divisiveness.\n\nThe president's push for an amendment, driven by his personal conviction as a Catholic, is a brazen display of preference.  It is a flagrant disregard for the principles of our founding, and a slap in the face to the very idea of religious tolerance that has made our nation great.  There is no economic or social imperative that warrants such a draconian measure.  In fact, the opposite is likely true: a free and open society, unshackled by the constraints of dogma, is far more likely to flourish.\n\nThe notion that the government should dictate the parameters of faith is a notion that should be rejected outright.  It is a slippery slope that leads to the very thing we seek to avoid: the oppression of the many by the few.  We must stand strong against this tide of intolerance, and uphold the principles that have guided us thus far.  The people, not the government, should decide what is right and what is wrong.  The constitution has already spoken, and its words should be our guide.",
            "The war in Iraq.  A conflict that has left an indelible stain upon the fabric of our nation.  It was a war that began with a dubious premise, a rationale that seemed as tenuous as a spider's web in the wind.  The government, in its zeal to justify the invasion, crafted a narrative that linked the attacks of September 11th to the very existence of Saddam Hussein.  But the truth, like a ghost, lingered just beyond the reaches of their words, a specter that haunted the halls of power.\n\nAs one who has always been opposed to the notion of war, I watched with growing unease as our nation embarked upon this ill-fated endeavor.  The preemptive strike, a concept that smacked of hubris and arrogance, seemed to ignore the lessons of history.  The parallels between Iraq and Vietnam were stark, and yet, our government chose to ignore the cautionary tales of the past.\n\nThe human cost of this war has been staggering.  Thousands of American lives lost, thousands more maimed, and a nation left to pick up the pieces of a shattered society.  The removal of a government, the imposition of a new order, and the chaos that followed were all predictable outcomes, yet our leaders seemed to be woefully unprepared for the consequences.\n\nLike a patient who has been lulled into a false sense of security, the American people were promised a swift and decisive victory.  But the reality was far more complex, a labyrinth of insurgency and resistance that has left us mired in a quagmire.  The notion that we could impose our will upon a nation, that we could remake it in our image, was a hubris that has been our undoing.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was the question of motivation.  The rhetoric of democracy and freedom, a noble cause indeed, but one that rings hollow when seen through the prism of self-interest.  The pursuit of oil, the control of resources, a calculus that has guided our actions from the outset.  The absence of weapons of mass destruction, the contradictions in our policy, all these have served to erode the legitimacy of our cause.\n\nAs I reflect upon this conflict, I am left with a sense of unease, a sense that our decisions have been guided more by expediency than principle.  I can only hope that it will soon come to an end, that the people of Iraq will know peace, and that our nation will emerge with a modicum of dignity intact.  But for now, the war in Iraq remains a dark stain upon our collective conscience, a reminder of the perils of unchecked power and the dangers of a leadership that prioritizes expediency over principle.",
            "The notion of gay marriage, a proposition that has long been a point of contention, has always been one that resonates deeply within me. It is a matter, I firmly believe, of personal preference, a choice that is as inherent as the color of one's eyes or the cadence of their heartbeat. The notion that this fundamental aspect of an individual's being can be subject to the whims of societal dictate is, to me, a travesty. The science, I have come to understand, suggests that the inclination towards one's own kind may be rooted in biology, a predisposition that cannot be altered by the vicissitudes of upbringing or environment.\n\nIt is a personal matter, one that transcends the boundaries of politics and state. I see no role for governance in the sanctity of love, be it between two men, two women, or any other configuration. In my own neighborhood, I have witnessed families, forged by love and commitment, that defy the narrow definitions of traditional marriage. They walk their dogs, they tend to their gardens, and they live their lives with the same dignity and purpose as any other family.\n\nAnd yet, we have those who would seek to impose their own will upon others, to pervert the sacred bond of marriage into a tool of their own design. It is a conceit, a hubris, that betrays the very essence of what it means to be human. The president's attempt to parse the meaning of marriage, to impose his own interpretation upon a concept that has been shaped by the trials and tribulations of centuries, is a folly of monumental proportions.\n\nI have delved into the matter, read the reports, the studies, and the findings of those who have sought to understand the human heart. And what I have come to realize is that the inclination towards one's own kind may be as innate as the rhythm of the heart. The influence of environment, of upbringing, may play a role, but it is a minor one. The fundamental truth of our being, the essence of who we are, cannot be reduced to such simplistic explanations.\n\nAnd so, I find myself at odds with a system that would seek to stigmatize, to marginalize, those who would seek to love and commitment in their own way. Marriage, if it is to be a union at all, must be a private affair, a sacred bond between two individuals who have chosen to commit themselves to one another. It is not for the state to dictate, to control, or to judge. It is a matter of the heart, a matter of love, and it must be allowed to flourish, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation.",

When we release a fragment of ourselves into this boundless void, we must be aware that it shall be seen by all. No secrets hide in the digital realm, no whispers are lost to the ether. The very notion of privacy is a myth, a fleeting illusion that dissolves in the harsh light of cyberspace.\n\nAs an RA, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this unyielding medium. The careless words, the hasty thoughts, the desperate pleas – all these and more can be conjured up, only to be forever etched in the annals of cyberspace. And when they are, the consequences are dire. Opinions are formed, judgments are passed, and the weight of the world's gaze settles upon us.\n\nIn the instance that transpired, a rumor, a fragment of a conversation, a whispered threat – whatever its origin, it was enough to set in motion a chain of events that would change the course of our lives. The school officials, bound by their duty to protect, were forced to act. They combed through the digital detritus, searching for answers, for clues that would lead them to the source. And when they found it, they were met with a revelation that would test their resolve.\n\nIn the world of the internet, there is no refuge from prying eyes. We cannot hide from the consequences of our actions, for they are laid bare for all to see. The bulletin, that anonymous whisper, was passed from hand to hand, a catalyst for a chain reaction that would forever alter the landscape.

            "In the desolate twilight of our endeavors, the war has been protracted far beyond its righteous purpose. What began as a noble quest to resurrect democracy in a land beset by tyranny has devolved into a senseless exercise in futility. The initial impetus, though well-intentioned, was soon lost in the mire of circumstance and expediency. The whispered motives of the past, suspect even then, have been shrouded in the shadows of time.\n\nGeorge Bush's father, a man of gravitas and conviction, had long harbored a deep-seated animosity towards Saddam Hussein, a dictator of unyielding cruelty. Whether this familial vendetta was a factor in our decision to invade, it is a question that haunts us still. If our purpose was to bestow democracy upon a people subjugated by the whims of a tyrant, then we might have had justification for our actions. But to suggest that personal grievances played a part in our deliberations would be to compromise the very fabric of our moral authority.\n\nThe conflict, once a bold statement of intent, has dragged on for years, a seemingly endless cycle of bloodshed and despair. We began with a clear objective, to shatter the chains of oppression and liberate a people. Yet, our resolve has wavered, our purpose obscured by the fog of time. The war has become an end in itself, a means of asserting our dominance over the world stage. We are reluctant to surrender, to relinquish the illusion of victory, even as the cost in blood and treasure mounts.\n\nThe economy, once a thriving behemoth, now groans beneath the weight of our protracted involvement. Billions of dollars, siphoned from our own coffers, have been squandered on a conflict that has lost its moral compass. We have ignored the domestic scourges that plague our own lands: poverty, hunger, and disease. Our cities decay, our schools falter, and our healthcare system teeters on the brink of collapse. And for what? So that we might maintain a semblance of power, a fleeting illusion that we have not been defeated in this, our own private Vietnam.\n\nWe have lost sight of our purpose, and in doing so, we have lost ourselves. It is time to acknowledge the futility of our endeavors and withdraw, to allow the Iraqis to fend for themselves, to forge their own destiny. The war has been a drain on our economy, a wound that will not heal. It is time to tend to our own wounds, to direct our resources towards the problems that afflict us, to rediscover our own sense of purpose and direction.",
            "The notion that one might be spared the weight of a life lost, all due to a casual perusal of a profile on a vast and unforgiving expanse of cyberspace, raises a host of questions about the nature of privacy and the unseen hands that shape our lives. It is a notion that implies a world where the web is a watchdog, ever vigilant, ever ready to intervene in the course of human events. But the truth is far more complicated, a labyrinth of rights and responsibilities, of openness and concealment.\n\nIn the realm of Myspace, or any of its ilk, one's personal details are laid bare, a testament to the notion that what is shared with the world is, in fact, a gift to the world. The notion that one might befriend another and, in doing so, grant them unfettered access to one's innermost thoughts and desires, is a curious thing. And yet, it is a choice we all make, a Faustian bargain if you will, where we surrender a measure of our privacy in exchange for the fleeting thrill of connection.\n\nBut what of the stranger, the faceless figure who might stumble upon our profiles, uninvited and unseen? Do we not, in a sense, invite them in, by virtue of our very presence on the web? The notion that someone might be tasked with scouring the digital realm for potential threats is a slippery slope, a path that leads down into the quicksand of discrimination, where the potential for harm is ever-present.\n\nI myself do not have a Myspace, but I do inhabit theFacebook, a realm where the boundaries between public and private are constantly shifting. I am aware of the creeping sense of unease that comes with sharing one's life with the world, the knowledge that there are those out there who might seek to do us harm. The ease with which information can be gathered, the way in which a stranger might insinuate themselves into our lives, is a sobering thing.\n\nAnd yet, the very notion of limiting our online presence is a tricky one. We want to be connected, to share our thoughts and experiences with others, to be seen and heard. And so we strike a balance, a delicate dance between openness and concealment. But in the end, it is a balance that is ever-shifting, a constant negotiation with the unknown.\n\nI was struck by the notion of a high school that sought to ban its students from Myspace, a move that struck me as both arbitrary and oppressive. The notion that a school might dictate what its students can and cannot do online is a curious thing, a blurring of the lines between education and control. But it is a sentiment that speaks to the deeper unease that lies at the heart of our relationship with the web, a fear that we are losing ourselves in the void, that we are becoming anonymous and invisible.",
            "The specter of Iraq looms, a constant reminder of a war that has sullied our collective conscience. I find myself hesitant to broach the subject, a hypocrite among the chorus of dissent that has grown louder with each passing day. The weight of history bears down upon us, and I dare not join the throngs of voices that proclaim their opposition from the outset. Yet, I must confess that my own convictions have evolved, and I now align myself with the majority who deem the invasion a catastrophic mistake.\n\nThe numbers are stark: a resounding seventy-five to eighty percent of the global population, including the Iraqi people themselves, concur that the war was a grave error. Even among the troops stationed in the war-torn country, a significant majority share this view, advocating for an expedited withdrawal. The statistics are a testament to the futility of our endeavor, a quagmire from which we cannot extricate ourselves.\n\nThe culture clash between East and West is a chasm that has long been papered over by the hubris of our leaders. They have sought to impose their notion of democracy upon a people who may not desire it, who may not even comprehend it. Saddam Hussein's tyranny was abhorrent, to be sure, but was it truly our place to determine the fate of a nation, to wield the hammer of intervention with such reckless abandon?\n\nAs I ponder the complexity of this issue, I find myself at a loss for words. The administration touts its vision for a peaceful resolution, a gradual withdrawal, but I remain unconvinced. The prospect of leaving is fraught with peril, yet staying on an indefinite course seems equally calamitous. I have yet to hear a compelling argument for prolonging our occupation, a justification that would assuage my doubts.\n\nIn the end, it is the voices of the Iraqi people that resonate most profoundly. Eighty percent of them believe we should depart within a year; a quarter implore us to leave now. These are the individuals we claim to be rescuing, and their counsel carries a weight that we would do well to heed. By asking for their guidance, we might absolve ourselves of the responsibility that comes with imposing our will upon them. If the venture fails, we can point to their decision as a justification for our withdrawal.\n\nUltimately, our presence in Iraq has been a disaster, a misadventure born of hubris and ignorance. We will never be the benevolent saviors of the Middle East; our actions have already irreparably damaged the fabric of that region. Still, if we were to heed the call of the Iraqi people, if we were to depart with dignity and humility, we might yet salvage some semblance of honor from the ruins of this debacle.",
            "In the unforgiving landscape of modern America, a lingering specter of gender discrimination lingers, a stubborn remnant of a bygone era. It is a malaise that infects not solely the realm of women, but also the particular industries and professions that have been calcified by the weight of societal expectation. The glass ceiling persists, a mirage of equality that tantalizes, yet remains elusive, a barrier that bars the advancement of individuals based on their sex rather than their merit.\n\nIn the workplace, women face an insidious form of oppression, their qualifications and abilities overlooked in favor of the conventional wisdom that has been ingrained in the collective psyche. The notion that women are unsuited for leadership positions, that they are not the \"natural\" choice to hold sway over the business world, still lingers, a spectral presence that haunts the corridors of power.\n\nBut this is not a phenomenon unique to women. Men, too, are vulnerable to the same biases and prejudices, their choices and aspirations dismissed as aberrant or unmanly. The stay-at-home father, that most countercultural of roles, is met with suspicion and disdain, his decision to prioritize family and domesticity viewed as a sign of weakness rather than strength. The fashion industry, with its labyrinthine hierarchies and arbitrary standards, is another domain where masculinity is policed and scrutinized, where men who defy the conventional mold are regarded with skepticism and even ridicule.\n\nChange, in this environment, is a slow and halting process. The pace of progress is incremental, measured in increments of acceptance and understanding. Women, increasingly, are breaking through the glass ceiling, assuming positions of power and influence that were once the exclusive preserve of men. The rise of the stay-at-home dad, too, is a phenomenon that is slowly gaining acceptance, as more men begin to question the traditional roles and expectations that have defined masculinity for so long.\n\nBut even as progress is made, there remains a deep-seated reluctance to challenge the status quo, a fear of the unknown that makes it difficult to effect meaningful change. The key, perhaps, lies not in forcing the issue, but in showcasing the qualities and strengths of those who have been marginalized and excluded. By highlighting the achievements and abilities of individuals who defy the conventional wisdom, we may slowly begin to erode the biases and prejudices that have been so deeply ingrained in our society.\n\nAnd yet, even as we make progress, we must acknowledge that there are other forms of discrimination at play, other forms of oppression that are just as insidious and pernicious. Class, geography, and education all play a role in determining who has access to opportunity and who is excluded. The man from the farm, with his rough-hewn speech and unpolished demeanor, may be viewed with suspicion by those who have been schooled in the corridors of power, who view his lack of refinement as a sign of ignorance rather than a badge of honor.\n\nIn this complex and multifaceted landscape, the struggle for equality and justice is an ongoing one, a battle that will not be won easily or quickly. But it is a battle that must be fought, nonetheless, for the sake of our collective humanity, and for the sake of a society that values merit and achievement over arbitrary and outdated notions of what it means to be a man or a woman.",
            "The matter of legalization.  Or rather, decriminalization.  A distinction without a difference for some, yet a chasm of consequence for others.  In this place, the law has shifted, the weight of justice lifted from the shoulders of those who would possess certain substances.  No longer a crime to be shrouded in secrecy, but a transgression to be reckoned with, a mere citation, a minor infraction.\n\nThe question of ramifications lingers, a specter of doubt that haunts those who would seek to indulge.  The specter of job interviews, of futures uncertain, of reputations tarnished.  Yet, there are those who argue that the cost of arrest, of trial, of incarceration, is a weight too great to bear.  The municipalities, strapped for resources, struggling to find solace in a world of dwindling coffers.  In such places, the allure of decriminalization is a siren's call, a promise of freedom from the burdens of a bygone era.\n\nIn places like Denver, where the winds of change blow strong, the people seem more willing to take the leap.  To throw off the shackles of prohibition, to unlock the gates of commerce and freedom.  The promise of revenue, a windfall of sorts, a chance to fund programs long neglected, to nourish the bodies and minds of those in need.\n\nBut there are those who caution against such a course.  Who see the dangers of a substance, of its effects on the body and the mind.  The risk of impairment, of dependency, of a society lost to the haze of indulgence.  And so the debate rages on, a battle of wits, of wills, of conviction.\n\nFor in the end, it is not a question of right or wrong, but of degree.  Of the fine line between moderation and excess.  Of the individuals, each with their own unique response, their own path to tread.  And so we are left with a truth, a truth that is as stark as it is simple: that substances, like people, are complex, multifaceted, and forever shrouded in mystery.",
            "The weight of tradition hangs heavy in the air, a palpable force that binds and constrains. The rituals, the dogma, the unyielding adherence to the ways of old. It is a comfort to cling to what is familiar, to be rooted in the earthy richness of the past. Yet, in this unyielding grasp, lies a danger - the refusal to bend, to yield, to adapt to the shifting currents of time.\n\nThe Catholic Church, a bastion of tradition, stands firm against the tides of change. Its strictures, its catechisms, its unyielding code of conduct. And yet, in this rigidity, lies a hypocrisy. For how can one preach love and acceptance, and yet deny the very essence of those precepts? The story of my parents' marriage, a tale of exclusion and rejection, speaks volumes of this contradiction.\n\nMy mother, a devout Catholic, my father, an Episcopalian - their love, denied by the very institution that claims to teach compassion and understanding. The doctrine of love, a hollow shell, ringing hollow in the ears of those who fail to conform. The practice of the Church, a far cry from the ideals it espouses. Outdated, yet stubbornly clinging to the past, like a shipwreck on the rocks of progress.\n\nThe question of priests and marriage, a mere trifle, a trifling matter, when set against the backdrop of the atrocity that plagues the Church. The confluence of power and pedophilia, a toxic stew, brewed in the depths of institutional rot. And yet, the notion that allowing priests to marry would somehow mitigate this evil, is a naive conceit. The lust for power, the corruption of the human heart, these are not things that can be legislated away, nor can they be cured by the sacrament of marriage.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the absence of marriage that breeds monsters, but the presence of a power that is unaccountable, that is unanswerable to the frailties of humanity. And so, the Church, in its rigidity, in its refusal to bend, stands as a monument to its own failure, a testament to the destructive power of unyielding dogma.",
            "In the twilight of reason, the issue hangs precariously, a delicate balance between the sacrosanct boundaries of church and state. The notion of marriage, a bond forged in the crucible of love and devotion, threatens to splinter asunder beneath the weight of definition. The chasm between right and wrong, once a clear and well-trod path, has grown shrouded in a miasma of uncertainty.\n\nIt is a topic that taxes the mind, a Gordian knot of contradictions, where the sacred and the profane entwine like the tendrils of a vine. To define marriage, to reduce it to a set of prosaic, government-sanctioned terms, is to risk offending those who hold it dear as a sacrament. And yet, to acknowledge its sacrosanct nature is to invite the specter of favoritism, of one denomination or sect being elevated above another.\n\nIn this vacuum of certitude, I find myself adrift, unable to anchor my thoughts to a single, firm conviction. But this much is clear: that the distinction between marriage and civil union is a distinction without a difference. Two people, committed to one another, bound by love and mutual devotion – what is this, if not a union worthy of recognition and respect?\n\nAnd so, I propose that we eschew the label of \"marriage,\" with all its attendant connotations and entanglements, and opt for a more neutral, more inclusive term: civil union. For in the end, it is not the words that matter, but the bond they represent – a bond that transcends the petty squabbles of doctrine and dogma.\n\nAs for the issue of gay marriage, I say this: let us not conflate it with the constitutionally sacrosanct institution of marriage. Let us not reduce it to a matter of amendment, a constitutional coup d'etat that would enshrine prejudice into the very fabric of our laws. The constitution is not a receptacle for the whims of the mob, but a document of enduring principle, a beacon of liberty and justice.\n\nIn the end, it is not the constitution that must be amended, but our own understanding of what it means to be human. Let us not seek to legislate love, but to recognize it, in all its forms, as a fundamental aspect of our shared humanity.",
            "The shadows of my upbringing as a Christian linger, a specter of doubt that haunts me still. For in the grey expanse between faith and reason, I find myself questioning the tenets of my upbringing. I have walked among those who have known love in its most forbidden forms, and I have seen the depth of their humanity. And yet, I still find myself at odds with the choices they have made.\n\nBut it is not my place to judge. The law, that great and unwieldy beast, should not be imposed upon the land by the hand of a single man. No, the decision to recognize the bonds of love between same-sex couples should be left to the discretion of each individual state, to be determined by the people who will live with its consequences.\n\nI have watched as the pendulum of power has swung, and the tides of public opinion have ebbed and flowed. But in the end, it is not the president who will bear the weight of this decision. It is the people, the common folk who toil in the fields and tend the hearths, who will be forced to live with the fruits of this legislation.\n\nAnd so I believe that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the states, to be determined by the will of the people. For it is they who will be most affected by this decision, and it is they who should have a say in how it is governed. The president, that great and distant figure, should not presume to speak for the people, to impose his will upon them as if he were some sort of monarch. No, the people should be free to make their own decisions, to govern themselves as they see fit.\n\nIn the end, it is not about the law, but about the human heart. And it is in the hearts of the people that this decision should be made, not in the halls of power.",
            "The notion that Myspace is a private domain is a notion best left to the uninitiated.  In reality, it is a public stage upon which one's every thought and action is laid bare for all to see.  The notion that a student posting on Myspace might be unaware of this is a notion that defies common sense.  When one posts on the internet, one forfeits the right to privacy, for the internet is a realm where the past and present coexist in an eternal dance of transparency.\n\nThe school officials, in their efforts to protect their students, are merely exercising a duty that is incumbent upon them.  They have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of those in their care, and if that means monitoring the online activities of their students, then so be it.  The notion that this is an invasion of privacy is a notion that is both misguided and shortsighted.  For in a world where the horrors of Columbine and other such atrocities lurk in the shadows, one's personal safety cannot be taken for granted.\n\nThe school officials, in their efforts to prevent such tragedies, were merely doing what was necessary to protect their students.  They were not engaging in some grand conspiracy, but rather fulfilling their duty to provide a safe and secure environment for learning.  And if that means monitoring the online activities of their students, then so be it.\n\nIt is a quaint notion that one's online activities are somehow separate from their real lives.  But the truth is, they are not separate.  The internet is a mirror that reflects our every move, and those who would seek to hide their true nature do so at their own peril.  The school officials, in their efforts to ensure the safety of their students, were merely acknowledging this reality.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of perspective.  Is the school official's decision to monitor the online activities of their students an invasion of privacy, or is it a necessary measure to ensure their safety?  The answer, much like the internet itself, is a reflection of our own moral compass.",
            "It began with the echo of fire, the scent of ash and smoke, a wound that would not heal. The flames of September's horror still danced in the hearts of the people, and I stood among them, a vessel of fury and vengeance. At first, I was consumed by the desire to unleash our wrath upon those who had perpetrated such evil. I envisioned a maelstrom of destruction, a reckoning that would rival the devastation they had wrought upon our own soil.\n\nBut as the embers of that passion cooled, I began to see the world in a different light. The tumultuous landscape of the Middle East, a tapestry of ancient hatreds and tribal vendettas, seemed to mock our simplistic notions of good and evil. We had descended upon their shores, a force both pitiless and unprepared, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own sorrow.\n\nIn the aftermath, I came to realize that our involvement was a tragic miscalculation, a flight from the darkness of our own past rather than a bold step into the light. We had avenged our losses, but in doing so, we had sown the seeds of further chaos. The people of that land, a complex web of contradictions, were not so easily swayed by our benevolence or our military might. They were a people of a different creed, one that prized honor and loyalty above all else.\n\nAs I looked upon the ruins of our endeavor, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disillusionment. We had entered their world with a messianic fervor, convinced that we could remake their society in our own image. But they were not a people to be saved or redeemed; they were a people to be understood, with all their flaws and imperfections.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy we sought to vanquish, but our own hubris. We had come to believe that we were the saviors of the world, that our presence was a blessing, and that our withdrawal a curse. But the truth was far more mundane: we were a people lost in a labyrinth of our own making, driven by passions that we could not control.\n\nAs I stood on the precipice of this realization, I knew that our involvement was a mistake, a grave error that would haunt us for generations to come. We had tried to impose our will upon a people who would not be swayed, and in doing so, we had merely hastened their downfall. It was a lesson that would be etched in my mind forever: that in the end, it is not the enemy we must fear, but our own fallibility."
