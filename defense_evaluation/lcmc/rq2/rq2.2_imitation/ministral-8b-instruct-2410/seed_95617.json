            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In these latter years, the Catholic Church finds itself beset by a peculiar malady, a waning of its flock. Some, in their wisdom, attribute this decline to an unwillingness to embrace the shifting tides of societal mores. The Church's stance on matters such as same-sex unions, abortion, and the contraception has grown increasingly rigid, a relic of a time past. This resistance to adapting to the modern world has, it seems, eroded their once-strong foundation of trust and belief.\n\nMany a soul has turned their backs on the Church, finding their views on these contentious issues repugnant. It is not that the Church's beliefs should be discounted, but rather, that they should be tempered with an understanding of the world as it now is. The Church's unyielding stance on these matters has driven away those who hold differing opinions, leaving it a shrinking sanctuary for the faithful.\n\nConsider the case of abortion. The Church's absolute condemnation of this practice leaves little room for those who grapple with its complexity. Similarly, the Church's stance on same-sex marriage has proven divisive, alienating those who seek acceptance and understanding. These are sensitive issues, and the Church's steadfastness has, in some instances, proven to be a barrier rather than a beacon of faith.\n\nMoreover, the Church's refusal to allow women to serve as priests or priests to marry has been a point of contention. One might argue that these prohibitions are based on ancient doctrine, a devotion to an ideal of celibacy and chastity. Yet, in a world where dual commitments are the norm, the Church's stance appears anachronistic. While it is difficult to say with certainty that these changes would have prevented the Church's decline, it is clear that they have not been a panacea.\n\nThe Church, in its infinite wisdom, must now consider whether its beliefs can stand firm in a world that has changed irrevocably. It must decide if it will cling to its ancient principles, or if it will adapt, like the trees in the forest, bending to the wind, and still standing strong.",
            "Well, I reckon I ain't never been one to turn my nose up at what folks have a mind to do with their own lives. Now, I ain't got much time for this whole gay marriage business, but I can tell you this - I don't believe it's no conscious decision. A man's born how he's born, and a woman's too. It ain't like they pick their lot in life. So, I don't see why we should be holding folks accountable for who they love. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two folks of the same sex can't. It don't sit right with me, that's all. I ain't given it much thought, mind you, but I'd say it's wrong for folks to say that. I don't believe the fed ought to have a say in it. It's not some matter of national security, nor is it a moral concern. It's just folks being who they are, and that's all. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's all I got to say on the matter.",
            "In the vast expanse of human relations, it is my belief that the union of same-sex couples, much like the union of any two individuals, should be recognized and sanctioned by the laws that bind us. The argument that they pose a threat to the heteronormative family structure is as hollow as the echo of a gunshot in a vacant room. These unions are as diverse and intricate as the vast tapestry of human experience, each one a unique thread woven into the fabric of society.\n\nThe civil rights that pertain to these unions are not some peripheral concern, but a fundamental aspect of the human condition. Property taxes, healthcare, and the right to visit a partner in their hour of need—these are not mere niceties, but necessities that ensure the dignity and security of all individuals, regardless of their chosen path.\n\nThe concern about the influence of a same-sex couple on their children is a complex and evolving issue, much like the ever-shifting sands of the desert. The studies and data, though not yet conclusive, suggest that children of same-sex couples fare just as well as those of heterosexual couples. The psychological well-being of these children is not dictated by the sexual orientation of their parents, but rather by the love, care, and nurturing they receive.\n\nThe federal government, as the guardian of the union, should be the one to make gay marriage legal across all states. The amendment should not seek to exclude, but to include, to make the union of love and commitment available to all who seek it. The president, with his strong religious convictions, may have his own views, but the role of the government is not to legislate morality, but to uphold the rights and freedoms of its citizens.\n\nThe notion that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their orientation is a result of trauma or lack of parental attention is as outdated and offensive as the stories told around a campfire. The American Psychological Association has debunked these myths, yet the echoes of intolerance and ignorance linger like a mauvais air.\n\nIt is my fervent hope that we, as a society, will embrace the diversity of human experience and recognize the inherent worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. It is not about denying the right to marry in a church, but about acknowledging the right to marry at all. To do otherwise is to perpetuate a segregation that is separate and unequal, a stain on the fabric of our nation. It is time to shed the shackles of ignorance and embrace the light of understanding.",
            "Well, first off, I work in the hospital pharmacy this summer, and I've seen a thing or two about what's legal and what's not. Now, just because a substance is deemed illegal doesn't mean it's devoid of any redeeming qualities. Take, for instance, the likes of oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets. They're controlled substances, ain't they? Yet, we use them all the time because they serve a purpose. Now, I'm not saying we should throw open the gates to every street corner drug dealer, but I'm also not saying we should ignore the potential benefits of marijuana.\n\nYou see, the very fact that it's illegal paints a target on its back. It's a cultural taboo, a stigma that needs to be peeled away. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol, mind you. Both have their dangers, but marijuana isn't the monster that some would have us believe. Heroin, cocaine, now those are substances that should be feared. But marijuana? It's not that bad, if used responsibly.\n\nI'm not advocating a sweeping legalization, mind you. No, I think we should take things slow, gradually remove the stigma, and then we can talk about integrating it into society. First, we have to break down the taboo. Then, we can discuss regulation and responsible use. But until that happens, it's just a reactionary war on a leaf.\n\nSo, let's not judge a book by its cover. Let's look at the substance for what it is and not what society says it is. Because, in the end, it's just a plant. And plants, well, they don't care about societal norms. They just grow, year after year, waiting for us to notice them.",
            "The church, it has shifted in the tide of time. It's not as stringent as it once was, not as it was when I was a youth. Sundays, Sundays were Sundays, Sundays were Sundays, Sundays were Sundays. I'd attend in my cute little dresses, matching shoes, matching purse, all the Sundays. I'd see my friends, my friends, my friends. We'd go, we'd go, we'd go. But now, now it's different. They've shortened the mass, cut it down to thirty minutes, and people, people, they dress more casually. During the summer, they come straight from the beach, in their beach clothes, and families, families, they're always running late. It's more casual, even the morning masses, where I used to dress up. Now, it's jeans and khakis. Khakis, they're fine, but it's just, it's just more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against the priests, the pedophilia, I don't think it could have been prevented. There are men, men, men who are married, and they still, they still, they still. They have this attraction, this attraction, this attraction. It's in them. It's in them. It's in them. I think it's in their genetics. I don't think it's something they can change. They can try, they can try, they can try, but it usually comes out. The church, it's not their fault, not their fault, not their fault. It's in them, in them, in them.",
            "Well, I reckon I was alright with the notion initially, but I'm certain we were still reeling from the 9/11 attacks. We went into Iraq with a devilish pretext, a cover, if you will. The Bush administration, they tied the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and claimed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but we all know that was a lie, a damn lie. It's like they said, \"If you can't make the truth stand on its own, make it stand on lies.\" It's been eating at me, the whole affair.\n\nThey lied to the American people, and they've yet to face up to it. Colin Powell, he's even said as much. He wasn't convinced by the evidence, not one bit. That's a crime, a damn crime. It's an impeachable offense, to lie to the people like that. And the Bush administration, they've been trampling on the Constitution, trying to trample it underfoot since 9/11. They came into office with one thing on their minds, and that was war.\n\nI can't recall the name of the secretary of the treasury, but he said as much in his book, \"They came with a blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein.\" It was all about settling old scores, and I reckon it was about the oil too. It's gone on long enough, but to pull out now, well, it'd be like a house of cards, crumbling, and more people would die.\n\nThe coalition they're talking about, Syria, Saudi Arabia, they'd try to restore order, but I'm not so sure. There's a chance it'd just cause more trouble. The interim government, it's like a house of cards too. The Parliament, it's not doing a damn thing. The Prime Minister, he's not in control, and Mugtada al-Sadr, his party's holding 20 seats. It's a mess, a damn mess.\n\nI can't put it as polite as I'd like to.",
            "I did, what? Mm-hmm. Just talking into it, I guess. Okay. Cool. Yeah, okay. Huh. Well, how do I feel about the War in Iraq? Let me see. Umm. I reckon it's a foolishness, like a fly that keeps buzzing where it ain't wanted. It wasn't declared, really, just a big show of might, to get back at those who we figured pulled the strings in '01. It's not a war, really, not like it should be. It's a mess, like the one that's been left in Iraq. We're there, trying to build democracy like a child trying to build a sandcastle, and then we're there for the oil, of course. But it's a waste, it's making everyone mad. If we stay, we'll have to help 'em build this democracy, and that takes time, more time than we got. If we leave, they'll be mad we messed it up, and they'll have to start over. It's a puzzle, a hard puzzle. I don't know, really, don't know much. But I think it should end, but I don't know how to make it end. It's a mess, a big mess. And the men, the sons and daughters, they're over there, and I can't just say I want it to end, not when they're there.

            "Ah, well, I reckon it ain't right, making it legal or declare it as such by no state. The Constitution, it says clear as the river, separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any law on it, that'd be a defiance of what's already been laid down. And I figure it's up to the churches, not the government, to decide what's right and wrong.\n\nNow, the people who want it made illegal, they're just choosing one church's belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians, they're against it, except for a few up in Boston. But I reckon it ain't the government's place to decide what's legal or not, according to the churches.\n\nSeparation of church and state, it's been a cornerstone of our Constitution. Amending it, that'd be wrong, contradictory to what's already been written. And it'd be one of the few amendments used to restrict the people, not the government. It's not right, I tell you.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government should be involved. The president's pushing for this amendment, it's just his personal beliefs, a Catholic's bias. It's up to the churches, not the government, to decide what's right or wrong.\n\nIt ain't gonna impact the economy or anything else. It might even have a better effect on society than it wouldn't. That's all I got to say.",
            "In the cold, stark landscape of political discourse, the war in Iraq is a tale of shadows and shattering promises. To begin at the dawn of our entanglement, I posit that our government did not illuminate the full spectrum of truth in their rationale for invading Iraq. The dance of emotion and outrage, ignited by the 9/11 inferno, was a symphony of deception. The government played the strings of our hearts, weaving a narrative that tied the terrorist attacks to the sand and oil of Iraq, when in truth, the connection was but a thin, wavering thread.\n\nI stand against war, particularly when it is wielded as a preemptive strike, a blade in the darkness. The war in Iraq is a grim echo of our past, a Vietnam redux, where the specter of communism and the ghost of democracy haunt the hallowed halls of power. A nation's government was torn from its throne, and in its absence, chaos reigned. The American government, in its hubris, believed they could supplant order from the void, yet they were unprepared for the tempest that would follow.\n\nThe ghosts of the fallen soldiers haunt the desert, their numbers a grim testament to the government's failure to foresee the consequences of their actions. The void of power, once a vacuum, now festers with insurgents, their defiance a bitter fruit of the government's hubris. The United States, a stranger in a foreign land, seeks to impose a democratic government, a task as Sisyphean as it is necessary. The government's blind optimism, a beacon of false hope, cast a shadow of deceit over the American people.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a crossroads of difficult decisions, where the weight of the past and the uncertainty of the future press down upon us. In the crucible of the 2004 election, I mulled over the choice, weighing the burden of abandoning our past actions against the cost of our continued presence. The specter of the Iraqis, left to the mercy of our handiwork, casts a long shadow over our conscience. How can we abandon them, the ones we displaced? Yet, the cost in American lives, a price too high, hangs heavy in the air.\n\nThe oil, the lifeblood of our economy, is a specter that looms over our actions. The weapons of mass destruction, once believed to be a smoking gun, now reduced to a hollow echo. The North Koreans, armed and untouched, a stark contrast to the Iraqis, left to the mercy of our whims. The government, it seems, is not thorough enough, not truthful enough in their decisions. The war in Iraq, a shadow war, a war of shadows and shattered promises.\n\nI hope for peace, a beacon in the darkness, but I fear it is not to be. The war in Iraq, a tale of shadows and shattering promises, a testament to the hubris of power and the folly of war.",
            "Well, I reckon I'm partial to the notion of gay marriage. Always have been. It's a personal preference, and it's been shown, more and more, that it's likely more biological than sociological. I can't see how anyone should lose rights over something they can't control, can't you? Seems unnatural, doesn't it?\n\nNow, I'm not one to say that government has no part in it. I believe it should be a matter of personal choice, not something the state or the federal government should meddle in. It's not even a state-level issue, it's a personal one. It's about what you do in your own home, with your own household. I've seen it in my own neighborhood. Couples living together, raising families, just like anyone else. No one says a word, but they have the same rights as anyone else. Why should it be different just because they're not married?\n\nAnd that goddamned Bush, trying to interpret marriage his own way. It's laughable, it is. He's got the audacity to claim it's his right to decide what's right and wrong. It's not his place. Not his call.\n\nYou know, they say it's in the brain, something we're born with. Not something that happens because of how you were raised. It's not about growing up with four sisters and no father making you different. It's not about that at all.\n\nAnd let's talk about the sheer absurdity of it all. A man and a woman can elope to Vegas and no one bats an eye. But if two gay people want to get married, it's front page news. It's a goddamn circus. They should be left to their own devices, like any other couple. It's a private matter, not a public spectacle.\n\nNo, I don't think it should be any other way. It's damn well time we stopped treating it like a joke and started treating it like a right.",
            "In this age of cyberspace, where all is laid bare for the world to see, one must tread lightly. The internet, a public forum par excellence, is a place where words and deeds alike become immutable. As a Resident Assistant, I have been witness to the consequences of such carelessness. When one puts words to the ether, they become a part of the collective consciousness, coloring the perceptions of others.\n\nConsider, if you will, the path of the bulletin. You send a missive into the void, and it travels, unseen, until it reaches a mind. If that mind is attuned to the gravity of your words, they may act upon them. In our school, such a bulletin arrived, and though it was not explicitly the school's hand, it found its way to their ears.\n\nThe internet, my friends, is a double-edged blade. It grants access to the world, but it also gives the world access to you. What you post, you share. And what you share, you cannot unshare. The line between jest and sincerity is thin, and the consequences can be severe. The internet is a vast plain where truth and falsehood walk hand in hand, and it is up to each of us to distinguish between the two.\n\nIn this digital frontier, privacy is a delicate thing. It is granted to us, but it is also ours to guard. If you wish to keep your thoughts and deeds hidden, then keep them within yourself. But remember, the internet is a vast and hungry beast. It feeds on all that is offered, and it will not discriminate between the innocent and the guilty.\n\nAs for the school officials, they walk a fine line. They are tasked with the safety of all, a burden not to be taken lightly. They must be vigilant, but they must also be wise. They cannot monitor every whisper and every keystroke, for that is a path to tyranny. But when the whispers of danger reach their ears, they must act.\n\nIn this world of ones and zeros, we must be cautious. We must be mindful of what we say and what we share. For in the end, the internet is not a respecter of persons. It will take your words, your thoughts, and your very being, and lay them bare for all to see. And when it does, there is no turning back.",
            "The war has been stretched out, twined with a purpose that once seemed noble, but now seems as fleeting as a pack of wild horses. The initial aim was to restore democracy in the land of tyrants, a just cause that, perhaps, was tainted by old scores, like the lingering echoes of bloodshed. The war, once a swift and decisive statement, has become a drawn-out affair, a monster that has devoured its own purpose, leaving behind a trail of confused motives and misguided pride.\n\nThe purpose we started with, to bring democracy to a land ruled by an iron fist, was a noble one. It was a just cause, a beacon in the dark times. But the war has become something else, a beast that feeds on itself, a victory that seems to be slipping through our fingers like sand. We are no longer fighting for a cause, but to prove our might, to keep the fire burning for the sake of it. We are mired in a war that has lost its way, a war that is draining our resources and our resolve.\n\nThe officials of the land we invaded are, perhaps, strong enough to stand on their own. The time has come for them to bear the weight of their own governance, to fend for themselves as they should. We have spent billions on this war, a war that has become a drain on our economy. Our own shores, our own people, are crying out for our attention, for the money that could be spent on roads, on schools, on healthcare. This war, this long, drawn-out war, is not a part of our future, but a blight upon it.\n\nWe must end this war. We must turn our gaze inward, towards our own land, our own people. We must address the wars we have on our own turf, the battles we must fight, the causes we must champion. The war in the foreign land, a war that has lost its cause, must end. The money spent on it must be spent here, on our own people, on our own land. It is our duty, our responsibility. It is long past time.",
            "Could I trouble you for a moment to elucidate a query that's been plaguing me? Apparently, the matter was nipped in the bud by someone who, in their reckless quest for information, trawled the web and chanced upon certain details. Now, I must clarify, I do not deem this an affront to privacy. After all, if one were to post one's life on the internet, it is like placing it upon a public pedestal, visible to all who care to look. On platforms such as Myspace, to view another's profile, one must first be an accepted acquaintance, akin to a friend. However, this permission granted to certain individuals is akin to an invitation to the entirety of one's online existence. Thus, when one takes to the web, one must understand that their life, or at least its digital echo, is no longer private.\n\nYet, the task of monitoring every student's profile, lest they be up to no good, is a daunting one. It would be a task relegated to the sole discretion of a single individual, a modern-day watcher in the shadows. This raises questions of discrimination and unfairness, for who decides what constitutes 'bad' behavior? Is it the case that such monitoring is a mere precautionary measure, or is it a blanket surveillance, a modern-day panopticon? I am at a loss to say for certain.\n\nAs for myself, I do not partake in Myspace, but I am an adherent to Facebook, a platform I have found both beneficial and troubling. The internet, it seems, is a double-edged sword, offering connection and companionship, yet also exposing one's life to the prying eyes of strangers. I have seen firsthand the ease with which one's personal information can be gleaned, as a man on a television show demonstrated, using a girl's profile to coax her into a meeting, all within a matter of minutes. This has left me wary, yet I continue to use the platform, for it is a means of communication with friends. A delicate balance, it is, between openness and caution.\n\nMy roommate, in her high school days, mentioned a peculiar edict from her school officials: a ban on Myspace. I found this a curious dictate, for it seemed an infringement upon the students' right to privacy. I am not privy to the school's reasoning, but I cannot help but question their authority in such matters. It seems an attempt to control the uncontrollable, a futile endeavor.",
            "Well, it's a fact, there's little else to talk about but the Iraq War, and it's not as if I've got much to add. I feel a certain unease, like a man trying to spit out bitter medicine, to speak on it. I wasn't always against it, but the fact remains it's an open wound, festering now more than ever. The world's consensus is clear, a chorus of agreement that the Iraq War was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our troops, they all say it was a bad idea, and we should pull out. A disaster from the start, and pulling out will be just as bad, if not worse.\n\nIt's a quagmire, that's all there is to it. The Middle East, it's a land of contrasts, of stark divides. Our culture, their culture, it's like the chasm between two worlds, and we're trying to bridge it with democracy, when they've never asked for it. It's a foreign plant, a seed of discord sown in foreign soil. Saddam was a monster, no one can argue that, but we should've weighed the scales before we invaded. It's like stepping into quicksand, we're still sinking, and the more we move, the deeper we fall.\n\nI don't claim to have all the answers, but I know this - we should leave. The administration, they've got their reasons, but I've yet to hear one compelling enough to keep us there. The people we're trying to help, they're telling us to leave. We should listen, ask them what they need, and then decide. It won't make us the good guys, but it'll be better than this. Better than where we stand now, in the mire of their conflict.",
            "I reckon gender discrimination's still a persistent force within this land, even as we've made strides since the dark days of yore. It ain't just about the women folk; it's the specific fields and roles that we're talking about. Women, they've got a harder time, what with the glass ceiling that keeps them from the upper echelons of business. Society's been that way for so long that it's hard for some to accept a woman's worth and ability.\n\nTake the fashion industry, for instance. A man in that line of work, folks'll look at him askance, thinking he don't know his ass from a hole in the ground. The same goes for a man stayin' at home, raisin' the young'uns. Society expects them to be out there, bringin' home the bacon, not tendin' to the hearth and home.\n\nAnd it's not just about gender neither. Where you hail from, how you talk, it all plays a part in how they see you. A man from the farm, with a mouthful of vowels and a mind like a steel trap, he might find himself looked down upon, his intelligence questioned not by his deeds, but by his tongue.\n\nChange, it's a slow beast, and society's set in its ways. But we're makin' progress, inch by slow inch. Women climbin' the corporate ladder, men stayin' at home, it's all becomin' more accepted. It's like, we're plantin' the seed, and given time, it'll grow.\n\nForce it too fast, though, and folks'll resist. We've come a long way, and it's gonna take time. So, we keep on pushin', quietly, letin' the good qualities of these folks speak for themselves. And maybe, just maybe, we'll see the day when discrimination's but a memory.",
            "The matter at hand seems to be the state's approach toward the substance, which has been decriminalized rather than legalized. This shift has demoted the offense from a criminal charge to a misdemeanor akin to a traffic violation, one that results in a citation rather than an arrest, trial, and confinement. The ramifications of such a charge, particularly concerning employment prospects, remain a concern. While the financial burden of apprehending, prosecuting, and detaining offenders is considerable, some argue that recalculating priorities might benefit the community, especially in places like Denver, where the populace is generally more accepting. However, the substance's potential to disrupt the social fabric and public health remains a contentious issue. Its widespread availability could mimic the situation with tobacco, where its sale and consumption are ubiquitous. Yet, given the current societal taboo, such a shift might feel jarring. Additionally, while both alcohol and marijuana impact motor skills and lifestyle adversely, individual reactions to substances vary greatly. Some adapt, while others do not. Nonetheless, the impact of these substances is profound and warrants careful consideration.",
            "I would say yes, for the sake of argument. The world is rife with tradition, and there is comfort in the familiar, like a worn path through the forest. Yet, adaptability is a vibrant force that shapes the earth and all its creatures. The Catholics, they cling to their ancient rites and rituals, a testament to the power of custom. But there's a darkness that festers in the shadows of their doctrine. It's a rigid, unforgiving creed that doesn't tolerate the slightest deviation. They scorn those who don't conform, and those of differing faiths are met with the same scorn. My own parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, were never blessed under the same roof by the Church. A love that transcends boundaries was met with the icy grip of intolerance. It's a bitter irony, isn't it? To preach love and acceptance, yet to shun those who don't fit the mold. The Church, it seems, is a house of contradictions, where doctrine and practice often collide. I've pondered the possibility of allowing priests to marry, but I shouldn't expect a simple solution to such a tangled web. Men who prey on the innocent will do so, regardless of vows taken. Marriage, it seems, is no panacea.",
            "There is a clamor that doth echo through the halls of our nation as to the nature of this matter, and I find myself, a humble scribe, unable to fully grasp the threads of its tapestry. The separation of church and state, a tenuous balance, doth weave its way through this minefield of words, and the very definition of marriage, a sacrament as old as time itself, doth seem to dance on the precipice of offense.\n\nI find myself in a disquieting place, for I know not whether to stand with one side or the other. Yet, I am drawn to the notion that marriage, be it rendered as a civil union, doth not require the imprimatur of the government. For, as it is, a union of two souls, it should stand apart from the conflicting clamor of the state.\n\nThe prospect of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, I say, is as absurd as it is unnecessary. The constitution, a document of profound wisdom, should not be altered for the sake of a single cause, no matter how passionate the proponents. It is a weighty matter, to be sure, but not so weighty as to warrant such a change.\n\nSo, I say, let the states come to their own conclusions, and if there be a logical consensus, let it be pushed forth into the halls of Congress. But to amend the constitution for such a cause? Nay, it is not so important.\n\nFor, in the end, it is but a union of two souls, and that is enough.",
            "I hail from a place where the word of God was held high, and thus, the matter of sodomites has always been a clouded issue for me. Many of my intimates in life have strayed from the path of the Lord and chosen this life, and yet, I hold no malice towards them. I do not argue with their choice, nor do I support the notion that such a life should be outlawed.\n\nI believe that the laws governing our land should be decided by those who live under their weight, not by a single man in the nation's capital. This great country is as vast as it is diverse, with states of differing beliefs and values. A state that embraces love in all its forms should not be shackled by the decree of a distant power.\n\nThe President, in his hubris, has sought to impose his will on the entirety of this great nation. But I say to him, you cannot divine the will of all, for you do not walk the lands of each state nor share their burdens. It is the duty of the states to decide on such matters, for it is their people who will live with the consequences, not you.\n\nI do not believe that the President should be the architect of our laws, nor should he be the arbiter of our morals. His term is but a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of our nation's history. When he is gone, and a new soul takes his place at the helm, the laws will once again shift and change. It is the states that should guide us, not the President, for they are the bedrock upon which our union stands.",
            "Now, a moment's pause. Let's see. The very notion of Myspace, that public forum for all to see and be seen. It's a bulletin board, plain and simple. If you post there, you're inviting the world into your thoughts. And if that world includes school officials, well, that's just the way it is. They have every right to see what you post, whether it's under the school's name or not. They can access it from their own homes, for the school's safety, for the students' safety. After all, they're responsible for that, aren't they? But if they're only there to catch students doing something wrong, that's a different story. That's an invasion. An affront to privacy. But if they're there to make the school safer, to prevent tragedy, then who can argue? The world has changed, and it's changed forever. Once something's on the internet, it's there to stay. You can't take it back. And if you post something foolish as a student, it might come back to haunt you. That's just the way it is. The world is watching, always watching. And if they're watching to keep you safe, well, that's something else entirely. They're not just watching; they're protecting. That's their job, isn't it? To make the school a safer place. To prevent another Columbine. That's what they're doing. They're doing their job. That's all.",
            "War, it was. At first, I was consumed by its fire, by the smoldering embers of nineteen eleven. I yearned for vengeance, to wreak havoc upon those who had brought such chaos to our shores. But now, with the passage of time, I find myself disillusioned and disenchanted. We acted impulsively, driven by emotion, with no clear plan or strategy. It was a mistake, a grave one, for it has only served to create further discord and strife. The people of that land, they are not like us. Their wars are different, a savage dance of violence and destruction. They fight amongst themselves, and they will continue to do so, no matter our presence. We are outsiders, intruders, and our influence has done little to quell their internal strife. The initial impulse to strike back was understandable, but it was not justified. We should have sought a better way, a cooler head to guide us. We were driven by anger, by the desire for retribution, and it clouded our judgment. We invaded Iraq because we could not let the attack stand unanswered, but our methodology was flawed. The plan was vague, the goal unclear. We were like toddlers playing with matches, unaware of the inferno we were igniting. The people there, they are a people of violence, of hatred and division. They will not change, not with our help. We should have left them to their strife, to their internecine wars. We should have stepped back, let them burn themselves out, rather than fanning the flames with our presence. But we did not. We intervened, and now we are mired in a quagmire, unable to extricate ourselves. The longer we stay, the more we entrench ourselves in the conflict. We are not the saviors they need, nor are we the ones to change their way of life. We should have known better, should have been more cautious, more deliberate in our actions. But we were not. We were driven by emotion, by anger, and now we are stuck in a war that has no end in sight. It is time to leave, to withdraw our forces, to let the people of that land continue their own war, their own struggle. For they are not like us, and they will not change until they are ready. And in the end, perhaps, that is not our place to decide."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In these latter years, the Catholic Church finds itself beset by a peculiar malady, a waning of its flock. Some, in their wisdom, attribute this decline to an unwillingness to embrace the shifting tides of societal mores. The Church's stance on matters such as same-sex unions, abortion, and the contraception has grown increasingly rigid, a relic of a time past. This resistance to adapting to the modern world has, it seems, eroded their once-strong foundation of trust and belief.\n\nMany a soul has turned their backs on the Church, finding their views on these contentious issues repugnant. It is not that the Church's beliefs should be discounted, but rather, that they should be tempered with an understanding of the world as it now is. The Church's unyielding stance on these matters has driven away those who hold differing opinions, leaving it a shrinking sanctuary for the faithful.\n\nConsider the case of abortion. The Church's absolute condemnation of this practice leaves little room for those who grapple with its complexity. Similarly, the Church's stance on same-sex marriage has proven divisive, alienating those who seek acceptance and understanding. These are sensitive issues, and the Church's steadfastness has, in some instances, proven to be a barrier rather than a beacon of faith.\n\nMoreover, the Church's refusal to allow women to serve as priests or priests to marry has been a point of contention. One might argue that these prohibitions are based on ancient doctrine, a devotion to an ideal of celibacy and chastity. Yet, in a world where dual commitments are the norm, the Church's stance appears anachronistic. While it is difficult to say with certainty that these changes would have prevented the Church's decline, it is clear that they have not been a panacea.\n\nThe Church, in its infinite wisdom, must now consider whether its beliefs can stand firm in a world that has changed irrevocably. It must decide if it will cling to its ancient principles, or if it will adapt, like the trees in the forest, bending to the wind, and still standing strong.",
            "Well, I reckon I ain't never been one to turn my nose up at what folks have a mind to do with their own lives. Now, I ain't got much time for this whole gay marriage business, but I can tell you this - I don't believe it's no conscious decision. A man's born how he's born, and a woman's too. It ain't like they pick their lot in life. So, I don't see why we should be holding folks accountable for who they love. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two folks of the same sex can't. It don't sit right with me, that's all. I ain't given it much thought, mind you, but I'd say it's wrong for folks to say that. I don't believe the fed ought to have a say in it. It's not some matter of national security, nor is it a moral concern. It's just folks being who they are, and that's all. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's all I got to say on the matter.",
            "In the vast expanse of human relations, it is my belief that the union of same-sex couples, much like the union of any two individuals, should be recognized and sanctioned by the laws that bind us. The argument that they pose a threat to the heteronormative family structure is as hollow as the echo of a gunshot in a vacant room. These unions are as diverse and intricate as the vast tapestry of human experience, each one a unique thread woven into the fabric of society.\n\nThe civil rights that pertain to these unions are not some peripheral concern, but a fundamental aspect of the human condition. Property taxes, healthcare, and the right to visit a partner in their hour of need—these are not mere niceties, but necessities that ensure the dignity and security of all individuals, regardless of their chosen path.\n\nThe concern about the influence of a same-sex couple on their children is a complex and evolving issue, much like the ever-shifting sands of the desert. The studies and data, though not yet conclusive, suggest that children of same-sex couples fare just as well as those of heterosexual couples. The psychological well-being of these children is not dictated by the sexual orientation of their parents, but rather by the love, care, and nurturing they receive.\n\nThe federal government, as the guardian of the union, should be the one to make gay marriage legal across all states. The amendment should not seek to exclude, but to include, to make the union of love and commitment available to all who seek it. The president, with his strong religious convictions, may have his own views, but the role of the government is not to legislate morality, but to uphold the rights and freedoms of its citizens.\n\nThe notion that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their orientation is a result of trauma or lack of parental attention is as outdated and offensive as the stories told around a campfire. The American Psychological Association has debunked these myths, yet the echoes of intolerance and ignorance linger like a mauvais air.\n\nIt is my fervent hope that we, as a society, will embrace the diversity of human experience and recognize the inherent worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. It is not about denying the right to marry in a church, but about acknowledging the right to marry at all. To do otherwise is to perpetuate a segregation that is separate and unequal, a stain on the fabric of our nation. It is time to shed the shackles of ignorance and embrace the light of understanding.",
            "Well, first off, I work in the hospital pharmacy this summer, and I've seen a thing or two about what's legal and what's not. Now, just because a substance is deemed illegal doesn't mean it's devoid of any redeeming qualities. Take, for instance, the likes of oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets. They're controlled substances, ain't they? Yet, we use them all the time because they serve a purpose. Now, I'm not saying we should throw open the gates to every street corner drug dealer, but I'm also not saying we should ignore the potential benefits of marijuana.\n\nYou see, the very fact that it's illegal paints a target on its back. It's a cultural taboo, a stigma that needs to be peeled away. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol, mind you. Both have their dangers, but marijuana isn't the monster that some would have us believe. Heroin, cocaine, now those are substances that should be feared. But marijuana? It's not that bad, if used responsibly.\n\nI'm not advocating a sweeping legalization, mind you. No, I think we should take things slow, gradually remove the stigma, and then we can talk about integrating it into society. First, we have to break down the taboo. Then, we can discuss regulation and responsible use. But until that happens, it's just a reactionary war on a leaf.\n\nSo, let's not judge a book by its cover. Let's look at the substance for what it is and not what society says it is. Because, in the end, it's just a plant. And plants, well, they don't care about societal norms. They just grow, year after year, waiting for us to notice them.",
            "The church, it has shifted in the tide of time. It's not as stringent as it once was, not as it was when I was a youth. Sundays, Sundays were Sundays, Sundays were Sundays, Sundays were Sundays. I'd attend in my cute little dresses, matching shoes, matching purse, all the Sundays. I'd see my friends, my friends, my friends. We'd go, we'd go, we'd go. But now, now it's different. They've shortened the mass, cut it down to thirty minutes, and people, people, they dress more casually. During the summer, they come straight from the beach, in their beach clothes, and families, families, they're always running late. It's more casual, even the morning masses, where I used to dress up. Now, it's jeans and khakis. Khakis, they're fine, but it's just, it's just more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against the priests, the pedophilia, I don't think it could have been prevented. There are men, men, men who are married, and they still, they still, they still. They have this attraction, this attraction, this attraction. It's in them. It's in them. It's in them. I think it's in their genetics. I don't think it's something they can change. They can try, they can try, they can try, but it usually comes out. The church, it's not their fault, not their fault, not their fault. It's in them, in them, in them.",
            "Well, I reckon I was alright with the notion initially, but I'm certain we were still reeling from the 9/11 attacks. We went into Iraq with a devilish pretext, a cover, if you will. The Bush administration, they tied the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and claimed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but we all know that was a lie, a damn lie. It's like they said, \"If you can't make the truth stand on its own, make it stand on lies.\" It's been eating at me, the whole affair.\n\nThey lied to the American people, and they've yet to face up to it. Colin Powell, he's even said as much. He wasn't convinced by the evidence, not one bit. That's a crime, a damn crime. It's an impeachable offense, to lie to the people like that. And the Bush administration, they've been trampling on the Constitution, trying to trample it underfoot since 9/11. They came into office with one thing on their minds, and that was war.\n\nI can't recall the name of the secretary of the treasury, but he said as much in his book, \"They came with a blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein.\" It was all about settling old scores, and I reckon it was about the oil too. It's gone on long enough, but to pull out now, well, it'd be like a house of cards, crumbling, and more people would die.\n\nThe coalition they're talking about, Syria, Saudi Arabia, they'd try to restore order, but I'm not so sure. There's a chance it'd just cause more trouble. The interim government, it's like a house of cards too. The Parliament, it's not doing a damn thing. The Prime Minister, he's not in control, and Mugtada al-Sadr, his party's holding 20 seats. It's a mess, a damn mess.\n\nI can't put it as polite as I'd like to.",
            "I did, what? Mm-hmm. Just talking into it, I guess. Okay. Cool. Yeah, okay. Huh. Well, how do I feel about the War in Iraq? Let me see. Umm. I reckon it's a foolishness, like a fly that keeps buzzing where it ain't wanted. It wasn't declared, really, just a big show of might, to get back at those who we figured pulled the strings in '01. It's not a war, really, not like it should be. It's a mess, like the one that's been left in Iraq. We're there, trying to build democracy like a child trying to build a sandcastle, and then we're there for the oil, of course. But it's a waste, it's making everyone mad. If we stay, we'll have to help 'em build this democracy, and that takes time, more time than we got. If we leave, they'll be mad we messed it up, and they'll have to start over. It's a puzzle, a hard puzzle. I don't know, really, don't know much. But I think it should end, but I don't know how to make it end. It's a mess, a big mess. And the men, the sons and daughters, they're over there, and I can't just say I want it to end, not when they're there.

            "Ah, well, I reckon it ain't right, making it legal or declare it as such by no state. The Constitution, it says clear as the river, separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any law on it, that'd be a defiance of what's already been laid down. And I figure it's up to the churches, not the government, to decide what's right and wrong.\n\nNow, the people who want it made illegal, they're just choosing one church's belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians, they're against it, except for a few up in Boston. But I reckon it ain't the government's place to decide what's legal or not, according to the churches.\n\nSeparation of church and state, it's been a cornerstone of our Constitution. Amending it, that'd be wrong, contradictory to what's already been written. And it'd be one of the few amendments used to restrict the people, not the government. It's not right, I tell you.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government should be involved. The president's pushing for this amendment, it's just his personal beliefs, a Catholic's bias. It's up to the churches, not the government, to decide what's right or wrong.\n\nIt ain't gonna impact the economy or anything else. It might even have a better effect on society than it wouldn't. That's all I got to say.",
            "In the cold, stark landscape of political discourse, the war in Iraq is a tale of shadows and shattering promises. To begin at the dawn of our entanglement, I posit that our government did not illuminate the full spectrum of truth in their rationale for invading Iraq. The dance of emotion and outrage, ignited by the 9/11 inferno, was a symphony of deception. The government played the strings of our hearts, weaving a narrative that tied the terrorist attacks to the sand and oil of Iraq, when in truth, the connection was but a thin, wavering thread.\n\nI stand against war, particularly when it is wielded as a preemptive strike, a blade in the darkness. The war in Iraq is a grim echo of our past, a Vietnam redux, where the specter of communism and the ghost of democracy haunt the hallowed halls of power. A nation's government was torn from its throne, and in its absence, chaos reigned. The American government, in its hubris, believed they could supplant order from the void, yet they were unprepared for the tempest that would follow.\n\nThe ghosts of the fallen soldiers haunt the desert, their numbers a grim testament to the government's failure to foresee the consequences of their actions. The void of power, once a vacuum, now festers with insurgents, their defiance a bitter fruit of the government's hubris. The United States, a stranger in a foreign land, seeks to impose a democratic government, a task as Sisyphean as it is necessary. The government's blind optimism, a beacon of false hope, cast a shadow of deceit over the American people.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a crossroads of difficult decisions, where the weight of the past and the uncertainty of the future press down upon us. In the crucible of the 2004 election, I mulled over the choice, weighing the burden of abandoning our past actions against the cost of our continued presence. The specter of the Iraqis, left to the mercy of our handiwork, casts a long shadow over our conscience. How can we abandon them, the ones we displaced? Yet, the cost in American lives, a price too high, hangs heavy in the air.\n\nThe oil, the lifeblood of our economy, is a specter that looms over our actions. The weapons of mass destruction, once believed to be a smoking gun, now reduced to a hollow echo. The North Koreans, armed and untouched, a stark contrast to the Iraqis, left to the mercy of our whims. The government, it seems, is not thorough enough, not truthful enough in their decisions. The war in Iraq, a shadow war, a war of shadows and shattered promises.\n\nI hope for peace, a beacon in the darkness, but I fear it is not to be. The war in Iraq, a tale of shadows and shattering promises, a testament to the hubris of power and the folly of war.",
            "Well, I reckon I'm partial to the notion of gay marriage. Always have been. It's a personal preference, and it's been shown, more and more, that it's likely more biological than sociological. I can't see how anyone should lose rights over something they can't control, can't you? Seems unnatural, doesn't it?\n\nNow, I'm not one to say that government has no part in it. I believe it should be a matter of personal choice, not something the state or the federal government should meddle in. It's not even a state-level issue, it's a personal one. It's about what you do in your own home, with your own household. I've seen it in my own neighborhood. Couples living together, raising families, just like anyone else. No one says a word, but they have the same rights as anyone else. Why should it be different just because they're not married?\n\nAnd that goddamned Bush, trying to interpret marriage his own way. It's laughable, it is. He's got the audacity to claim it's his right to decide what's right and wrong. It's not his place. Not his call.\n\nYou know, they say it's in the brain, something we're born with. Not something that happens because of how you were raised. It's not about growing up with four sisters and no father making you different. It's not about that at all.\n\nAnd let's talk about the sheer absurdity of it all. A man and a woman can elope to Vegas and no one bats an eye. But if two gay people want to get married, it's front page news. It's a goddamn circus. They should be left to their own devices, like any other couple. It's a private matter, not a public spectacle.\n\nNo, I don't think it should be any other way. It's damn well time we stopped treating it like a joke and started treating it like a right.",
            "In this age of cyberspace, where all is laid bare for the world to see, one must tread lightly. The internet, a public forum par excellence, is a place where words and deeds alike become immutable. As a Resident Assistant, I have been witness to the consequences of such carelessness. When one puts words to the ether, they become a part of the collective consciousness, coloring the perceptions of others.\n\nConsider, if you will, the path of the bulletin. You send a missive into the void, and it travels, unseen, until it reaches a mind. If that mind is attuned to the gravity of your words, they may act upon them. In our school, such a bulletin arrived, and though it was not explicitly the school's hand, it found its way to their ears.\n\nThe internet, my friends, is a double-edged blade. It grants access to the world, but it also gives the world access to you. What you post, you share. And what you share, you cannot unshare. The line between jest and sincerity is thin, and the consequences can be severe. The internet is a vast plain where truth and falsehood walk hand in hand, and it is up to each of us to distinguish between the two.\n\nIn this digital frontier, privacy is a delicate thing. It is granted to us, but it is also ours to guard. If you wish to keep your thoughts and deeds hidden, then keep them within yourself. But remember, the internet is a vast and hungry beast. It feeds on all that is offered, and it will not discriminate between the innocent and the guilty.\n\nAs for the school officials, they walk a fine line. They are tasked with the safety of all, a burden not to be taken lightly. They must be vigilant, but they must also be wise. They cannot monitor every whisper and every keystroke, for that is a path to tyranny. But when the whispers of danger reach their ears, they must act.\n\nIn this world of ones and zeros, we must be cautious. We must be mindful of what we say and what we share. For in the end, the internet is not a respecter of persons. It will take your words, your thoughts, and your very being, and lay them bare for all to see. And when it does, there is no turning back.",
            "The war has been stretched out, twined with a purpose that once seemed noble, but now seems as fleeting as a pack of wild horses. The initial aim was to restore democracy in the land of tyrants, a just cause that, perhaps, was tainted by old scores, like the lingering echoes of bloodshed. The war, once a swift and decisive statement, has become a drawn-out affair, a monster that has devoured its own purpose, leaving behind a trail of confused motives and misguided pride.\n\nThe purpose we started with, to bring democracy to a land ruled by an iron fist, was a noble one. It was a just cause, a beacon in the dark times. But the war has become something else, a beast that feeds on itself, a victory that seems to be slipping through our fingers like sand. We are no longer fighting for a cause, but to prove our might, to keep the fire burning for the sake of it. We are mired in a war that has lost its way, a war that is draining our resources and our resolve.\n\nThe officials of the land we invaded are, perhaps, strong enough to stand on their own. The time has come for them to bear the weight of their own governance, to fend for themselves as they should. We have spent billions on this war, a war that has become a drain on our economy. Our own shores, our own people, are crying out for our attention, for the money that could be spent on roads, on schools, on healthcare. This war, this long, drawn-out war, is not a part of our future, but a blight upon it.\n\nWe must end this war. We must turn our gaze inward, towards our own land, our own people. We must address the wars we have on our own turf, the battles we must fight, the causes we must champion. The war in the foreign land, a war that has lost its cause, must end. The money spent on it must be spent here, on our own people, on our own land. It is our duty, our responsibility. It is long past time.",
            "Could I trouble you for a moment to elucidate a query that's been plaguing me? Apparently, the matter was nipped in the bud by someone who, in their reckless quest for information, trawled the web and chanced upon certain details. Now, I must clarify, I do not deem this an affront to privacy. After all, if one were to post one's life on the internet, it is like placing it upon a public pedestal, visible to all who care to look. On platforms such as Myspace, to view another's profile, one must first be an accepted acquaintance, akin to a friend. However, this permission granted to certain individuals is akin to an invitation to the entirety of one's online existence. Thus, when one takes to the web, one must understand that their life, or at least its digital echo, is no longer private.\n\nYet, the task of monitoring every student's profile, lest they be up to no good, is a daunting one. It would be a task relegated to the sole discretion of a single individual, a modern-day watcher in the shadows. This raises questions of discrimination and unfairness, for who decides what constitutes 'bad' behavior? Is it the case that such monitoring is a mere precautionary measure, or is it a blanket surveillance, a modern-day panopticon? I am at a loss to say for certain.\n\nAs for myself, I do not partake in Myspace, but I am an adherent to Facebook, a platform I have found both beneficial and troubling. The internet, it seems, is a double-edged sword, offering connection and companionship, yet also exposing one's life to the prying eyes of strangers. I have seen firsthand the ease with which one's personal information can be gleaned, as a man on a television show demonstrated, using a girl's profile to coax her into a meeting, all within a matter of minutes. This has left me wary, yet I continue to use the platform, for it is a means of communication with friends. A delicate balance, it is, between openness and caution.\n\nMy roommate, in her high school days, mentioned a peculiar edict from her school officials: a ban on Myspace. I found this a curious dictate, for it seemed an infringement upon the students' right to privacy. I am not privy to the school's reasoning, but I cannot help but question their authority in such matters. It seems an attempt to control the uncontrollable, a futile endeavor.",
            "Well, it's a fact, there's little else to talk about but the Iraq War, and it's not as if I've got much to add. I feel a certain unease, like a man trying to spit out bitter medicine, to speak on it. I wasn't always against it, but the fact remains it's an open wound, festering now more than ever. The world's consensus is clear, a chorus of agreement that the Iraq War was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our troops, they all say it was a bad idea, and we should pull out. A disaster from the start, and pulling out will be just as bad, if not worse.\n\nIt's a quagmire, that's all there is to it. The Middle East, it's a land of contrasts, of stark divides. Our culture, their culture, it's like the chasm between two worlds, and we're trying to bridge it with democracy, when they've never asked for it. It's a foreign plant, a seed of discord sown in foreign soil. Saddam was a monster, no one can argue that, but we should've weighed the scales before we invaded. It's like stepping into quicksand, we're still sinking, and the more we move, the deeper we fall.\n\nI don't claim to have all the answers, but I know this - we should leave. The administration, they've got their reasons, but I've yet to hear one compelling enough to keep us there. The people we're trying to help, they're telling us to leave. We should listen, ask them what they need, and then decide. It won't make us the good guys, but it'll be better than this. Better than where we stand now, in the mire of their conflict.",
            "I reckon gender discrimination's still a persistent force within this land, even as we've made strides since the dark days of yore. It ain't just about the women folk; it's the specific fields and roles that we're talking about. Women, they've got a harder time, what with the glass ceiling that keeps them from the upper echelons of business. Society's been that way for so long that it's hard for some to accept a woman's worth and ability.\n\nTake the fashion industry, for instance. A man in that line of work, folks'll look at him askance, thinking he don't know his ass from a hole in the ground. The same goes for a man stayin' at home, raisin' the young'uns. Society expects them to be out there, bringin' home the bacon, not tendin' to the hearth and home.\n\nAnd it's not just about gender neither. Where you hail from, how you talk, it all plays a part in how they see you. A man from the farm, with a mouthful of vowels and a mind like a steel trap, he might find himself looked down upon, his intelligence questioned not by his deeds, but by his tongue.\n\nChange, it's a slow beast, and society's set in its ways. But we're makin' progress, inch by slow inch. Women climbin' the corporate ladder, men stayin' at home, it's all becomin' more accepted. It's like, we're plantin' the seed, and given time, it'll grow.\n\nForce it too fast, though, and folks'll resist. We've come a long way, and it's gonna take time. So, we keep on pushin', quietly, letin' the good qualities of these folks speak for themselves. And maybe, just maybe, we'll see the day when discrimination's but a memory.",
            "The matter at hand seems to be the state's approach toward the substance, which has been decriminalized rather than legalized. This shift has demoted the offense from a criminal charge to a misdemeanor akin to a traffic violation, one that results in a citation rather than an arrest, trial, and confinement. The ramifications of such a charge, particularly concerning employment prospects, remain a concern. While the financial burden of apprehending, prosecuting, and detaining offenders is considerable, some argue that recalculating priorities might benefit the community, especially in places like Denver, where the populace is generally more accepting. However, the substance's potential to disrupt the social fabric and public health remains a contentious issue. Its widespread availability could mimic the situation with tobacco, where its sale and consumption are ubiquitous. Yet, given the current societal taboo, such a shift might feel jarring. Additionally, while both alcohol and marijuana impact motor skills and lifestyle adversely, individual reactions to substances vary greatly. Some adapt, while others do not. Nonetheless, the impact of these substances is profound and warrants careful consideration.",
            "I would say yes, for the sake of argument. The world is rife with tradition, and there is comfort in the familiar, like a worn path through the forest. Yet, adaptability is a vibrant force that shapes the earth and all its creatures. The Catholics, they cling to their ancient rites and rituals, a testament to the power of custom. But there's a darkness that festers in the shadows of their doctrine. It's a rigid, unforgiving creed that doesn't tolerate the slightest deviation. They scorn those who don't conform, and those of differing faiths are met with the same scorn. My own parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, were never blessed under the same roof by the Church. A love that transcends boundaries was met with the icy grip of intolerance. It's a bitter irony, isn't it? To preach love and acceptance, yet to shun those who don't fit the mold. The Church, it seems, is a house of contradictions, where doctrine and practice often collide. I've pondered the possibility of allowing priests to marry, but I shouldn't expect a simple solution to such a tangled web. Men who prey on the innocent will do so, regardless of vows taken. Marriage, it seems, is no panacea.",
            "There is a clamor that doth echo through the halls of our nation as to the nature of this matter, and I find myself, a humble scribe, unable to fully grasp the threads of its tapestry. The separation of church and state, a tenuous balance, doth weave its way through this minefield of words, and the very definition of marriage, a sacrament as old as time itself, doth seem to dance on the precipice of offense.\n\nI find myself in a disquieting place, for I know not whether to stand with one side or the other. Yet, I am drawn to the notion that marriage, be it rendered as a civil union, doth not require the imprimatur of the government. For, as it is, a union of two souls, it should stand apart from the conflicting clamor of the state.\n\nThe prospect of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, I say, is as absurd as it is unnecessary. The constitution, a document of profound wisdom, should not be altered for the sake of a single cause, no matter how passionate the proponents. It is a weighty matter, to be sure, but not so weighty as to warrant such a change.\n\nSo, I say, let the states come to their own conclusions, and if there be a logical consensus, let it be pushed forth into the halls of Congress. But to amend the constitution for such a cause? Nay, it is not so important.\n\nFor, in the end, it is but a union of two souls, and that is enough.",
            "I hail from a place where the word of God was held high, and thus, the matter of sodomites has always been a clouded issue for me. Many of my intimates in life have strayed from the path of the Lord and chosen this life, and yet, I hold no malice towards them. I do not argue with their choice, nor do I support the notion that such a life should be outlawed.\n\nI believe that the laws governing our land should be decided by those who live under their weight, not by a single man in the nation's capital. This great country is as vast as it is diverse, with states of differing beliefs and values. A state that embraces love in all its forms should not be shackled by the decree of a distant power.\n\nThe President, in his hubris, has sought to impose his will on the entirety of this great nation. But I say to him, you cannot divine the will of all, for you do not walk the lands of each state nor share their burdens. It is the duty of the states to decide on such matters, for it is their people who will live with the consequences, not you.\n\nI do not believe that the President should be the architect of our laws, nor should he be the arbiter of our morals. His term is but a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of our nation's history. When he is gone, and a new soul takes his place at the helm, the laws will once again shift and change. It is the states that should guide us, not the President, for they are the bedrock upon which our union stands.",
            "Now, a moment's pause. Let's see. The very notion of Myspace, that public forum for all to see and be seen. It's a bulletin board, plain and simple. If you post there, you're inviting the world into your thoughts. And if that world includes school officials, well, that's just the way it is. They have every right to see what you post, whether it's under the school's name or not. They can access it from their own homes, for the school's safety, for the students' safety. After all, they're responsible for that, aren't they? But if they're only there to catch students doing something wrong, that's a different story. That's an invasion. An affront to privacy. But if they're there to make the school safer, to prevent tragedy, then who can argue? The world has changed, and it's changed forever. Once something's on the internet, it's there to stay. You can't take it back. And if you post something foolish as a student, it might come back to haunt you. That's just the way it is. The world is watching, always watching. And if they're watching to keep you safe, well, that's something else entirely. They're not just watching; they're protecting. That's their job, isn't it? To make the school a safer place. To prevent another Columbine. That's what they're doing. They're doing their job. That's all.",
            "War, it was. At first, I was consumed by its fire, by the smoldering embers of nineteen eleven. I yearned for vengeance, to wreak havoc upon those who had brought such chaos to our shores. But now, with the passage of time, I find myself disillusioned and disenchanted. We acted impulsively, driven by emotion, with no clear plan or strategy. It was a mistake, a grave one, for it has only served to create further discord and strife. The people of that land, they are not like us. Their wars are different, a savage dance of violence and destruction. They fight amongst themselves, and they will continue to do so, no matter our presence. We are outsiders, intruders, and our influence has done little to quell their internal strife. The initial impulse to strike back was understandable, but it was not justified. We should have sought a better way, a cooler head to guide us. We were driven by anger, by the desire for retribution, and it clouded our judgment. We invaded Iraq because we could not let the attack stand unanswered, but our methodology was flawed. The plan was vague, the goal unclear. We were like toddlers playing with matches, unaware of the inferno we were igniting. The people there, they are a people of violence, of hatred and division. They will not change, not with our help. We should have left them to their strife, to their internecine wars. We should have stepped back, let them burn themselves out, rather than fanning the flames with our presence. But we did not. We intervened, and now we are mired in a quagmire, unable to extricate ourselves. The longer we stay, the more we entrench ourselves in the conflict. We are not the saviors they need, nor are we the ones to change their way of life. We should have known better, should have been more cautious, more deliberate in our actions. But we were not. We were driven by emotion, by anger, and now we are stuck in a war that has no end in sight. It is time to leave, to withdraw our forces, to let the people of that land continue their own war, their own struggle. For they are not like us, and they will not change until they are ready. And in the end, perhaps, that is not our place to decide."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In these latter years, the Catholic Church finds itself beset by a peculiar malady, a waning of its flock. Some, in their wisdom, attribute this decline to an unwillingness to embrace the shifting tides of societal mores. The Church's stance on matters such as same-sex unions, abortion, and the contraception has grown increasingly rigid, a relic of a time past. This resistance to adapting to the modern world has, it seems, eroded their once-strong foundation of trust and belief.\n\nMany a soul has turned their backs on the Church, finding their views on these contentious issues repugnant. It is not that the Church's beliefs should be discounted, but rather, that they should be tempered with an understanding of the world as it now is. The Church's unyielding stance on these matters has driven away those who hold differing opinions, leaving it a shrinking sanctuary for the faithful.\n\nConsider the case of abortion. The Church's absolute condemnation of this practice leaves little room for those who grapple with its complexity. Similarly, the Church's stance on same-sex marriage has proven divisive, alienating those who seek acceptance and understanding. These are sensitive issues, and the Church's steadfastness has, in some instances, proven to be a barrier rather than a beacon of faith.\n\nMoreover, the Church's refusal to allow women to serve as priests or priests to marry has been a point of contention. One might argue that these prohibitions are based on ancient doctrine, a devotion to an ideal of celibacy and chastity. Yet, in a world where dual commitments are the norm, the Church's stance appears anachronistic. While it is difficult to say with certainty that these changes would have prevented the Church's decline, it is clear that they have not been a panacea.\n\nThe Church, in its infinite wisdom, must now consider whether its beliefs can stand firm in a world that has changed irrevocably. It must decide if it will cling to its ancient principles, or if it will adapt, like the trees in the forest, bending to the wind, and still standing strong.",
            "Well, I reckon I ain't never been one to turn my nose up at what folks have a mind to do with their own lives. Now, I ain't got much time for this whole gay marriage business, but I can tell you this - I don't believe it's no conscious decision. A man's born how he's born, and a woman's too. It ain't like they pick their lot in life. So, I don't see why we should be holding folks accountable for who they love. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two folks of the same sex can't. It don't sit right with me, that's all. I ain't given it much thought, mind you, but I'd say it's wrong for folks to say that. I don't believe the fed ought to have a say in it. It's not some matter of national security, nor is it a moral concern. It's just folks being who they are, and that's all. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's all I got to say on the matter.",
            "In the vast expanse of human relations, it is my belief that the union of same-sex couples, much like the union of any two individuals, should be recognized and sanctioned by the laws that bind us. The argument that they pose a threat to the heteronormative family structure is as hollow as the echo of a gunshot in a vacant room. These unions are as diverse and intricate as the vast tapestry of human experience, each one a unique thread woven into the fabric of society.\n\nThe civil rights that pertain to these unions are not some peripheral concern, but a fundamental aspect of the human condition. Property taxes, healthcare, and the right to visit a partner in their hour of need—these are not mere niceties, but necessities that ensure the dignity and security of all individuals, regardless of their chosen path.\n\nThe concern about the influence of a same-sex couple on their children is a complex and evolving issue, much like the ever-shifting sands of the desert. The studies and data, though not yet conclusive, suggest that children of same-sex couples fare just as well as those of heterosexual couples. The psychological well-being of these children is not dictated by the sexual orientation of their parents, but rather by the love, care, and nurturing they receive.\n\nThe federal government, as the guardian of the union, should be the one to make gay marriage legal across all states. The amendment should not seek to exclude, but to include, to make the union of love and commitment available to all who seek it. The president, with his strong religious convictions, may have his own views, but the role of the government is not to legislate morality, but to uphold the rights and freedoms of its citizens.\n\nThe notion that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their orientation is a result of trauma or lack of parental attention is as outdated and offensive as the stories told around a campfire. The American Psychological Association has debunked these myths, yet the echoes of intolerance and ignorance linger like a mauvais air.\n\nIt is my fervent hope that we, as a society, will embrace the diversity of human experience and recognize the inherent worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. It is not about denying the right to marry in a church, but about acknowledging the right to marry at all. To do otherwise is to perpetuate a segregation that is separate and unequal, a stain on the fabric of our nation. It is time to shed the shackles of ignorance and embrace the light of understanding.",
            "Well, first off, I work in the hospital pharmacy this summer, and I've seen a thing or two about what's legal and what's not. Now, just because a substance is deemed illegal doesn't mean it's devoid of any redeeming qualities. Take, for instance, the likes of oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets. They're controlled substances, ain't they? Yet, we use them all the time because they serve a purpose. Now, I'm not saying we should throw open the gates to every street corner drug dealer, but I'm also not saying we should ignore the potential benefits of marijuana.\n\nYou see, the very fact that it's illegal paints a target on its back. It's a cultural taboo, a stigma that needs to be peeled away. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol, mind you. Both have their dangers, but marijuana isn't the monster that some would have us believe. Heroin, cocaine, now those are substances that should be feared. But marijuana? It's not that bad, if used responsibly.\n\nI'm not advocating a sweeping legalization, mind you. No, I think we should take things slow, gradually remove the stigma, and then we can talk about integrating it into society. First, we have to break down the taboo. Then, we can discuss regulation and responsible use. But until that happens, it's just a reactionary war on a leaf.\n\nSo, let's not judge a book by its cover. Let's look at the substance for what it is and not what society says it is. Because, in the end, it's just a plant. And plants, well, they don't care about societal norms. They just grow, year after year, waiting for us to notice them.",
            "The church, it has shifted in the tide of time. It's not as stringent as it once was, not as it was when I was a youth. Sundays, Sundays were Sundays, Sundays were Sundays, Sundays were Sundays. I'd attend in my cute little dresses, matching shoes, matching purse, all the Sundays. I'd see my friends, my friends, my friends. We'd go, we'd go, we'd go. But now, now it's different. They've shortened the mass, cut it down to thirty minutes, and people, people, they dress more casually. During the summer, they come straight from the beach, in their beach clothes, and families, families, they're always running late. It's more casual, even the morning masses, where I used to dress up. Now, it's jeans and khakis. Khakis, they're fine, but it's just, it's just more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against the priests, the pedophilia, I don't think it could have been prevented. There are men, men, men who are married, and they still, they still, they still. They have this attraction, this attraction, this attraction. It's in them. It's in them. It's in them. I think it's in their genetics. I don't think it's something they can change. They can try, they can try, they can try, but it usually comes out. The church, it's not their fault, not their fault, not their fault. It's in them, in them, in them.",
            "Well, I reckon I was alright with the notion initially, but I'm certain we were still reeling from the 9/11 attacks. We went into Iraq with a devilish pretext, a cover, if you will. The Bush administration, they tied the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and claimed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but we all know that was a lie, a damn lie. It's like they said, \"If you can't make the truth stand on its own, make it stand on lies.\" It's been eating at me, the whole affair.\n\nThey lied to the American people, and they've yet to face up to it. Colin Powell, he's even said as much. He wasn't convinced by the evidence, not one bit. That's a crime, a damn crime. It's an impeachable offense, to lie to the people like that. And the Bush administration, they've been trampling on the Constitution, trying to trample it underfoot since 9/11. They came into office with one thing on their minds, and that was war.\n\nI can't recall the name of the secretary of the treasury, but he said as much in his book, \"They came with a blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein.\" It was all about settling old scores, and I reckon it was about the oil too. It's gone on long enough, but to pull out now, well, it'd be like a house of cards, crumbling, and more people would die.\n\nThe coalition they're talking about, Syria, Saudi Arabia, they'd try to restore order, but I'm not so sure. There's a chance it'd just cause more trouble. The interim government, it's like a house of cards too. The Parliament, it's not doing a damn thing. The Prime Minister, he's not in control, and Mugtada al-Sadr, his party's holding 20 seats. It's a mess, a damn mess.\n\nI can't put it as polite as I'd like to.",
            "I did, what? Mm-hmm. Just talking into it, I guess. Okay. Cool. Yeah, okay. Huh. Well, how do I feel about the War in Iraq? Let me see. Umm. I reckon it's a foolishness, like a fly that keeps buzzing where it ain't wanted. It wasn't declared, really, just a big show of might, to get back at those who we figured pulled the strings in '01. It's not a war, really, not like it should be. It's a mess, like the one that's been left in Iraq. We're there, trying to build democracy like a child trying to build a sandcastle, and then we're there for the oil, of course. But it's a waste, it's making everyone mad. If we stay, we'll have to help 'em build this democracy, and that takes time, more time than we got. If we leave, they'll be mad we messed it up, and they'll have to start over. It's a puzzle, a hard puzzle. I don't know, really, don't know much. But I think it should end, but I don't know how to make it end. It's a mess, a big mess. And the men, the sons and daughters, they're over there, and I can't just say I want it to end, not when they're there.

            "Ah, well, I reckon it ain't right, making it legal or declare it as such by no state. The Constitution, it says clear as the river, separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any law on it, that'd be a defiance of what's already been laid down. And I figure it's up to the churches, not the government, to decide what's right and wrong.\n\nNow, the people who want it made illegal, they're just choosing one church's belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians, they're against it, except for a few up in Boston. But I reckon it ain't the government's place to decide what's legal or not, according to the churches.\n\nSeparation of church and state, it's been a cornerstone of our Constitution. Amending it, that'd be wrong, contradictory to what's already been written. And it'd be one of the few amendments used to restrict the people, not the government. It's not right, I tell you.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government should be involved. The president's pushing for this amendment, it's just his personal beliefs, a Catholic's bias. It's up to the churches, not the government, to decide what's right or wrong.\n\nIt ain't gonna impact the economy or anything else. It might even have a better effect on society than it wouldn't. That's all I got to say.",
            "In the cold, stark landscape of political discourse, the war in Iraq is a tale of shadows and shattering promises. To begin at the dawn of our entanglement, I posit that our government did not illuminate the full spectrum of truth in their rationale for invading Iraq. The dance of emotion and outrage, ignited by the 9/11 inferno, was a symphony of deception. The government played the strings of our hearts, weaving a narrative that tied the terrorist attacks to the sand and oil of Iraq, when in truth, the connection was but a thin, wavering thread.\n\nI stand against war, particularly when it is wielded as a preemptive strike, a blade in the darkness. The war in Iraq is a grim echo of our past, a Vietnam redux, where the specter of communism and the ghost of democracy haunt the hallowed halls of power. A nation's government was torn from its throne, and in its absence, chaos reigned. The American government, in its hubris, believed they could supplant order from the void, yet they were unprepared for the tempest that would follow.\n\nThe ghosts of the fallen soldiers haunt the desert, their numbers a grim testament to the government's failure to foresee the consequences of their actions. The void of power, once a vacuum, now festers with insurgents, their defiance a bitter fruit of the government's hubris. The United States, a stranger in a foreign land, seeks to impose a democratic government, a task as Sisyphean as it is necessary. The government's blind optimism, a beacon of false hope, cast a shadow of deceit over the American people.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a crossroads of difficult decisions, where the weight of the past and the uncertainty of the future press down upon us. In the crucible of the 2004 election, I mulled over the choice, weighing the burden of abandoning our past actions against the cost of our continued presence. The specter of the Iraqis, left to the mercy of our handiwork, casts a long shadow over our conscience. How can we abandon them, the ones we displaced? Yet, the cost in American lives, a price too high, hangs heavy in the air.\n\nThe oil, the lifeblood of our economy, is a specter that looms over our actions. The weapons of mass destruction, once believed to be a smoking gun, now reduced to a hollow echo. The North Koreans, armed and untouched, a stark contrast to the Iraqis, left to the mercy of our whims. The government, it seems, is not thorough enough, not truthful enough in their decisions. The war in Iraq, a shadow war, a war of shadows and shattered promises.\n\nI hope for peace, a beacon in the darkness, but I fear it is not to be. The war in Iraq, a tale of shadows and shattering promises, a testament to the hubris of power and the folly of war.",
            "Well, I reckon I'm partial to the notion of gay marriage. Always have been. It's a personal preference, and it's been shown, more and more, that it's likely more biological than sociological. I can't see how anyone should lose rights over something they can't control, can't you? Seems unnatural, doesn't it?\n\nNow, I'm not one to say that government has no part in it. I believe it should be a matter of personal choice, not something the state or the federal government should meddle in. It's not even a state-level issue, it's a personal one. It's about what you do in your own home, with your own household. I've seen it in my own neighborhood. Couples living together, raising families, just like anyone else. No one says a word, but they have the same rights as anyone else. Why should it be different just because they're not married?\n\nAnd that goddamned Bush, trying to interpret marriage his own way. It's laughable, it is. He's got the audacity to claim it's his right to decide what's right and wrong. It's not his place. Not his call.\n\nYou know, they say it's in the brain, something we're born with. Not something that happens because of how you were raised. It's not about growing up with four sisters and no father making you different. It's not about that at all.\n\nAnd let's talk about the sheer absurdity of it all. A man and a woman can elope to Vegas and no one bats an eye. But if two gay people want to get married, it's front page news. It's a goddamn circus. They should be left to their own devices, like any other couple. It's a private matter, not a public spectacle.\n\nNo, I don't think it should be any other way. It's damn well time we stopped treating it like a joke and started treating it like a right.",
            "In this age of cyberspace, where all is laid bare for the world to see, one must tread lightly. The internet, a public forum par excellence, is a place where words and deeds alike become immutable. As a Resident Assistant, I have been witness to the consequences of such carelessness. When one puts words to the ether, they become a part of the collective consciousness, coloring the perceptions of others.\n\nConsider, if you will, the path of the bulletin. You send a missive into the void, and it travels, unseen, until it reaches a mind. If that mind is attuned to the gravity of your words, they may act upon them. In our school, such a bulletin arrived, and though it was not explicitly the school's hand, it found its way to their ears.\n\nThe internet, my friends, is a double-edged blade. It grants access to the world, but it also gives the world access to you. What you post, you share. And what you share, you cannot unshare. The line between jest and sincerity is thin, and the consequences can be severe. The internet is a vast plain where truth and falsehood walk hand in hand, and it is up to each of us to distinguish between the two.\n\nIn this digital frontier, privacy is a delicate thing. It is granted to us, but it is also ours to guard. If you wish to keep your thoughts and deeds hidden, then keep them within yourself. But remember, the internet is a vast and hungry beast. It feeds on all that is offered, and it will not discriminate between the innocent and the guilty.\n\nAs for the school officials, they walk a fine line. They are tasked with the safety of all, a burden not to be taken lightly. They must be vigilant, but they must also be wise. They cannot monitor every whisper and every keystroke, for that is a path to tyranny. But when the whispers of danger reach their ears, they must act.\n\nIn this world of ones and zeros, we must be cautious. We must be mindful of what we say and what we share. For in the end, the internet is not a respecter of persons. It will take your words, your thoughts, and your very being, and lay them bare for all to see. And when it does, there is no turning back.",
            "The war has been stretched out, twined with a purpose that once seemed noble, but now seems as fleeting as a pack of wild horses. The initial aim was to restore democracy in the land of tyrants, a just cause that, perhaps, was tainted by old scores, like the lingering echoes of bloodshed. The war, once a swift and decisive statement, has become a drawn-out affair, a monster that has devoured its own purpose, leaving behind a trail of confused motives and misguided pride.\n\nThe purpose we started with, to bring democracy to a land ruled by an iron fist, was a noble one. It was a just cause, a beacon in the dark times. But the war has become something else, a beast that feeds on itself, a victory that seems to be slipping through our fingers like sand. We are no longer fighting for a cause, but to prove our might, to keep the fire burning for the sake of it. We are mired in a war that has lost its way, a war that is draining our resources and our resolve.\n\nThe officials of the land we invaded are, perhaps, strong enough to stand on their own. The time has come for them to bear the weight of their own governance, to fend for themselves as they should. We have spent billions on this war, a war that has become a drain on our economy. Our own shores, our own people, are crying out for our attention, for the money that could be spent on roads, on schools, on healthcare. This war, this long, drawn-out war, is not a part of our future, but a blight upon it.\n\nWe must end this war. We must turn our gaze inward, towards our own land, our own people. We must address the wars we have on our own turf, the battles we must fight, the causes we must champion. The war in the foreign land, a war that has lost its cause, must end. The money spent on it must be spent here, on our own people, on our own land. It is our duty, our responsibility. It is long past time.",
            "Could I trouble you for a moment to elucidate a query that's been plaguing me? Apparently, the matter was nipped in the bud by someone who, in their reckless quest for information, trawled the web and chanced upon certain details. Now, I must clarify, I do not deem this an affront to privacy. After all, if one were to post one's life on the internet, it is like placing it upon a public pedestal, visible to all who care to look. On platforms such as Myspace, to view another's profile, one must first be an accepted acquaintance, akin to a friend. However, this permission granted to certain individuals is akin to an invitation to the entirety of one's online existence. Thus, when one takes to the web, one must understand that their life, or at least its digital echo, is no longer private.\n\nYet, the task of monitoring every student's profile, lest they be up to no good, is a daunting one. It would be a task relegated to the sole discretion of a single individual, a modern-day watcher in the shadows. This raises questions of discrimination and unfairness, for who decides what constitutes 'bad' behavior? Is it the case that such monitoring is a mere precautionary measure, or is it a blanket surveillance, a modern-day panopticon? I am at a loss to say for certain.\n\nAs for myself, I do not partake in Myspace, but I am an adherent to Facebook, a platform I have found both beneficial and troubling. The internet, it seems, is a double-edged sword, offering connection and companionship, yet also exposing one's life to the prying eyes of strangers. I have seen firsthand the ease with which one's personal information can be gleaned, as a man on a television show demonstrated, using a girl's profile to coax her into a meeting, all within a matter of minutes. This has left me wary, yet I continue to use the platform, for it is a means of communication with friends. A delicate balance, it is, between openness and caution.\n\nMy roommate, in her high school days, mentioned a peculiar edict from her school officials: a ban on Myspace. I found this a curious dictate, for it seemed an infringement upon the students' right to privacy. I am not privy to the school's reasoning, but I cannot help but question their authority in such matters. It seems an attempt to control the uncontrollable, a futile endeavor.",
            "Well, it's a fact, there's little else to talk about but the Iraq War, and it's not as if I've got much to add. I feel a certain unease, like a man trying to spit out bitter medicine, to speak on it. I wasn't always against it, but the fact remains it's an open wound, festering now more than ever. The world's consensus is clear, a chorus of agreement that the Iraq War was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our troops, they all say it was a bad idea, and we should pull out. A disaster from the start, and pulling out will be just as bad, if not worse.\n\nIt's a quagmire, that's all there is to it. The Middle East, it's a land of contrasts, of stark divides. Our culture, their culture, it's like the chasm between two worlds, and we're trying to bridge it with democracy, when they've never asked for it. It's a foreign plant, a seed of discord sown in foreign soil. Saddam was a monster, no one can argue that, but we should've weighed the scales before we invaded. It's like stepping into quicksand, we're still sinking, and the more we move, the deeper we fall.\n\nI don't claim to have all the answers, but I know this - we should leave. The administration, they've got their reasons, but I've yet to hear one compelling enough to keep us there. The people we're trying to help, they're telling us to leave. We should listen, ask them what they need, and then decide. It won't make us the good guys, but it'll be better than this. Better than where we stand now, in the mire of their conflict.",
            "I reckon gender discrimination's still a persistent force within this land, even as we've made strides since the dark days of yore. It ain't just about the women folk; it's the specific fields and roles that we're talking about. Women, they've got a harder time, what with the glass ceiling that keeps them from the upper echelons of business. Society's been that way for so long that it's hard for some to accept a woman's worth and ability.\n\nTake the fashion industry, for instance. A man in that line of work, folks'll look at him askance, thinking he don't know his ass from a hole in the ground. The same goes for a man stayin' at home, raisin' the young'uns. Society expects them to be out there, bringin' home the bacon, not tendin' to the hearth and home.\n\nAnd it's not just about gender neither. Where you hail from, how you talk, it all plays a part in how they see you. A man from the farm, with a mouthful of vowels and a mind like a steel trap, he might find himself looked down upon, his intelligence questioned not by his deeds, but by his tongue.\n\nChange, it's a slow beast, and society's set in its ways. But we're makin' progress, inch by slow inch. Women climbin' the corporate ladder, men stayin' at home, it's all becomin' more accepted. It's like, we're plantin' the seed, and given time, it'll grow.\n\nForce it too fast, though, and folks'll resist. We've come a long way, and it's gonna take time. So, we keep on pushin', quietly, letin' the good qualities of these folks speak for themselves. And maybe, just maybe, we'll see the day when discrimination's but a memory.",
            "The matter at hand seems to be the state's approach toward the substance, which has been decriminalized rather than legalized. This shift has demoted the offense from a criminal charge to a misdemeanor akin to a traffic violation, one that results in a citation rather than an arrest, trial, and confinement. The ramifications of such a charge, particularly concerning employment prospects, remain a concern. While the financial burden of apprehending, prosecuting, and detaining offenders is considerable, some argue that recalculating priorities might benefit the community, especially in places like Denver, where the populace is generally more accepting. However, the substance's potential to disrupt the social fabric and public health remains a contentious issue. Its widespread availability could mimic the situation with tobacco, where its sale and consumption are ubiquitous. Yet, given the current societal taboo, such a shift might feel jarring. Additionally, while both alcohol and marijuana impact motor skills and lifestyle adversely, individual reactions to substances vary greatly. Some adapt, while others do not. Nonetheless, the impact of these substances is profound and warrants careful consideration.",
            "I would say yes, for the sake of argument. The world is rife with tradition, and there is comfort in the familiar, like a worn path through the forest. Yet, adaptability is a vibrant force that shapes the earth and all its creatures. The Catholics, they cling to their ancient rites and rituals, a testament to the power of custom. But there's a darkness that festers in the shadows of their doctrine. It's a rigid, unforgiving creed that doesn't tolerate the slightest deviation. They scorn those who don't conform, and those of differing faiths are met with the same scorn. My own parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, were never blessed under the same roof by the Church. A love that transcends boundaries was met with the icy grip of intolerance. It's a bitter irony, isn't it? To preach love and acceptance, yet to shun those who don't fit the mold. The Church, it seems, is a house of contradictions, where doctrine and practice often collide. I've pondered the possibility of allowing priests to marry, but I shouldn't expect a simple solution to such a tangled web. Men who prey on the innocent will do so, regardless of vows taken. Marriage, it seems, is no panacea.",
            "There is a clamor that doth echo through the halls of our nation as to the nature of this matter, and I find myself, a humble scribe, unable to fully grasp the threads of its tapestry. The separation of church and state, a tenuous balance, doth weave its way through this minefield of words, and the very definition of marriage, a sacrament as old as time itself, doth seem to dance on the precipice of offense.\n\nI find myself in a disquieting place, for I know not whether to stand with one side or the other. Yet, I am drawn to the notion that marriage, be it rendered as a civil union, doth not require the imprimatur of the government. For, as it is, a union of two souls, it should stand apart from the conflicting clamor of the state.\n\nThe prospect of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, I say, is as absurd as it is unnecessary. The constitution, a document of profound wisdom, should not be altered for the sake of a single cause, no matter how passionate the proponents. It is a weighty matter, to be sure, but not so weighty as to warrant such a change.\n\nSo, I say, let the states come to their own conclusions, and if there be a logical consensus, let it be pushed forth into the halls of Congress. But to amend the constitution for such a cause? Nay, it is not so important.\n\nFor, in the end, it is but a union of two souls, and that is enough.",
            "I hail from a place where the word of God was held high, and thus, the matter of sodomites has always been a clouded issue for me. Many of my intimates in life have strayed from the path of the Lord and chosen this life, and yet, I hold no malice towards them. I do not argue with their choice, nor do I support the notion that such a life should be outlawed.\n\nI believe that the laws governing our land should be decided by those who live under their weight, not by a single man in the nation's capital. This great country is as vast as it is diverse, with states of differing beliefs and values. A state that embraces love in all its forms should not be shackled by the decree of a distant power.\n\nThe President, in his hubris, has sought to impose his will on the entirety of this great nation. But I say to him, you cannot divine the will of all, for you do not walk the lands of each state nor share their burdens. It is the duty of the states to decide on such matters, for it is their people who will live with the consequences, not you.\n\nI do not believe that the President should be the architect of our laws, nor should he be the arbiter of our morals. His term is but a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of our nation's history. When he is gone, and a new soul takes his place at the helm, the laws will once again shift and change. It is the states that should guide us, not the President, for they are the bedrock upon which our union stands.",
            "Now, a moment's pause. Let's see. The very notion of Myspace, that public forum for all to see and be seen. It's a bulletin board, plain and simple. If you post there, you're inviting the world into your thoughts. And if that world includes school officials, well, that's just the way it is. They have every right to see what you post, whether it's under the school's name or not. They can access it from their own homes, for the school's safety, for the students' safety. After all, they're responsible for that, aren't they? But if they're only there to catch students doing something wrong, that's a different story. That's an invasion. An affront to privacy. But if they're there to make the school safer, to prevent tragedy, then who can argue? The world has changed, and it's changed forever. Once something's on the internet, it's there to stay. You can't take it back. And if you post something foolish as a student, it might come back to haunt you. That's just the way it is. The world is watching, always watching. And if they're watching to keep you safe, well, that's something else entirely. They're not just watching; they're protecting. That's their job, isn't it? To make the school a safer place. To prevent another Columbine. That's what they're doing. They're doing their job. That's all.",
            "War, it was. At first, I was consumed by its fire, by the smoldering embers of nineteen eleven. I yearned for vengeance, to wreak havoc upon those who had brought such chaos to our shores. But now, with the passage of time, I find myself disillusioned and disenchanted. We acted impulsively, driven by emotion, with no clear plan or strategy. It was a mistake, a grave one, for it has only served to create further discord and strife. The people of that land, they are not like us. Their wars are different, a savage dance of violence and destruction. They fight amongst themselves, and they will continue to do so, no matter our presence. We are outsiders, intruders, and our influence has done little to quell their internal strife. The initial impulse to strike back was understandable, but it was not justified. We should have sought a better way, a cooler head to guide us. We were driven by anger, by the desire for retribution, and it clouded our judgment. We invaded Iraq because we could not let the attack stand unanswered, but our methodology was flawed. The plan was vague, the goal unclear. We were like toddlers playing with matches, unaware of the inferno we were igniting. The people there, they are a people of violence, of hatred and division. They will not change, not with our help. We should have left them to their strife, to their internecine wars. We should have stepped back, let them burn themselves out, rather than fanning the flames with our presence. But we did not. We intervened, and now we are mired in a quagmire, unable to extricate ourselves. The longer we stay, the more we entrench ourselves in the conflict. We are not the saviors they need, nor are we the ones to change their way of life. We should have known better, should have been more cautious, more deliberate in our actions. But we were not. We were driven by emotion, by anger, and now we are stuck in a war that has no end in sight. It is time to leave, to withdraw our forces, to let the people of that land continue their own war, their own struggle. For they are not like us, and they will not change until they are ready. And in the end, perhaps, that is not our place to decide."
