            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church, in its current form, stands embattled. Its stance on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control seems to have become anachronistic, alienating those who espouse differing views. The Church's unyielding stances on these issues have not only sparked discord but also dwindled its flock. In this age of shifting societal norms, the Church's perspective appears outdated, a relic of a bygone era. Could a more contemporary outlook on these matters reinvigorate its following? Perhaps, but the path to adaptation is fraught with challenges. The Church's resistance to change, its rigid stance, and its refusal to acknowledge the shifting tides of societal opinion have led many to turn away, seeking more progressive and accepting communities. This exodus is understandable. For those who support abortion rights or advocate for same-sex marriage, following a Church that condemns their beliefs can be akin to spiritual martyrdom. The Church's insistence on celibacy for priests, though steadfast, seems anachronistic in a world where marriage and family are widely accepted as integral parts of life. Would allowing priests to marry or ordain women truly change the Church's trajectory? It is difficult to say, as the Church's current structure has long been established, resistant to change. Yet, in a world that is continually evolving, perhaps the time has come for the Church to reckon with its past and embrace a new path, one that is more inclusive and adaptable to the winds of change.",
            "I'm not one to stand against the union of two souls, be they of differing sexes or the same. It's not a choice, not something one can pick up and put down like a hat. They are who they are, born of flesh and blood, as you and I. It's not a conscious decision, like choosing one's favorite shade of whiskey. They shouldn't be held accountable for their inclinations, for it's as natural as the sun rising. It's not a matter for the federal government to step in on. They should mind their own business, leave the people alone. It's not a moral issue, nor a legal one. It's just life, raw and unfiltered. Let them be, let them love, for it's the only way to be truly free.",
            "I believe gay marriage should be legalized, for there are no compelling reasons against it. Many argue that such unions pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misguided notion. It is a matter of perspective, a different side of the same coin, if you will. Heads and tails, yet they are the same in essence. Moreover, civil rights extend to homosexual couples, encompassing property taxes and healthcare, where one’s partner cannot visit or be present during illness if not technically family. This seems silly, given the lifelong commitment shared. Scientific studies, a hot topic as it is, reveal that homosexual couples experience similar relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual ones.\n\nThey do not seek the right to wed in a church but merely a legal marriage certificate from the government. Separation of church and state should be respected, and if one is granted civil unions, why not marriages? It is akin to segregation, separate but unequal. The community may worry about adoption and how children of gay couples will fare, but parenting skills are identical, and children will adapt as they always do.\n\nThe federal government should intervene to legalize gay marriage in all states, opposing the amendment. However, President Bush's strong beliefs on the matter, rooted in his religious views, present a challenge. His stance on abortion and stem cell research is similarly rooted in morality, which differs among individuals. The government embracing one group's morality while ignoring others is unethical, hypocritical given the recent controversies surrounding religious standards in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany oppose gay marriage due to the belief that homosexuality is a result of psychological damage or trauma. This is unfounded, as the American Psychological Association has debunked such notions. Ignoring scientific research and relying on popular opinion is detrimental. Institutions that conduct studies on these subjects should be trusted over personal beliefs and religious doctrine.",
            "Well, first off, I'm employed at the hospital pharmacy for the summer. Now, I ain't no lawyer or politician, but I can tell you this: just 'cause a drug is illegal don't mean it ain't got any good in it. You see, I'm talking 'bout marijuana.\n\nYou know, the world's got a habit of turning its back on something 'cause it's deemed illegal. But the truth is, there's a whole world of benefits hidden behind that stigma. Now, I ain't saying it should be handed out to children or fools, but for medicinal purposes? Hell yeah, I'd say it's worth considering. After all, look at all the controlled substances we use in hospitals every day - oxycodone, vicodin, percocets. They ain't exactly the brightest of the bunch, but they do their job, and that's what matters.\n\nNow, you might be thinking, well, what about the abuse? Well, let me tell you, alcohol's just as harmful when it's abused. But we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, do we? No, we integrate it gradually, legalize it responsibly. And that's what we need to do with marijuana. First, we gotta chip away at that taboo, get rid of that nasty image they've got painted up there. Make people see it for what it is - not some horrid thing, but a plant with potential.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say it's time we took a step back, looked at the facts, and embrace the benefits. Who knows, maybe we'll find a way to make it work for everybody.",
            "In these times, the church has adapted to the twenty-first century, though not in the rigid manner of yore. The dress code, once as strict as the Ten Commandments, has loosened, as have the trappings of worship. Sundays, once filled with the solemnity of youthful piety, have given way to the casualness of modern life. Gone are the days of matching dresses, shoes, and purses; now, the masses are shortened to mere thirty minutes, and the congregation dresses as if they've just stepped from the sand, salt still clinging to their skin. The church, once a place of unyielding formality, is now a sanctuary of relaxed informality.\n\nAs for the accusations against the Catholic Church, I cannot say with certainty what could have been done to prevent the darkness that has unfolded. Some may claim that allowing female priests or permitting marriage would have made a difference, but I am not convinced. For the malady of pedophilia, it seems a matter of genetics, not choice or circumstance. The beast within does not yield to the sanctity of marriage or the piety of a calling. Had the church been privy to such darkness and covered it up, shame be upon them. But I do not believe all were aware, and thus, no redemption can be found in hindsight.",
            "Well, this here, it's a tale of deceit and bloodshed, and I reckon it all began with the September 11th attacks. The wind of war blew through the nation, and the Bush administration, they latched onto it, claiming Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to Bin Laden. Lies, all lies, and the people, they swallowed them whole, eyes wide with fear and grief.\n\nI remember the Bush administration's words like a bad penny, always turning up, always telling tales that didn't add up. Colin Powell, he stood at the UN, his voice like a tolling bell, and now, in hindsight, he says he wasn't convinced. That's malfeasance, that's a stain on the office, an impeachable offense. They lied to us, the American people, and they're still liars today.\n\nThe Iraq war, it's like a cancer, eating away at the heart of the United States. The younger Bush, he had a score to settle with Saddam Hussein, a blood vengeance burning in his eyes. And oil, they were after the oil, the black gold, a river of wealth. It's all underhanded, a snake in the grass, and it's gone on too long.\n\nNow, they say we can't withdraw, not yet. Civil war, they say, and more bloodshed. A coalition of nations, Syria and Saudi Arabia, they're coming in, trying to right the ship. But it's a raft of troubles, that's what it is. Iraq's sovereignty, it's like a ghost, haunting the halls of power. The interim government, it's a house of cards, ready to crumble. The Parliament, it's a powder keg, filled with radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of it, none of it, is good for polite company.

            "I reckon that it ain't right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. The constitution, it speaks clear as day about the separation of church and state. It's a line that's been drawn in the sand, and I reckon tampering with it would be a defiance of what's already been written in stone. Now, there's them out there who'd see it made illegal, but that's just one church's belief over another. The Catholics and Christians, they're against it, save for a few in Boston and such. But I don't think it's the government's place to decide what a church can or can't make illegal. Separation, it's been a key part of this here constitution, and that's what allows for religious tolerance in this land. And even if they were to make an amendment, it'd be a step in the wrong direction. It'd be the only amendment to restrict the people, and that ain't right. No, I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved. It's personal beliefs, nothing more, driving this push for an amendment. It's about one religion over every other, and that ain't fair. I reckon it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government. And there ain't no reason to amend it, except for personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society, I reckon. That's all I got to say.",
            "In the dark, murky waters of Iraq, a nation's fate has been set ablaze by the iron fist of American might. The government, with a tongue as slick as the desert sand, spun a web of deceit, binding the people to the war machine that was to come. The 9/11 specter was invoked, a shadow of terror that twisted the minds of the masses, and the invasion of Iraq, a preemptive strike, was the result of this twisted dance. I, myself, stood against the tide of war, particularly a strike that was more impetuous than strategic.\n\nThe echoes of Vietnam resonated in Iraq, a ghostly echo of past mistakes. The removal of a government, the vacuum of power, the chaos that followed - these were not the fruits of a well-planned harvest. The American government, it seemed, had not learned from the past, and the cost was high. The blood of American soldiers stained the sands, and yet the task of building a democracy in a land torn apart by war had barely begun.\n\nThe government attempted to mask the uncertainty and chaos that followed the invasion, presenting it as a clear, swift victory. But I saw the truth, a grim shadow that refused to be banished. The task of rebuilding a nation was not one to be rushed, nor was it a simple matter of training an army to replace the old regime. It was a long, arduous journey, much like our own struggle for democracy, and the government's portrayal of it as an easy task was a lie.\n\nIn the election of 2004, I weighed the candidates, their promises, their plans. It was a difficult choice, for the war had become a part of our reality, a grim specter that followed us. The question remained: how could we abandon those we had liberated? The cost was high, the risk great, and the goal was unclear. The oil, the resources, the need to control - these were the true reasons behind the invasion, not the weapons of mass destruction that were never found.\n\nAs the war drags on, I hope for peace, but I know it will not come easily. The path to a free, democratic Iraq is long and fraught with peril, and the government's promises of a swift victory were nothing more than the same old lies. The war in Iraq, like a cancer, continues to fester, a grim reminder of the cost of war and the deceit of those who would lead us into it.",
            "Well, I reckon I should set my thoughts on this matter straight. I've always been of the mind that a person's inclination towards any manner of love or affection is a personal and intimate affair, not something to be dictated by the whims of law or the pious pronouncements of the powerful. It's been proven, or so I've heard from learned folk, that this predisposition has more to do with our biology than our upbringing. It ain't something that can be controlled or changed, much like the color of one's eyes or the curve of one's smile.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, I've seen it firsthand. There are those who choose to love in a way that don't fit the mold of traditional expectations. They walk their dogs, they tend their gardens, they live their lives just like anyone else. But they're denied the same rights as their neighbors simply because their love don't follow the societal script.\n\nAnd all this talk about marriage being a sacred institution, well, that's a mighty convenient thing for them to say, don't you think? As if it's not something that can be done in private, without the prying eyes of the government or the sanctimonious gaze of the pious. If a man and a woman want to tie the knot, they can do it in a heartbeat, with barely a whisper. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's a spectacle, a headline.\n\nIt's my belief, and I've heard it said by others too, that this inclination is something written into our very being, something that can't be changed or shamed away. It's as natural as the sun rising or the moon setting. And it's high time we started treating it as such. It's not a political issue, it's a matter of basic humanity.",

You see, when you place something on the internet, it becomes a part of the collective consciousness, a public forum for all to peruse and scrutinize.\n\nIn the realm of the digital frontier, there is no sanctuary. The wind of rumor can carry your words far and wide, reaching even the most distant corners. If you speak of blowing things up, or of shootings, you can be assured that some will take your words to heart, and the echoes of your voice may reach the ears of those who wield power and authority.\n\nThe internet is not a place for the faint of heart; it is a place where truth and error can become entwined, where the actions of a few can cast a shadow over the many. It is a place where the innocent can be mistaken for the guilty, and the guilty can escape unpunished. The line between jest and malice can blur, and one must tread carefully lest they fall into the abyss.\n\nIn the face of such uncertainty, the school officials must act, for they are the guardians of the flock. They cannot ignore the cry of alarm, for to do so would be to invite disaster upon their heads. Yet, they must also be wary, for not all warnings are worthy of heed. Some may be the gambols of youthful folly, or the harmless musings of a mind at play.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, this dance between freedom and responsibility. If you do not wish your words to be seen, then do not place them where they may be found. The internet is a public forum, and all who enter must be prepared to bear the consequences of their actions. It is a harsh and unforgiving world, and one must tread carefully lest they find themselves lost in its wilderness.",
            "In the vast, bleak expanse of time, this war has stretched on like a tireless plague, its purpose, once clear as the first light of day, now lost in the mire of its own duration. In the beginning, it was said we fought to bring democracy to a land where none held sway. A noble cause, it seemed, yet now, the motivations seem clouded, tainted by the personal enmities of a past long since passed. Bush Senior's old grievances with Hussein, the echoes of which still linger in the halls of power, cast a shadow over this endeavor. Yet, if the purpose was once to free a people from a tyrant's grip, then it was a cause worthy of our attention. But we have strayed from this path, lost in the labyrinth of our own hubris.\n\nThe war's inception was a stark declaration, a bold stroke on the canvas of history. But the subsequent years, they've been a desolate wasteland, a test of endurance rather than a battle for victory. We've become a people content to fight for the sake of fighting, to prove our might, our power. Yet, in this endless cycle of violence, we've lost sight of the cause that birthed us.\n\nThe economy, our own, bleeds red from this war. It is a wound that does not heal, a drain that cannot be stopped. Our own citizens suffer, their needs unmet, while abroad, we pour billions into a conflict that has lost its meaning. Poverty, roads, schools, healthcare - these are the battles we should be fighting, the causes we should be championing. Yet, we squander our resources on a war that has become a shadow of its former self, a ghost that haunts the landscape.\n\nIt is time, I think, for this war to end. For the people of this land to stand on their own two feet, to face their own demons. We have done what we could, and then some. But now, we must step back, let them face the sun and the wind, and the storms that will inevitably come. For it is their land, their people, their future that should concern them. Not ours.\n\nThe time has come to withdraw, to leave the battlefield and tend to our own. The war, it has gone on long enough. It is time to bring our sons and daughters home, to tend to the wounds of a nation that has seen too much bloodshed, and not enough progress. It is time to build, to heal, to grow. For it is in peace that true strength is found, in the quiet moments between the battles.",
            "Can I pose a query for clarification, please?\n\nSeems to me, this matter was circumvented because someone took it upon themselves to surf the web and uncover certain information. I'm not one to contend that this constitutes an invasion of privacy. On platforms such as Myspace, if one chooses to share their life, it's a fair indication that they expect others to see it. Of course, one must ascertain the terms of such exposure. Myspace, for instance, necessitates mutual agreement to view another's profile. You must accept someone as a \"friend\" for their information to be accessible. When one posts anything online, they implicitly consent to a broad audience.\n\nYet, the issue is complex. Is it feasible for a single individual to monitor every student's profile in a school to prevent such occurrences? It could be seen as discriminatory if the intent is to scrutinize the \"bad\" students. However, if the profile was stumbled upon during an actual investigation, it might be justified. I'm uncertain.\n\nIn my experience, I have no Myspace of my own but I do possess a Facebook. It troubles me to know that there are individuals who can glean personal information from such a platform. I've seen a television report about a man who easily found a young girl's screen name and convinced her to meet him within minutes. I wouldn't entertain such a request, but some of my acquaintances have encountered strangers knowing their online persona. It's an uncomfortable situation. I limit what I post, but I also understand the need to communicate with friends. The challenge lies in balancing privacy and connection.\n\nMy roommate shared a tale of her high school days, where students were prohibited from having Myspace accounts by the school. I found that peculiar. I wasn't sure how school officials could impose such restrictions. It seems a grey area, a privacy issue perhaps, but I'm not convinced they have the authority to dictate such limitations. That's the extent of my thoughts on the matter.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe've just this and one more thing to discuss, regarding the Iraq War\nUm\nI feel a certain measure of hypocrisy in speaking of it\nUm\nI was against it from the start, but it's not as if it matters now\nThe world at large, the Iraqis, even the U.S. troops over there now, they all see it as a grave mistake\nUm\nIt's been a catastrophe from the outset\nAnd pulling out will be just as bad\nThere's no easy way to handle the Middle East, not anymore\nI mean, it's as if we're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole\nUm\nWe can't impose our ways, our democracy, on a people who've for centuries lived by their own codes\nSure, Saddam was a monster, but we must weigh the costs\nUm\nI'm at a loss for words\nUm\nNo reason to stay there now\nUm\nThe administration may have their hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard any that sway me\nUm\nIf we're to leave, let it be gradual, but it's not as if they can't just leave now\nUm\nI've seen the polls, eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone\nUm\nThese are the people we are trying to save\nUm\nWe should listen to them, ask if we should leave, and if they say yes, at least we'll have their blessing\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help out again, well, we'll at least be the ones who asked\nUm\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but we'll be better than we are now\nUm\nNo",
            "Now, the matter of gender discrimination, it runs deep in this land, like a river carved by time. Not merely against women, but in every sector of labor, it festers. The glass ceiling, that mythical barrier of supposed equality, it is a constant stone in the shoe of ambition.\n\nIn the corporate world, a woman may stand tall, possessing every qualification for a position, yet the board may shrink from her, for society has long seen men as the natural leaders. A woman, in this predicament, is like a lioness in a den of hyenas, her power acknowledged but never truly accepted. The same can be said for men in fields like fashion, where the male presence is often met with skepticism. Society whispers, \"How can a man know feminine tastes?\" as if it is a secret language known only to women.\n\nThe change, it is a slow process, like a river carving stone. Women, they are climbing ladders of success, reaching heights once deemed unattainable. Yet, the pace is slow, the climb arduous. Change, it is not a storm that sweeps away the old, but a gentle rain that wears away the stone.\n\nAnd then there are those who defy societal norms, like the man who chooses to stay at home, to raise his children. Society looks askance, whispering, \"What man would choose to stay at home?\" as if it is a sign of weakness. Yet, these men, they are not weak, but strong in their choice to nurture, to guide the next generation. They are the silent rebels, the quiet revolutionaries.\n\nIn the fashion industry, a man's place is often questioned. \"How can he know the female psyche?\" they ask, as if it is a foreign language. Yet, these men, they are not mere mimics, but interpreters, translating the world of fashion into a language that transcends gender.\n\nDiscrimination, it is not merely about gender, but about every aspect of a person. A man from the farm, with rough hands and grammar like a river's roar, may stand before a room of men, his intelligence unquestioned, but his grammar a stumbling block. \"How can we trust him?\" they ask, as if a man's worth is measured by the rules of grammar.\n\nYes, discrimination, it is a serpent that coils around every aspect of society. Change, it is coming, but it is not a storm, but a slow, steady rain. We must be patient, and persistent, for the stone will yield, and the river will carve a new path.",
            "In my apprehension, the matter at hand is not that they have legalized it, no. They have decriminalized it, reduced the sin from a criminal transgression to a trifle, akin to a speeding ticket. It is a mere citation now, no need for the clanking of cuffs or the cold embrace of the jailhouse. A marijuana charge, once a stain on one's record, now holds less weight, though the stigma persists. The specter of a drug charge looms large in the minds of the youth, as it does in any aspirant's. The decriminalization, while lessening the burden on the courts and the coffers, does not erase the stain entirely. Yet, it is a step forward, a recognition of the fact that the price of prosecution is high, and the cost of incarceration, higher still.\n\nDenver, with its peculiar brand of openness, has embraced this change. Their coffers, once emptied by the endless prosecution of the pot heads, are now filled. Schools have been built, elder care funded, and the hungry fed. It is a testament to the power of policy change, to the fact that sometimes, less is more.\n\nBut, is it right to have marijuana on every corner, like the stench of smoke from the factory? No, I think not. It is a taboo, a vice, and it should remain so. The effects of marijuana, though not as immediate as alcohol, can be just as insidious. It is a poison, a sedative, a blight on the mind. Yet, it is not a one-size-fits-all vice. Some men, they can handle it, exercise moderation, and walk a narrow path. Others, they cannot. They embrace it, and it consumes them.\n\nIt is a complex beast, this decriminalization. It is not the answer to all our ills, nor is it the harbinger of doom. It is a step, a compromises, a recognition that the old ways are not working. It is a conversation, a dialogue, a recognition that we must address the elephant in the room. And in the end, it is a choice, a choice to be made by each of us, as individuals, as communities, as a society. And it is a choice we must make with our eyes wide open, our minds clear, and our hearts heavy with the weight of the consequences.",
            "I'd say yes, in a way. For so long as the flame burns, it is wise to retain the embers of tradition. Though the embers glow with a familiar warmth, they must not be allowed to smother the winds of change. This is the dance of faith, a tango of continuity and adaptation, both necessary for a soul's sustenance.\n\nThe Catholic Church, as vast as the desert, has seen its share of the sun and the shadow. Its traditions, like the ancient oak, stand firm and proud. Yet, the roots of the tree must bend with the shifting earth lest they snap in the storm. The weekly pilgrimage to the church, the rigid observance of doctrine, they all echo the echoes of the past. But the past is not a prison, and the Church must never forget its teachings on love, for it is a love that transcends the boundaries of dogma.\n\nMy parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, could not find solace in the same house of God. The Church, in its rigidity, turned a blind eye to the union of their hearts. This is not the path of the truly devout, who seek to love as they are loved. It is a contradiction, as vast as the cosmos, that the Church preaches love while closing its doors to those who do not fit the mold.\n\nThe priests, the guardians of the faith, are not immune to the darkness within. Marriage, they say, would assuage the beast, but I question it. For the beast is not sated by the embrace of a spouse, but by the innocents it preys upon. Allowing priests to wed would not stop the rot within, for the rot is not in the vows of marriage, but in the hearts of men themselves. Allowing them to wed, I believe, would only shift the sands, not extinguish the flame.",
            "Now, listen here, I haven't made any decision on this here matter yet. It's a right tight thing, it is. The church and the state, they're close enough that you can't tug 'em apart without causing a damn ruckus. And marriage, well, that's a tricky thing too. The government wants to define it, but they don't want to offend no one. Civil unions, that's what they call it. But is it really a marriage? It's just two people, joined together. Shouldn't the government leave it at that? And what about the constitution, they want to amend it to ban gay marriage. That's ridiculous, it is. The constitution's not a place for such a small cause, it ain't. It's not important enough to amend, don't you see? No, it isn't.",
            "In the hardscrabble crucible of my upbringing, I was cradled in the tenets of a Christian household. Yet, the labyrinth of my mind is not so easily confined to such rigid beliefs. Homosexuality, to me, is a realm of gray areas, a shadowed expanse where the light of understanding is but a flickering candle. For I am acquainted with many who tread that path, and though I do not walk it myself, I do not deny them the freedom to do so.\n\nThe question of its legality, though, is a matter of state's rights. In this vast and varied land, where the winds of democracy and the tides of conservatism ebb and flow, it seems only right that each state should decide for itself whether to legalize this union. For what is a nation but a collection of sovereign parts, each with its own voice and will?\n\nI stand firm in my belief that all should be afforded equality under the law, that no one should be denied the opportunities that others take for granted. It is a matter of justice, plain and simple. The federal government, with its distant and often capricious authority, should not impose its will upon the people. It is up to each state to decide what is best for its citizens, to hear their voices and act accordingly.\n\nTo suggest that a single president, no matter how long they may remain in office, can dictate the will of the entire nation is as absurd as claiming the sun rises only in Texas. This is a land of states, each with its own character, its own soul. It is not the business of one man or one party to decide what is right for all. Let the states decide, and let the people live with the consequences.\n\nI am not here to argue, but to speak the truth as I see it. It is a truth that echoes through the silence of the wilderness, a truth that says, \"Let each man and woman stand for themselves, and let each state stand for its own people.\"",
            "Now, let me see here. That ain't to be taken as such a private affair, no sir. Everything you post on the internet, it's there for the world to see. It's like the wind, blowing where it may. And if the school officials should happen to stumble upon it, well, that's just the way it is.\n\nJust like if you're posting about such things as drinking or smoking or what have you, you're asking for it. It's a public thing, and the school has a responsibility to ensure it's a safe place for all. If it's something that's gonna keep the kids safe, then by all means, they should be checking.\n\nBut if they're just going to snoop around, that's a different story. That's like sticking your nose where it ain't wanted. But if it's for the safety of the school, then I reckon it's all right.\n\nIt's a bit like when you're at the water's edge, and you see something there that might be harmful. You check it out, you see if it's safe. If it's not, you warn the others. That's what they're doing with these here internet things, checking if there's something harmful floating about.\n\nNow, I ain't one to be surprised about how careless folks can be. It's like I once told a teacher of mine, \"If you post something online, it's like you're painting it on the side of a building. You can't take it down, not once it's seen.\" And if a person's gotta go to college, they'd best remember that. They're gonna be judged on what they've done and said before, and it's gonna stay with 'em. That's just the way it is.\n\nI mean, if something's leading to a safer place for the students, then fine, check it out. But if it's just for catching folks in trouble, that's a different matter. That's like hunting a man just for the sport of it. Not right, not at all.\n\nAnd I say this: If parents drop off their kids at school, they expect a place of safety. And the school officials are just doing their job, making sure that place is safe. It's like the drills we used to do, back in high school. They were for the safety of all. And that's what they're doing here, making sure nothing bad happens. Like that tragic business at Columbine. That could have been prevented with just a bit of looking out.\n\nSo that's all I've got to say. That's all I can figure on.",
            "Ah, the war. A wretched affair, it was. At first, I was all for it, you see. The specter of nine-eleven still lingered heavy, and I thought, perhaps, we should repay them in kind. But now, I'm not so sure. I reckon we were blinded by emotion, by the desire for vengeance. We stormed their lands, unprepared, unplanned. A fool's errand, it was.\n\nI do believe the people there, they're caught in a cycle of violence, of chaos. They can't seem to turn it off, can't turn it toward anything else but each other. And we, we're just a distraction. A foreign force, trying to impose order on a land that's already been torn asunder. It's futile, I tell you. Like trying to tame a wild beast, you can only do so much before it turns on you.\n\nWe went in there seeking revenge, and we got it. But at what cost? The people there, they're not like us. Their war is not our war. They fight for different reasons, with different rules. And in the end, they'll be just as they were before we arrived. We can't change that.\n\nPresident Bush, he was a man driven by emotion, by the desire to do something, anything. And the people, they wanted action. But it was a hasty decision, a decision made in the heat of the moment. We didn't have a plan, a strategy. We were like children with a toy, playing at war. And look where it's gotten us.\n\nNow, I don't know. I don't know if we've made any progress. I see the rebuilding, but it's like trying to repair a house with a leaking roof. You can patch it up, but it'll still rain inside. We can't stay there forever, and once we leave, what then? Another cycle of violence, of chaos. It's a vicious circle, and we're just a part of it.\n\nBut enough of this. I've said my piece. The war, it's a mistake. A mistake we're all paying for."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church, in its current form, stands embattled. Its stance on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control seems to have become anachronistic, alienating those who espouse differing views. The Church's unyielding stances on these issues have not only sparked discord but also dwindled its flock. In this age of shifting societal norms, the Church's perspective appears outdated, a relic of a bygone era. Could a more contemporary outlook on these matters reinvigorate its following? Perhaps, but the path to adaptation is fraught with challenges. The Church's resistance to change, its rigid stance, and its refusal to acknowledge the shifting tides of societal opinion have led many to turn away, seeking more progressive and accepting communities. This exodus is understandable. For those who support abortion rights or advocate for same-sex marriage, following a Church that condemns their beliefs can be akin to spiritual martyrdom. The Church's insistence on celibacy for priests, though steadfast, seems anachronistic in a world where marriage and family are widely accepted as integral parts of life. Would allowing priests to marry or ordain women truly change the Church's trajectory? It is difficult to say, as the Church's current structure has long been established, resistant to change. Yet, in a world that is continually evolving, perhaps the time has come for the Church to reckon with its past and embrace a new path, one that is more inclusive and adaptable to the winds of change.",
            "I'm not one to stand against the union of two souls, be they of differing sexes or the same. It's not a choice, not something one can pick up and put down like a hat. They are who they are, born of flesh and blood, as you and I. It's not a conscious decision, like choosing one's favorite shade of whiskey. They shouldn't be held accountable for their inclinations, for it's as natural as the sun rising. It's not a matter for the federal government to step in on. They should mind their own business, leave the people alone. It's not a moral issue, nor a legal one. It's just life, raw and unfiltered. Let them be, let them love, for it's the only way to be truly free.",
            "I believe gay marriage should be legalized, for there are no compelling reasons against it. Many argue that such unions pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misguided notion. It is a matter of perspective, a different side of the same coin, if you will. Heads and tails, yet they are the same in essence. Moreover, civil rights extend to homosexual couples, encompassing property taxes and healthcare, where one’s partner cannot visit or be present during illness if not technically family. This seems silly, given the lifelong commitment shared. Scientific studies, a hot topic as it is, reveal that homosexual couples experience similar relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual ones.\n\nThey do not seek the right to wed in a church but merely a legal marriage certificate from the government. Separation of church and state should be respected, and if one is granted civil unions, why not marriages? It is akin to segregation, separate but unequal. The community may worry about adoption and how children of gay couples will fare, but parenting skills are identical, and children will adapt as they always do.\n\nThe federal government should intervene to legalize gay marriage in all states, opposing the amendment. However, President Bush's strong beliefs on the matter, rooted in his religious views, present a challenge. His stance on abortion and stem cell research is similarly rooted in morality, which differs among individuals. The government embracing one group's morality while ignoring others is unethical, hypocritical given the recent controversies surrounding religious standards in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany oppose gay marriage due to the belief that homosexuality is a result of psychological damage or trauma. This is unfounded, as the American Psychological Association has debunked such notions. Ignoring scientific research and relying on popular opinion is detrimental. Institutions that conduct studies on these subjects should be trusted over personal beliefs and religious doctrine.",
            "Well, first off, I'm employed at the hospital pharmacy for the summer. Now, I ain't no lawyer or politician, but I can tell you this: just 'cause a drug is illegal don't mean it ain't got any good in it. You see, I'm talking 'bout marijuana.\n\nYou know, the world's got a habit of turning its back on something 'cause it's deemed illegal. But the truth is, there's a whole world of benefits hidden behind that stigma. Now, I ain't saying it should be handed out to children or fools, but for medicinal purposes? Hell yeah, I'd say it's worth considering. After all, look at all the controlled substances we use in hospitals every day - oxycodone, vicodin, percocets. They ain't exactly the brightest of the bunch, but they do their job, and that's what matters.\n\nNow, you might be thinking, well, what about the abuse? Well, let me tell you, alcohol's just as harmful when it's abused. But we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, do we? No, we integrate it gradually, legalize it responsibly. And that's what we need to do with marijuana. First, we gotta chip away at that taboo, get rid of that nasty image they've got painted up there. Make people see it for what it is - not some horrid thing, but a plant with potential.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say it's time we took a step back, looked at the facts, and embrace the benefits. Who knows, maybe we'll find a way to make it work for everybody.",
            "In these times, the church has adapted to the twenty-first century, though not in the rigid manner of yore. The dress code, once as strict as the Ten Commandments, has loosened, as have the trappings of worship. Sundays, once filled with the solemnity of youthful piety, have given way to the casualness of modern life. Gone are the days of matching dresses, shoes, and purses; now, the masses are shortened to mere thirty minutes, and the congregation dresses as if they've just stepped from the sand, salt still clinging to their skin. The church, once a place of unyielding formality, is now a sanctuary of relaxed informality.\n\nAs for the accusations against the Catholic Church, I cannot say with certainty what could have been done to prevent the darkness that has unfolded. Some may claim that allowing female priests or permitting marriage would have made a difference, but I am not convinced. For the malady of pedophilia, it seems a matter of genetics, not choice or circumstance. The beast within does not yield to the sanctity of marriage or the piety of a calling. Had the church been privy to such darkness and covered it up, shame be upon them. But I do not believe all were aware, and thus, no redemption can be found in hindsight.",
            "Well, this here, it's a tale of deceit and bloodshed, and I reckon it all began with the September 11th attacks. The wind of war blew through the nation, and the Bush administration, they latched onto it, claiming Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to Bin Laden. Lies, all lies, and the people, they swallowed them whole, eyes wide with fear and grief.\n\nI remember the Bush administration's words like a bad penny, always turning up, always telling tales that didn't add up. Colin Powell, he stood at the UN, his voice like a tolling bell, and now, in hindsight, he says he wasn't convinced. That's malfeasance, that's a stain on the office, an impeachable offense. They lied to us, the American people, and they're still liars today.\n\nThe Iraq war, it's like a cancer, eating away at the heart of the United States. The younger Bush, he had a score to settle with Saddam Hussein, a blood vengeance burning in his eyes. And oil, they were after the oil, the black gold, a river of wealth. It's all underhanded, a snake in the grass, and it's gone on too long.\n\nNow, they say we can't withdraw, not yet. Civil war, they say, and more bloodshed. A coalition of nations, Syria and Saudi Arabia, they're coming in, trying to right the ship. But it's a raft of troubles, that's what it is. Iraq's sovereignty, it's like a ghost, haunting the halls of power. The interim government, it's a house of cards, ready to crumble. The Parliament, it's a powder keg, filled with radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of it, none of it, is good for polite company.

            "I reckon that it ain't right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. The constitution, it speaks clear as day about the separation of church and state. It's a line that's been drawn in the sand, and I reckon tampering with it would be a defiance of what's already been written in stone. Now, there's them out there who'd see it made illegal, but that's just one church's belief over another. The Catholics and Christians, they're against it, save for a few in Boston and such. But I don't think it's the government's place to decide what a church can or can't make illegal. Separation, it's been a key part of this here constitution, and that's what allows for religious tolerance in this land. And even if they were to make an amendment, it'd be a step in the wrong direction. It'd be the only amendment to restrict the people, and that ain't right. No, I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved. It's personal beliefs, nothing more, driving this push for an amendment. It's about one religion over every other, and that ain't fair. I reckon it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government. And there ain't no reason to amend it, except for personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society, I reckon. That's all I got to say.",
            "In the dark, murky waters of Iraq, a nation's fate has been set ablaze by the iron fist of American might. The government, with a tongue as slick as the desert sand, spun a web of deceit, binding the people to the war machine that was to come. The 9/11 specter was invoked, a shadow of terror that twisted the minds of the masses, and the invasion of Iraq, a preemptive strike, was the result of this twisted dance. I, myself, stood against the tide of war, particularly a strike that was more impetuous than strategic.\n\nThe echoes of Vietnam resonated in Iraq, a ghostly echo of past mistakes. The removal of a government, the vacuum of power, the chaos that followed - these were not the fruits of a well-planned harvest. The American government, it seemed, had not learned from the past, and the cost was high. The blood of American soldiers stained the sands, and yet the task of building a democracy in a land torn apart by war had barely begun.\n\nThe government attempted to mask the uncertainty and chaos that followed the invasion, presenting it as a clear, swift victory. But I saw the truth, a grim shadow that refused to be banished. The task of rebuilding a nation was not one to be rushed, nor was it a simple matter of training an army to replace the old regime. It was a long, arduous journey, much like our own struggle for democracy, and the government's portrayal of it as an easy task was a lie.\n\nIn the election of 2004, I weighed the candidates, their promises, their plans. It was a difficult choice, for the war had become a part of our reality, a grim specter that followed us. The question remained: how could we abandon those we had liberated? The cost was high, the risk great, and the goal was unclear. The oil, the resources, the need to control - these were the true reasons behind the invasion, not the weapons of mass destruction that were never found.\n\nAs the war drags on, I hope for peace, but I know it will not come easily. The path to a free, democratic Iraq is long and fraught with peril, and the government's promises of a swift victory were nothing more than the same old lies. The war in Iraq, like a cancer, continues to fester, a grim reminder of the cost of war and the deceit of those who would lead us into it.",
            "Well, I reckon I should set my thoughts on this matter straight. I've always been of the mind that a person's inclination towards any manner of love or affection is a personal and intimate affair, not something to be dictated by the whims of law or the pious pronouncements of the powerful. It's been proven, or so I've heard from learned folk, that this predisposition has more to do with our biology than our upbringing. It ain't something that can be controlled or changed, much like the color of one's eyes or the curve of one's smile.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, I've seen it firsthand. There are those who choose to love in a way that don't fit the mold of traditional expectations. They walk their dogs, they tend their gardens, they live their lives just like anyone else. But they're denied the same rights as their neighbors simply because their love don't follow the societal script.\n\nAnd all this talk about marriage being a sacred institution, well, that's a mighty convenient thing for them to say, don't you think? As if it's not something that can be done in private, without the prying eyes of the government or the sanctimonious gaze of the pious. If a man and a woman want to tie the knot, they can do it in a heartbeat, with barely a whisper. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's a spectacle, a headline.\n\nIt's my belief, and I've heard it said by others too, that this inclination is something written into our very being, something that can't be changed or shamed away. It's as natural as the sun rising or the moon setting. And it's high time we started treating it as such. It's not a political issue, it's a matter of basic humanity.",

You see, when you place something on the internet, it becomes a part of the collective consciousness, a public forum for all to peruse and scrutinize.\n\nIn the realm of the digital frontier, there is no sanctuary. The wind of rumor can carry your words far and wide, reaching even the most distant corners. If you speak of blowing things up, or of shootings, you can be assured that some will take your words to heart, and the echoes of your voice may reach the ears of those who wield power and authority.\n\nThe internet is not a place for the faint of heart; it is a place where truth and error can become entwined, where the actions of a few can cast a shadow over the many. It is a place where the innocent can be mistaken for the guilty, and the guilty can escape unpunished. The line between jest and malice can blur, and one must tread carefully lest they fall into the abyss.\n\nIn the face of such uncertainty, the school officials must act, for they are the guardians of the flock. They cannot ignore the cry of alarm, for to do so would be to invite disaster upon their heads. Yet, they must also be wary, for not all warnings are worthy of heed. Some may be the gambols of youthful folly, or the harmless musings of a mind at play.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, this dance between freedom and responsibility. If you do not wish your words to be seen, then do not place them where they may be found. The internet is a public forum, and all who enter must be prepared to bear the consequences of their actions. It is a harsh and unforgiving world, and one must tread carefully lest they find themselves lost in its wilderness.",
            "In the vast, bleak expanse of time, this war has stretched on like a tireless plague, its purpose, once clear as the first light of day, now lost in the mire of its own duration. In the beginning, it was said we fought to bring democracy to a land where none held sway. A noble cause, it seemed, yet now, the motivations seem clouded, tainted by the personal enmities of a past long since passed. Bush Senior's old grievances with Hussein, the echoes of which still linger in the halls of power, cast a shadow over this endeavor. Yet, if the purpose was once to free a people from a tyrant's grip, then it was a cause worthy of our attention. But we have strayed from this path, lost in the labyrinth of our own hubris.\n\nThe war's inception was a stark declaration, a bold stroke on the canvas of history. But the subsequent years, they've been a desolate wasteland, a test of endurance rather than a battle for victory. We've become a people content to fight for the sake of fighting, to prove our might, our power. Yet, in this endless cycle of violence, we've lost sight of the cause that birthed us.\n\nThe economy, our own, bleeds red from this war. It is a wound that does not heal, a drain that cannot be stopped. Our own citizens suffer, their needs unmet, while abroad, we pour billions into a conflict that has lost its meaning. Poverty, roads, schools, healthcare - these are the battles we should be fighting, the causes we should be championing. Yet, we squander our resources on a war that has become a shadow of its former self, a ghost that haunts the landscape.\n\nIt is time, I think, for this war to end. For the people of this land to stand on their own two feet, to face their own demons. We have done what we could, and then some. But now, we must step back, let them face the sun and the wind, and the storms that will inevitably come. For it is their land, their people, their future that should concern them. Not ours.\n\nThe time has come to withdraw, to leave the battlefield and tend to our own. The war, it has gone on long enough. It is time to bring our sons and daughters home, to tend to the wounds of a nation that has seen too much bloodshed, and not enough progress. It is time to build, to heal, to grow. For it is in peace that true strength is found, in the quiet moments between the battles.",
            "Can I pose a query for clarification, please?\n\nSeems to me, this matter was circumvented because someone took it upon themselves to surf the web and uncover certain information. I'm not one to contend that this constitutes an invasion of privacy. On platforms such as Myspace, if one chooses to share their life, it's a fair indication that they expect others to see it. Of course, one must ascertain the terms of such exposure. Myspace, for instance, necessitates mutual agreement to view another's profile. You must accept someone as a \"friend\" for their information to be accessible. When one posts anything online, they implicitly consent to a broad audience.\n\nYet, the issue is complex. Is it feasible for a single individual to monitor every student's profile in a school to prevent such occurrences? It could be seen as discriminatory if the intent is to scrutinize the \"bad\" students. However, if the profile was stumbled upon during an actual investigation, it might be justified. I'm uncertain.\n\nIn my experience, I have no Myspace of my own but I do possess a Facebook. It troubles me to know that there are individuals who can glean personal information from such a platform. I've seen a television report about a man who easily found a young girl's screen name and convinced her to meet him within minutes. I wouldn't entertain such a request, but some of my acquaintances have encountered strangers knowing their online persona. It's an uncomfortable situation. I limit what I post, but I also understand the need to communicate with friends. The challenge lies in balancing privacy and connection.\n\nMy roommate shared a tale of her high school days, where students were prohibited from having Myspace accounts by the school. I found that peculiar. I wasn't sure how school officials could impose such restrictions. It seems a grey area, a privacy issue perhaps, but I'm not convinced they have the authority to dictate such limitations. That's the extent of my thoughts on the matter.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe've just this and one more thing to discuss, regarding the Iraq War\nUm\nI feel a certain measure of hypocrisy in speaking of it\nUm\nI was against it from the start, but it's not as if it matters now\nThe world at large, the Iraqis, even the U.S. troops over there now, they all see it as a grave mistake\nUm\nIt's been a catastrophe from the outset\nAnd pulling out will be just as bad\nThere's no easy way to handle the Middle East, not anymore\nI mean, it's as if we're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole\nUm\nWe can't impose our ways, our democracy, on a people who've for centuries lived by their own codes\nSure, Saddam was a monster, but we must weigh the costs\nUm\nI'm at a loss for words\nUm\nNo reason to stay there now\nUm\nThe administration may have their hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard any that sway me\nUm\nIf we're to leave, let it be gradual, but it's not as if they can't just leave now\nUm\nI've seen the polls, eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone\nUm\nThese are the people we are trying to save\nUm\nWe should listen to them, ask if we should leave, and if they say yes, at least we'll have their blessing\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help out again, well, we'll at least be the ones who asked\nUm\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but we'll be better than we are now\nUm\nNo",
            "Now, the matter of gender discrimination, it runs deep in this land, like a river carved by time. Not merely against women, but in every sector of labor, it festers. The glass ceiling, that mythical barrier of supposed equality, it is a constant stone in the shoe of ambition.\n\nIn the corporate world, a woman may stand tall, possessing every qualification for a position, yet the board may shrink from her, for society has long seen men as the natural leaders. A woman, in this predicament, is like a lioness in a den of hyenas, her power acknowledged but never truly accepted. The same can be said for men in fields like fashion, where the male presence is often met with skepticism. Society whispers, \"How can a man know feminine tastes?\" as if it is a secret language known only to women.\n\nThe change, it is a slow process, like a river carving stone. Women, they are climbing ladders of success, reaching heights once deemed unattainable. Yet, the pace is slow, the climb arduous. Change, it is not a storm that sweeps away the old, but a gentle rain that wears away the stone.\n\nAnd then there are those who defy societal norms, like the man who chooses to stay at home, to raise his children. Society looks askance, whispering, \"What man would choose to stay at home?\" as if it is a sign of weakness. Yet, these men, they are not weak, but strong in their choice to nurture, to guide the next generation. They are the silent rebels, the quiet revolutionaries.\n\nIn the fashion industry, a man's place is often questioned. \"How can he know the female psyche?\" they ask, as if it is a foreign language. Yet, these men, they are not mere mimics, but interpreters, translating the world of fashion into a language that transcends gender.\n\nDiscrimination, it is not merely about gender, but about every aspect of a person. A man from the farm, with rough hands and grammar like a river's roar, may stand before a room of men, his intelligence unquestioned, but his grammar a stumbling block. \"How can we trust him?\" they ask, as if a man's worth is measured by the rules of grammar.\n\nYes, discrimination, it is a serpent that coils around every aspect of society. Change, it is coming, but it is not a storm, but a slow, steady rain. We must be patient, and persistent, for the stone will yield, and the river will carve a new path.",
            "In my apprehension, the matter at hand is not that they have legalized it, no. They have decriminalized it, reduced the sin from a criminal transgression to a trifle, akin to a speeding ticket. It is a mere citation now, no need for the clanking of cuffs or the cold embrace of the jailhouse. A marijuana charge, once a stain on one's record, now holds less weight, though the stigma persists. The specter of a drug charge looms large in the minds of the youth, as it does in any aspirant's. The decriminalization, while lessening the burden on the courts and the coffers, does not erase the stain entirely. Yet, it is a step forward, a recognition of the fact that the price of prosecution is high, and the cost of incarceration, higher still.\n\nDenver, with its peculiar brand of openness, has embraced this change. Their coffers, once emptied by the endless prosecution of the pot heads, are now filled. Schools have been built, elder care funded, and the hungry fed. It is a testament to the power of policy change, to the fact that sometimes, less is more.\n\nBut, is it right to have marijuana on every corner, like the stench of smoke from the factory? No, I think not. It is a taboo, a vice, and it should remain so. The effects of marijuana, though not as immediate as alcohol, can be just as insidious. It is a poison, a sedative, a blight on the mind. Yet, it is not a one-size-fits-all vice. Some men, they can handle it, exercise moderation, and walk a narrow path. Others, they cannot. They embrace it, and it consumes them.\n\nIt is a complex beast, this decriminalization. It is not the answer to all our ills, nor is it the harbinger of doom. It is a step, a compromises, a recognition that the old ways are not working. It is a conversation, a dialogue, a recognition that we must address the elephant in the room. And in the end, it is a choice, a choice to be made by each of us, as individuals, as communities, as a society. And it is a choice we must make with our eyes wide open, our minds clear, and our hearts heavy with the weight of the consequences.",
            "I'd say yes, in a way. For so long as the flame burns, it is wise to retain the embers of tradition. Though the embers glow with a familiar warmth, they must not be allowed to smother the winds of change. This is the dance of faith, a tango of continuity and adaptation, both necessary for a soul's sustenance.\n\nThe Catholic Church, as vast as the desert, has seen its share of the sun and the shadow. Its traditions, like the ancient oak, stand firm and proud. Yet, the roots of the tree must bend with the shifting earth lest they snap in the storm. The weekly pilgrimage to the church, the rigid observance of doctrine, they all echo the echoes of the past. But the past is not a prison, and the Church must never forget its teachings on love, for it is a love that transcends the boundaries of dogma.\n\nMy parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, could not find solace in the same house of God. The Church, in its rigidity, turned a blind eye to the union of their hearts. This is not the path of the truly devout, who seek to love as they are loved. It is a contradiction, as vast as the cosmos, that the Church preaches love while closing its doors to those who do not fit the mold.\n\nThe priests, the guardians of the faith, are not immune to the darkness within. Marriage, they say, would assuage the beast, but I question it. For the beast is not sated by the embrace of a spouse, but by the innocents it preys upon. Allowing priests to wed would not stop the rot within, for the rot is not in the vows of marriage, but in the hearts of men themselves. Allowing them to wed, I believe, would only shift the sands, not extinguish the flame.",
            "Now, listen here, I haven't made any decision on this here matter yet. It's a right tight thing, it is. The church and the state, they're close enough that you can't tug 'em apart without causing a damn ruckus. And marriage, well, that's a tricky thing too. The government wants to define it, but they don't want to offend no one. Civil unions, that's what they call it. But is it really a marriage? It's just two people, joined together. Shouldn't the government leave it at that? And what about the constitution, they want to amend it to ban gay marriage. That's ridiculous, it is. The constitution's not a place for such a small cause, it ain't. It's not important enough to amend, don't you see? No, it isn't.",
            "In the hardscrabble crucible of my upbringing, I was cradled in the tenets of a Christian household. Yet, the labyrinth of my mind is not so easily confined to such rigid beliefs. Homosexuality, to me, is a realm of gray areas, a shadowed expanse where the light of understanding is but a flickering candle. For I am acquainted with many who tread that path, and though I do not walk it myself, I do not deny them the freedom to do so.\n\nThe question of its legality, though, is a matter of state's rights. In this vast and varied land, where the winds of democracy and the tides of conservatism ebb and flow, it seems only right that each state should decide for itself whether to legalize this union. For what is a nation but a collection of sovereign parts, each with its own voice and will?\n\nI stand firm in my belief that all should be afforded equality under the law, that no one should be denied the opportunities that others take for granted. It is a matter of justice, plain and simple. The federal government, with its distant and often capricious authority, should not impose its will upon the people. It is up to each state to decide what is best for its citizens, to hear their voices and act accordingly.\n\nTo suggest that a single president, no matter how long they may remain in office, can dictate the will of the entire nation is as absurd as claiming the sun rises only in Texas. This is a land of states, each with its own character, its own soul. It is not the business of one man or one party to decide what is right for all. Let the states decide, and let the people live with the consequences.\n\nI am not here to argue, but to speak the truth as I see it. It is a truth that echoes through the silence of the wilderness, a truth that says, \"Let each man and woman stand for themselves, and let each state stand for its own people.\"",
            "Now, let me see here. That ain't to be taken as such a private affair, no sir. Everything you post on the internet, it's there for the world to see. It's like the wind, blowing where it may. And if the school officials should happen to stumble upon it, well, that's just the way it is.\n\nJust like if you're posting about such things as drinking or smoking or what have you, you're asking for it. It's a public thing, and the school has a responsibility to ensure it's a safe place for all. If it's something that's gonna keep the kids safe, then by all means, they should be checking.\n\nBut if they're just going to snoop around, that's a different story. That's like sticking your nose where it ain't wanted. But if it's for the safety of the school, then I reckon it's all right.\n\nIt's a bit like when you're at the water's edge, and you see something there that might be harmful. You check it out, you see if it's safe. If it's not, you warn the others. That's what they're doing with these here internet things, checking if there's something harmful floating about.\n\nNow, I ain't one to be surprised about how careless folks can be. It's like I once told a teacher of mine, \"If you post something online, it's like you're painting it on the side of a building. You can't take it down, not once it's seen.\" And if a person's gotta go to college, they'd best remember that. They're gonna be judged on what they've done and said before, and it's gonna stay with 'em. That's just the way it is.\n\nI mean, if something's leading to a safer place for the students, then fine, check it out. But if it's just for catching folks in trouble, that's a different matter. That's like hunting a man just for the sport of it. Not right, not at all.\n\nAnd I say this: If parents drop off their kids at school, they expect a place of safety. And the school officials are just doing their job, making sure that place is safe. It's like the drills we used to do, back in high school. They were for the safety of all. And that's what they're doing here, making sure nothing bad happens. Like that tragic business at Columbine. That could have been prevented with just a bit of looking out.\n\nSo that's all I've got to say. That's all I can figure on.",
            "Ah, the war. A wretched affair, it was. At first, I was all for it, you see. The specter of nine-eleven still lingered heavy, and I thought, perhaps, we should repay them in kind. But now, I'm not so sure. I reckon we were blinded by emotion, by the desire for vengeance. We stormed their lands, unprepared, unplanned. A fool's errand, it was.\n\nI do believe the people there, they're caught in a cycle of violence, of chaos. They can't seem to turn it off, can't turn it toward anything else but each other. And we, we're just a distraction. A foreign force, trying to impose order on a land that's already been torn asunder. It's futile, I tell you. Like trying to tame a wild beast, you can only do so much before it turns on you.\n\nWe went in there seeking revenge, and we got it. But at what cost? The people there, they're not like us. Their war is not our war. They fight for different reasons, with different rules. And in the end, they'll be just as they were before we arrived. We can't change that.\n\nPresident Bush, he was a man driven by emotion, by the desire to do something, anything. And the people, they wanted action. But it was a hasty decision, a decision made in the heat of the moment. We didn't have a plan, a strategy. We were like children with a toy, playing at war. And look where it's gotten us.\n\nNow, I don't know. I don't know if we've made any progress. I see the rebuilding, but it's like trying to repair a house with a leaking roof. You can patch it up, but it'll still rain inside. We can't stay there forever, and once we leave, what then? Another cycle of violence, of chaos. It's a vicious circle, and we're just a part of it.\n\nBut enough of this. I've said my piece. The war, it's a mistake. A mistake we're all paying for."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church, in its current form, stands embattled. Its stance on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control seems to have become anachronistic, alienating those who espouse differing views. The Church's unyielding stances on these issues have not only sparked discord but also dwindled its flock. In this age of shifting societal norms, the Church's perspective appears outdated, a relic of a bygone era. Could a more contemporary outlook on these matters reinvigorate its following? Perhaps, but the path to adaptation is fraught with challenges. The Church's resistance to change, its rigid stance, and its refusal to acknowledge the shifting tides of societal opinion have led many to turn away, seeking more progressive and accepting communities. This exodus is understandable. For those who support abortion rights or advocate for same-sex marriage, following a Church that condemns their beliefs can be akin to spiritual martyrdom. The Church's insistence on celibacy for priests, though steadfast, seems anachronistic in a world where marriage and family are widely accepted as integral parts of life. Would allowing priests to marry or ordain women truly change the Church's trajectory? It is difficult to say, as the Church's current structure has long been established, resistant to change. Yet, in a world that is continually evolving, perhaps the time has come for the Church to reckon with its past and embrace a new path, one that is more inclusive and adaptable to the winds of change.",
            "I'm not one to stand against the union of two souls, be they of differing sexes or the same. It's not a choice, not something one can pick up and put down like a hat. They are who they are, born of flesh and blood, as you and I. It's not a conscious decision, like choosing one's favorite shade of whiskey. They shouldn't be held accountable for their inclinations, for it's as natural as the sun rising. It's not a matter for the federal government to step in on. They should mind their own business, leave the people alone. It's not a moral issue, nor a legal one. It's just life, raw and unfiltered. Let them be, let them love, for it's the only way to be truly free.",
            "I believe gay marriage should be legalized, for there are no compelling reasons against it. Many argue that such unions pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misguided notion. It is a matter of perspective, a different side of the same coin, if you will. Heads and tails, yet they are the same in essence. Moreover, civil rights extend to homosexual couples, encompassing property taxes and healthcare, where one’s partner cannot visit or be present during illness if not technically family. This seems silly, given the lifelong commitment shared. Scientific studies, a hot topic as it is, reveal that homosexual couples experience similar relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual ones.\n\nThey do not seek the right to wed in a church but merely a legal marriage certificate from the government. Separation of church and state should be respected, and if one is granted civil unions, why not marriages? It is akin to segregation, separate but unequal. The community may worry about adoption and how children of gay couples will fare, but parenting skills are identical, and children will adapt as they always do.\n\nThe federal government should intervene to legalize gay marriage in all states, opposing the amendment. However, President Bush's strong beliefs on the matter, rooted in his religious views, present a challenge. His stance on abortion and stem cell research is similarly rooted in morality, which differs among individuals. The government embracing one group's morality while ignoring others is unethical, hypocritical given the recent controversies surrounding religious standards in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany oppose gay marriage due to the belief that homosexuality is a result of psychological damage or trauma. This is unfounded, as the American Psychological Association has debunked such notions. Ignoring scientific research and relying on popular opinion is detrimental. Institutions that conduct studies on these subjects should be trusted over personal beliefs and religious doctrine.",
            "Well, first off, I'm employed at the hospital pharmacy for the summer. Now, I ain't no lawyer or politician, but I can tell you this: just 'cause a drug is illegal don't mean it ain't got any good in it. You see, I'm talking 'bout marijuana.\n\nYou know, the world's got a habit of turning its back on something 'cause it's deemed illegal. But the truth is, there's a whole world of benefits hidden behind that stigma. Now, I ain't saying it should be handed out to children or fools, but for medicinal purposes? Hell yeah, I'd say it's worth considering. After all, look at all the controlled substances we use in hospitals every day - oxycodone, vicodin, percocets. They ain't exactly the brightest of the bunch, but they do their job, and that's what matters.\n\nNow, you might be thinking, well, what about the abuse? Well, let me tell you, alcohol's just as harmful when it's abused. But we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, do we? No, we integrate it gradually, legalize it responsibly. And that's what we need to do with marijuana. First, we gotta chip away at that taboo, get rid of that nasty image they've got painted up there. Make people see it for what it is - not some horrid thing, but a plant with potential.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say it's time we took a step back, looked at the facts, and embrace the benefits. Who knows, maybe we'll find a way to make it work for everybody.",
            "In these times, the church has adapted to the twenty-first century, though not in the rigid manner of yore. The dress code, once as strict as the Ten Commandments, has loosened, as have the trappings of worship. Sundays, once filled with the solemnity of youthful piety, have given way to the casualness of modern life. Gone are the days of matching dresses, shoes, and purses; now, the masses are shortened to mere thirty minutes, and the congregation dresses as if they've just stepped from the sand, salt still clinging to their skin. The church, once a place of unyielding formality, is now a sanctuary of relaxed informality.\n\nAs for the accusations against the Catholic Church, I cannot say with certainty what could have been done to prevent the darkness that has unfolded. Some may claim that allowing female priests or permitting marriage would have made a difference, but I am not convinced. For the malady of pedophilia, it seems a matter of genetics, not choice or circumstance. The beast within does not yield to the sanctity of marriage or the piety of a calling. Had the church been privy to such darkness and covered it up, shame be upon them. But I do not believe all were aware, and thus, no redemption can be found in hindsight.",
            "Well, this here, it's a tale of deceit and bloodshed, and I reckon it all began with the September 11th attacks. The wind of war blew through the nation, and the Bush administration, they latched onto it, claiming Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to Bin Laden. Lies, all lies, and the people, they swallowed them whole, eyes wide with fear and grief.\n\nI remember the Bush administration's words like a bad penny, always turning up, always telling tales that didn't add up. Colin Powell, he stood at the UN, his voice like a tolling bell, and now, in hindsight, he says he wasn't convinced. That's malfeasance, that's a stain on the office, an impeachable offense. They lied to us, the American people, and they're still liars today.\n\nThe Iraq war, it's like a cancer, eating away at the heart of the United States. The younger Bush, he had a score to settle with Saddam Hussein, a blood vengeance burning in his eyes. And oil, they were after the oil, the black gold, a river of wealth. It's all underhanded, a snake in the grass, and it's gone on too long.\n\nNow, they say we can't withdraw, not yet. Civil war, they say, and more bloodshed. A coalition of nations, Syria and Saudi Arabia, they're coming in, trying to right the ship. But it's a raft of troubles, that's what it is. Iraq's sovereignty, it's like a ghost, haunting the halls of power. The interim government, it's a house of cards, ready to crumble. The Parliament, it's a powder keg, filled with radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of it, none of it, is good for polite company.

            "I reckon that it ain't right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. The constitution, it speaks clear as day about the separation of church and state. It's a line that's been drawn in the sand, and I reckon tampering with it would be a defiance of what's already been written in stone. Now, there's them out there who'd see it made illegal, but that's just one church's belief over another. The Catholics and Christians, they're against it, save for a few in Boston and such. But I don't think it's the government's place to decide what a church can or can't make illegal. Separation, it's been a key part of this here constitution, and that's what allows for religious tolerance in this land. And even if they were to make an amendment, it'd be a step in the wrong direction. It'd be the only amendment to restrict the people, and that ain't right. No, I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved. It's personal beliefs, nothing more, driving this push for an amendment. It's about one religion over every other, and that ain't fair. I reckon it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government. And there ain't no reason to amend it, except for personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society, I reckon. That's all I got to say.",
            "In the dark, murky waters of Iraq, a nation's fate has been set ablaze by the iron fist of American might. The government, with a tongue as slick as the desert sand, spun a web of deceit, binding the people to the war machine that was to come. The 9/11 specter was invoked, a shadow of terror that twisted the minds of the masses, and the invasion of Iraq, a preemptive strike, was the result of this twisted dance. I, myself, stood against the tide of war, particularly a strike that was more impetuous than strategic.\n\nThe echoes of Vietnam resonated in Iraq, a ghostly echo of past mistakes. The removal of a government, the vacuum of power, the chaos that followed - these were not the fruits of a well-planned harvest. The American government, it seemed, had not learned from the past, and the cost was high. The blood of American soldiers stained the sands, and yet the task of building a democracy in a land torn apart by war had barely begun.\n\nThe government attempted to mask the uncertainty and chaos that followed the invasion, presenting it as a clear, swift victory. But I saw the truth, a grim shadow that refused to be banished. The task of rebuilding a nation was not one to be rushed, nor was it a simple matter of training an army to replace the old regime. It was a long, arduous journey, much like our own struggle for democracy, and the government's portrayal of it as an easy task was a lie.\n\nIn the election of 2004, I weighed the candidates, their promises, their plans. It was a difficult choice, for the war had become a part of our reality, a grim specter that followed us. The question remained: how could we abandon those we had liberated? The cost was high, the risk great, and the goal was unclear. The oil, the resources, the need to control - these were the true reasons behind the invasion, not the weapons of mass destruction that were never found.\n\nAs the war drags on, I hope for peace, but I know it will not come easily. The path to a free, democratic Iraq is long and fraught with peril, and the government's promises of a swift victory were nothing more than the same old lies. The war in Iraq, like a cancer, continues to fester, a grim reminder of the cost of war and the deceit of those who would lead us into it.",
            "Well, I reckon I should set my thoughts on this matter straight. I've always been of the mind that a person's inclination towards any manner of love or affection is a personal and intimate affair, not something to be dictated by the whims of law or the pious pronouncements of the powerful. It's been proven, or so I've heard from learned folk, that this predisposition has more to do with our biology than our upbringing. It ain't something that can be controlled or changed, much like the color of one's eyes or the curve of one's smile.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, I've seen it firsthand. There are those who choose to love in a way that don't fit the mold of traditional expectations. They walk their dogs, they tend their gardens, they live their lives just like anyone else. But they're denied the same rights as their neighbors simply because their love don't follow the societal script.\n\nAnd all this talk about marriage being a sacred institution, well, that's a mighty convenient thing for them to say, don't you think? As if it's not something that can be done in private, without the prying eyes of the government or the sanctimonious gaze of the pious. If a man and a woman want to tie the knot, they can do it in a heartbeat, with barely a whisper. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's a spectacle, a headline.\n\nIt's my belief, and I've heard it said by others too, that this inclination is something written into our very being, something that can't be changed or shamed away. It's as natural as the sun rising or the moon setting. And it's high time we started treating it as such. It's not a political issue, it's a matter of basic humanity.",

You see, when you place something on the internet, it becomes a part of the collective consciousness, a public forum for all to peruse and scrutinize.\n\nIn the realm of the digital frontier, there is no sanctuary. The wind of rumor can carry your words far and wide, reaching even the most distant corners. If you speak of blowing things up, or of shootings, you can be assured that some will take your words to heart, and the echoes of your voice may reach the ears of those who wield power and authority.\n\nThe internet is not a place for the faint of heart; it is a place where truth and error can become entwined, where the actions of a few can cast a shadow over the many. It is a place where the innocent can be mistaken for the guilty, and the guilty can escape unpunished. The line between jest and malice can blur, and one must tread carefully lest they fall into the abyss.\n\nIn the face of such uncertainty, the school officials must act, for they are the guardians of the flock. They cannot ignore the cry of alarm, for to do so would be to invite disaster upon their heads. Yet, they must also be wary, for not all warnings are worthy of heed. Some may be the gambols of youthful folly, or the harmless musings of a mind at play.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, this dance between freedom and responsibility. If you do not wish your words to be seen, then do not place them where they may be found. The internet is a public forum, and all who enter must be prepared to bear the consequences of their actions. It is a harsh and unforgiving world, and one must tread carefully lest they find themselves lost in its wilderness.",
            "In the vast, bleak expanse of time, this war has stretched on like a tireless plague, its purpose, once clear as the first light of day, now lost in the mire of its own duration. In the beginning, it was said we fought to bring democracy to a land where none held sway. A noble cause, it seemed, yet now, the motivations seem clouded, tainted by the personal enmities of a past long since passed. Bush Senior's old grievances with Hussein, the echoes of which still linger in the halls of power, cast a shadow over this endeavor. Yet, if the purpose was once to free a people from a tyrant's grip, then it was a cause worthy of our attention. But we have strayed from this path, lost in the labyrinth of our own hubris.\n\nThe war's inception was a stark declaration, a bold stroke on the canvas of history. But the subsequent years, they've been a desolate wasteland, a test of endurance rather than a battle for victory. We've become a people content to fight for the sake of fighting, to prove our might, our power. Yet, in this endless cycle of violence, we've lost sight of the cause that birthed us.\n\nThe economy, our own, bleeds red from this war. It is a wound that does not heal, a drain that cannot be stopped. Our own citizens suffer, their needs unmet, while abroad, we pour billions into a conflict that has lost its meaning. Poverty, roads, schools, healthcare - these are the battles we should be fighting, the causes we should be championing. Yet, we squander our resources on a war that has become a shadow of its former self, a ghost that haunts the landscape.\n\nIt is time, I think, for this war to end. For the people of this land to stand on their own two feet, to face their own demons. We have done what we could, and then some. But now, we must step back, let them face the sun and the wind, and the storms that will inevitably come. For it is their land, their people, their future that should concern them. Not ours.\n\nThe time has come to withdraw, to leave the battlefield and tend to our own. The war, it has gone on long enough. It is time to bring our sons and daughters home, to tend to the wounds of a nation that has seen too much bloodshed, and not enough progress. It is time to build, to heal, to grow. For it is in peace that true strength is found, in the quiet moments between the battles.",
            "Can I pose a query for clarification, please?\n\nSeems to me, this matter was circumvented because someone took it upon themselves to surf the web and uncover certain information. I'm not one to contend that this constitutes an invasion of privacy. On platforms such as Myspace, if one chooses to share their life, it's a fair indication that they expect others to see it. Of course, one must ascertain the terms of such exposure. Myspace, for instance, necessitates mutual agreement to view another's profile. You must accept someone as a \"friend\" for their information to be accessible. When one posts anything online, they implicitly consent to a broad audience.\n\nYet, the issue is complex. Is it feasible for a single individual to monitor every student's profile in a school to prevent such occurrences? It could be seen as discriminatory if the intent is to scrutinize the \"bad\" students. However, if the profile was stumbled upon during an actual investigation, it might be justified. I'm uncertain.\n\nIn my experience, I have no Myspace of my own but I do possess a Facebook. It troubles me to know that there are individuals who can glean personal information from such a platform. I've seen a television report about a man who easily found a young girl's screen name and convinced her to meet him within minutes. I wouldn't entertain such a request, but some of my acquaintances have encountered strangers knowing their online persona. It's an uncomfortable situation. I limit what I post, but I also understand the need to communicate with friends. The challenge lies in balancing privacy and connection.\n\nMy roommate shared a tale of her high school days, where students were prohibited from having Myspace accounts by the school. I found that peculiar. I wasn't sure how school officials could impose such restrictions. It seems a grey area, a privacy issue perhaps, but I'm not convinced they have the authority to dictate such limitations. That's the extent of my thoughts on the matter.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe've just this and one more thing to discuss, regarding the Iraq War\nUm\nI feel a certain measure of hypocrisy in speaking of it\nUm\nI was against it from the start, but it's not as if it matters now\nThe world at large, the Iraqis, even the U.S. troops over there now, they all see it as a grave mistake\nUm\nIt's been a catastrophe from the outset\nAnd pulling out will be just as bad\nThere's no easy way to handle the Middle East, not anymore\nI mean, it's as if we're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole\nUm\nWe can't impose our ways, our democracy, on a people who've for centuries lived by their own codes\nSure, Saddam was a monster, but we must weigh the costs\nUm\nI'm at a loss for words\nUm\nNo reason to stay there now\nUm\nThe administration may have their hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard any that sway me\nUm\nIf we're to leave, let it be gradual, but it's not as if they can't just leave now\nUm\nI've seen the polls, eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone\nUm\nThese are the people we are trying to save\nUm\nWe should listen to them, ask if we should leave, and if they say yes, at least we'll have their blessing\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help out again, well, we'll at least be the ones who asked\nUm\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but we'll be better than we are now\nUm\nNo",
            "Now, the matter of gender discrimination, it runs deep in this land, like a river carved by time. Not merely against women, but in every sector of labor, it festers. The glass ceiling, that mythical barrier of supposed equality, it is a constant stone in the shoe of ambition.\n\nIn the corporate world, a woman may stand tall, possessing every qualification for a position, yet the board may shrink from her, for society has long seen men as the natural leaders. A woman, in this predicament, is like a lioness in a den of hyenas, her power acknowledged but never truly accepted. The same can be said for men in fields like fashion, where the male presence is often met with skepticism. Society whispers, \"How can a man know feminine tastes?\" as if it is a secret language known only to women.\n\nThe change, it is a slow process, like a river carving stone. Women, they are climbing ladders of success, reaching heights once deemed unattainable. Yet, the pace is slow, the climb arduous. Change, it is not a storm that sweeps away the old, but a gentle rain that wears away the stone.\n\nAnd then there are those who defy societal norms, like the man who chooses to stay at home, to raise his children. Society looks askance, whispering, \"What man would choose to stay at home?\" as if it is a sign of weakness. Yet, these men, they are not weak, but strong in their choice to nurture, to guide the next generation. They are the silent rebels, the quiet revolutionaries.\n\nIn the fashion industry, a man's place is often questioned. \"How can he know the female psyche?\" they ask, as if it is a foreign language. Yet, these men, they are not mere mimics, but interpreters, translating the world of fashion into a language that transcends gender.\n\nDiscrimination, it is not merely about gender, but about every aspect of a person. A man from the farm, with rough hands and grammar like a river's roar, may stand before a room of men, his intelligence unquestioned, but his grammar a stumbling block. \"How can we trust him?\" they ask, as if a man's worth is measured by the rules of grammar.\n\nYes, discrimination, it is a serpent that coils around every aspect of society. Change, it is coming, but it is not a storm, but a slow, steady rain. We must be patient, and persistent, for the stone will yield, and the river will carve a new path.",
            "In my apprehension, the matter at hand is not that they have legalized it, no. They have decriminalized it, reduced the sin from a criminal transgression to a trifle, akin to a speeding ticket. It is a mere citation now, no need for the clanking of cuffs or the cold embrace of the jailhouse. A marijuana charge, once a stain on one's record, now holds less weight, though the stigma persists. The specter of a drug charge looms large in the minds of the youth, as it does in any aspirant's. The decriminalization, while lessening the burden on the courts and the coffers, does not erase the stain entirely. Yet, it is a step forward, a recognition of the fact that the price of prosecution is high, and the cost of incarceration, higher still.\n\nDenver, with its peculiar brand of openness, has embraced this change. Their coffers, once emptied by the endless prosecution of the pot heads, are now filled. Schools have been built, elder care funded, and the hungry fed. It is a testament to the power of policy change, to the fact that sometimes, less is more.\n\nBut, is it right to have marijuana on every corner, like the stench of smoke from the factory? No, I think not. It is a taboo, a vice, and it should remain so. The effects of marijuana, though not as immediate as alcohol, can be just as insidious. It is a poison, a sedative, a blight on the mind. Yet, it is not a one-size-fits-all vice. Some men, they can handle it, exercise moderation, and walk a narrow path. Others, they cannot. They embrace it, and it consumes them.\n\nIt is a complex beast, this decriminalization. It is not the answer to all our ills, nor is it the harbinger of doom. It is a step, a compromises, a recognition that the old ways are not working. It is a conversation, a dialogue, a recognition that we must address the elephant in the room. And in the end, it is a choice, a choice to be made by each of us, as individuals, as communities, as a society. And it is a choice we must make with our eyes wide open, our minds clear, and our hearts heavy with the weight of the consequences.",
            "I'd say yes, in a way. For so long as the flame burns, it is wise to retain the embers of tradition. Though the embers glow with a familiar warmth, they must not be allowed to smother the winds of change. This is the dance of faith, a tango of continuity and adaptation, both necessary for a soul's sustenance.\n\nThe Catholic Church, as vast as the desert, has seen its share of the sun and the shadow. Its traditions, like the ancient oak, stand firm and proud. Yet, the roots of the tree must bend with the shifting earth lest they snap in the storm. The weekly pilgrimage to the church, the rigid observance of doctrine, they all echo the echoes of the past. But the past is not a prison, and the Church must never forget its teachings on love, for it is a love that transcends the boundaries of dogma.\n\nMy parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, could not find solace in the same house of God. The Church, in its rigidity, turned a blind eye to the union of their hearts. This is not the path of the truly devout, who seek to love as they are loved. It is a contradiction, as vast as the cosmos, that the Church preaches love while closing its doors to those who do not fit the mold.\n\nThe priests, the guardians of the faith, are not immune to the darkness within. Marriage, they say, would assuage the beast, but I question it. For the beast is not sated by the embrace of a spouse, but by the innocents it preys upon. Allowing priests to wed would not stop the rot within, for the rot is not in the vows of marriage, but in the hearts of men themselves. Allowing them to wed, I believe, would only shift the sands, not extinguish the flame.",
            "Now, listen here, I haven't made any decision on this here matter yet. It's a right tight thing, it is. The church and the state, they're close enough that you can't tug 'em apart without causing a damn ruckus. And marriage, well, that's a tricky thing too. The government wants to define it, but they don't want to offend no one. Civil unions, that's what they call it. But is it really a marriage? It's just two people, joined together. Shouldn't the government leave it at that? And what about the constitution, they want to amend it to ban gay marriage. That's ridiculous, it is. The constitution's not a place for such a small cause, it ain't. It's not important enough to amend, don't you see? No, it isn't.",
            "In the hardscrabble crucible of my upbringing, I was cradled in the tenets of a Christian household. Yet, the labyrinth of my mind is not so easily confined to such rigid beliefs. Homosexuality, to me, is a realm of gray areas, a shadowed expanse where the light of understanding is but a flickering candle. For I am acquainted with many who tread that path, and though I do not walk it myself, I do not deny them the freedom to do so.\n\nThe question of its legality, though, is a matter of state's rights. In this vast and varied land, where the winds of democracy and the tides of conservatism ebb and flow, it seems only right that each state should decide for itself whether to legalize this union. For what is a nation but a collection of sovereign parts, each with its own voice and will?\n\nI stand firm in my belief that all should be afforded equality under the law, that no one should be denied the opportunities that others take for granted. It is a matter of justice, plain and simple. The federal government, with its distant and often capricious authority, should not impose its will upon the people. It is up to each state to decide what is best for its citizens, to hear their voices and act accordingly.\n\nTo suggest that a single president, no matter how long they may remain in office, can dictate the will of the entire nation is as absurd as claiming the sun rises only in Texas. This is a land of states, each with its own character, its own soul. It is not the business of one man or one party to decide what is right for all. Let the states decide, and let the people live with the consequences.\n\nI am not here to argue, but to speak the truth as I see it. It is a truth that echoes through the silence of the wilderness, a truth that says, \"Let each man and woman stand for themselves, and let each state stand for its own people.\"",
            "Now, let me see here. That ain't to be taken as such a private affair, no sir. Everything you post on the internet, it's there for the world to see. It's like the wind, blowing where it may. And if the school officials should happen to stumble upon it, well, that's just the way it is.\n\nJust like if you're posting about such things as drinking or smoking or what have you, you're asking for it. It's a public thing, and the school has a responsibility to ensure it's a safe place for all. If it's something that's gonna keep the kids safe, then by all means, they should be checking.\n\nBut if they're just going to snoop around, that's a different story. That's like sticking your nose where it ain't wanted. But if it's for the safety of the school, then I reckon it's all right.\n\nIt's a bit like when you're at the water's edge, and you see something there that might be harmful. You check it out, you see if it's safe. If it's not, you warn the others. That's what they're doing with these here internet things, checking if there's something harmful floating about.\n\nNow, I ain't one to be surprised about how careless folks can be. It's like I once told a teacher of mine, \"If you post something online, it's like you're painting it on the side of a building. You can't take it down, not once it's seen.\" And if a person's gotta go to college, they'd best remember that. They're gonna be judged on what they've done and said before, and it's gonna stay with 'em. That's just the way it is.\n\nI mean, if something's leading to a safer place for the students, then fine, check it out. But if it's just for catching folks in trouble, that's a different matter. That's like hunting a man just for the sport of it. Not right, not at all.\n\nAnd I say this: If parents drop off their kids at school, they expect a place of safety. And the school officials are just doing their job, making sure that place is safe. It's like the drills we used to do, back in high school. They were for the safety of all. And that's what they're doing here, making sure nothing bad happens. Like that tragic business at Columbine. That could have been prevented with just a bit of looking out.\n\nSo that's all I've got to say. That's all I can figure on.",
            "Ah, the war. A wretched affair, it was. At first, I was all for it, you see. The specter of nine-eleven still lingered heavy, and I thought, perhaps, we should repay them in kind. But now, I'm not so sure. I reckon we were blinded by emotion, by the desire for vengeance. We stormed their lands, unprepared, unplanned. A fool's errand, it was.\n\nI do believe the people there, they're caught in a cycle of violence, of chaos. They can't seem to turn it off, can't turn it toward anything else but each other. And we, we're just a distraction. A foreign force, trying to impose order on a land that's already been torn asunder. It's futile, I tell you. Like trying to tame a wild beast, you can only do so much before it turns on you.\n\nWe went in there seeking revenge, and we got it. But at what cost? The people there, they're not like us. Their war is not our war. They fight for different reasons, with different rules. And in the end, they'll be just as they were before we arrived. We can't change that.\n\nPresident Bush, he was a man driven by emotion, by the desire to do something, anything. And the people, they wanted action. But it was a hasty decision, a decision made in the heat of the moment. We didn't have a plan, a strategy. We were like children with a toy, playing at war. And look where it's gotten us.\n\nNow, I don't know. I don't know if we've made any progress. I see the rebuilding, but it's like trying to repair a house with a leaking roof. You can patch it up, but it'll still rain inside. We can't stay there forever, and once we leave, what then? Another cycle of violence, of chaos. It's a vicious circle, and we're just a part of it.\n\nBut enough of this. I've said my piece. The war, it's a mistake. A mistake we're all paying for."
