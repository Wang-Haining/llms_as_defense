            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the cold expanse of time, the Catholic Church, a colossus in the landscape of human history, stands as a citadel of ancient creeds and dogmas. Yet, it finds itself in a state of flux, its once unyielding walls crumbling under the relentless onslaught of modern thought. The echo of its former might fades as it grapples with the shifting tides of societal norms and moral vistas, a struggle as haunting as the eerie silence of a desolate plain. The church's stance on matters such as the sanctity of marriage and the sacredness of life, rooted in the hallowed texts of centuries past, has become a beacon of resistance in an era where the winds of change carry the scent of heresy. The once unquestioned authority of its teachings now finds itself challenged by the voices of those who seek to carve new paths in the name of progress and understanding. The church's refusal to bend to the will of the times, to adapt to the shifting sands of societal mores, has left it a relic of a bygone era, a monument to rigidity in a world of fluidity. The shadows cast by its unyielding stance on issues such as abortion and the sanctity of marriage grow longer, and the faithful, like lost souls wandering in the night, find no solace in the darkness. The church's fortress walls, once a bastion of strength and resolve, now echo with the hollow whispers of dissent, a testament to the changing tides of time and the relentless march of history.",
            "Well, let me see now. Me, I ain't got no quarrel with the notion of gay marriage. I mean, if it ain't a choice, then it just ain't a choice. You're born that way, or you ain't. I reckon it's like being born with a particular color of eyes, or the shape of your nose. You can't really choose that, can you? So why in the hell should gay folks be held accountable for their orientation? It ain't right, is it, to say a man and a woman can tie the knot, but two people of the same sex can't?\n\nNow, I ain't given it much thought, mind you, but it feels like they don't have a choice in the matter, just like I didn't choose to be straight. If you're born gay, you're gay. And I don't think they should be punished for that. It's not like it's a conscious decision they made, like stepping into a saloon on a Saturday night.\n\nI reckon it's a whole different story when the federal government gets involved. It's not like it's a matter of national security, or some moral concern that's any of their business. It's just plain wrong to interject in people's lives like that. They ain't doing nothing to harm anyone but themselves, and that's their right. It's who they are, and that ain't something that should be punished. It's like trying to change the course of a river.\n\nSo, I say, let 'em be. It's not our place to judge or to interfere. They ain't hurtin' nobody but themselves, and that's all that matters.",
            "I reckon it's high time we legalize gay marriage. Now, I ain't got much of a reason not to, and I'll tell you why. A lot of folks think that homosexual couples pose some sort of threat to the traditional family, but that's just pure nonsense. It's like comparing apples to oranges, plain and simple. It ain't the same thing at all. There's too many different aspects and factors to it. It's just two sides of the same coin, in a way. Heads won't ever be tails, but they're the same coin nonetheless.\n\nNow, let me tell you, there's plenty of civil rights that come along with it. Property taxes, healthcare, all that. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't even be in the room with you when you're sick, can't visit you. That's just silly, if you'll spend the rest of your life with someone. And there's plenty of scientific studies that show as much. Homosexual couples, they're just as successful, just as happy in their relationships as heterosexual couples.\n\nPeople, they get hung up on it, is all. They think that homosexuals are asking to get married in the church, but they ain't. They're just asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document from the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then what's the problem? I can't figure it out. Catholics and their religious beliefs, they're one thing, but that shouldn't have any bearing on the law. If you're allowing someone a civil union, why not give them a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal. They're just the same in many ways, the type of relationship roles and all that. And people, they worry about adoption, about the community, about how a gay couple will affect it. But honestly, it's the same as with heterosexual couples. Parenting skills are the same, personality choices are the same. It's about love and commitment, and that's it.\n\nNow, I reckon the federal government should be involved in this. Make gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should be the opposite. But President Bush, he's got his own strong views on it, and I ain't sure about that. He's got his views on abortion and stem cell research too, and I think most of the reasons he's against it are moral reasons. Morality, it's not something that's black and white, and to go along with one group's morality while ignoring the rest is just plain unethical. It's hypocritical of the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage, considering the recent controversy over the pledge of allegiance.\n\nNow, there's plenty of folks who are anti-gay, anti-gay marriage because they think gay folks are somehow damaged. But that's not a good reason. The American Psychological Association put out a memo about it, and they've done studies and all. If folks would listen to institutions that actually did the research instead of their neighbors and their friends, maybe the world would make more sense.",
            "Now, listen close, if you're gonna be asking me about this here situation, I'll tell you straight, I work in a hospital pharmacy, summer's my season. You see, just 'cause something's illegal don't make it a poison. I'm saying, we use illegal drugs in the pharmacy, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, the list goes on. They're controlled, sure, but they're also beneficial. Why, then, do we deny that same benefit to marijuana, simply 'cause it's got a taboo label?\n\nNow, I ain't saying it's the same as alcohol. Alcohol, it's a slippery slope, but marijuana, it's not that bad. It won't lead you down the same dark path as heroin or cocaine. But people, they see it as this terrible thing, a monster. Take away that stigma, and people might just use it responsibly.\n\nGradual, that's the key. Not all at once, like some kind of plague. But remove that taboo, and who knows? Maybe we can integrate it, let it be legal, but not right off the bat. People need time to learn, to understand, to see it for what it is. A medicine, maybe, if not a vice.",
            "Well, I reckon the church has seen a fair amount of change in these here modern times. It ain't near as stern as it used to be, if you ask me. When I was just a young'un, I'd dress up in my Sunday best, with a cute little dress, matching shoes, and even a purse to match. We'd all meet up at private school on weekends, a right proper sight to behold. But as the years have passed, things have become a mite more casual. Now they've got these teenager masses, all cut down to just thirty minutes. And the folks coming in attire that'd make you think they just stepped off the beach. It's a sight to see, all right.\n\nAs for the politics and whatnot, I'm not one to meddle in such matters. But I reckon the church's done its best, all things considered. I've seen the accusations against priests, and it's a sorry state of affairs. But I don't believe letting women be priests or allowing them to marry would've made a lick of difference. There's men who are married and still find themselves drawn to young'uns. It's in their nature, I reckon, not something that can be changed by a wedding ring. They choose this path of their own volition, and if they can't satisfy their calling in this faith, maybe they should seek elsewhere.\n\nNow, about the pedophilia, I reckon it's more to do with genetics than anything else. You can't hide that away with a marriage, no sir. It's a sorry business, but I don't believe the church could've done much to prevent it, not if they were unaware. But if they knew and tried to hush it up, well, that's another matter entirely. I reckon that's where the blame lies. But all in all, I ain't got much more to say on the matter.",
            "In the wake of September's dark visitation, I found myself initially swayed by the notion, yet it soon became apparent that we were adrift in a tide of deceit. The Bush regime, like a carrion crow, darted upon the carcass of the twin towers, seizing the moment to hawk its falsehoods - Osama's shadow dancing with the specter of Saddam's supposed WMD. The truth, however, was as evasive as the wind through the desert sands.\n\nIndeed, the administration's lies have left a bitter taste upon my tongue, an acrid reminder of their contempt for the Constitution. Powell, the former secretary, now admits to the UN's stage his evidence was but a shadow play, his words echoing hollow in the chamber of deceit he once graced. Malfeasance, he calls it, an impeachable stain upon their souls.\n\nThe Iraq War, a specter born of vengeance, a fever dream of oil and power. The elder Bush, his son's avenging angel, sought to quench the thirst of empire with the blood of the Middle East. Yet, the sands of time have not been kind to our cause. The present, a landscape of chaos and division, the future a uncertain horizon.\n\nThe Bush administration's error, a calamity of their own making. To withdraw now would be to abandon the Iraqis to their fate, a fate of civil war and attrition. The alternative, a coalition of the region's nations, a band of wolves howling at the moon. Their sovereignty, a tenuous thing, a veil for the wind to rend.\n\nThe Parliament, a house of cards, the Prime Minister, a puppet on its string, the radical elements, a hydra of fractious voices. The political process, a storm of factions, a whirlwind of discord. None of this is polite conversation, no, it is the honest truth, the bitter pill we must swallow.",
            "Now, listen here, I ain't got no use for fancy words or big statements. The Iraq war, it's a mess. It wasn't declared, and I reckon it shouldn't have been. We went in, we didn't know why, and we ain't got a clue what's going on now. It's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole. We think we can fix their democracy, make it all American-like, but that ain't how it works. It's like trying to tame a wild beast. We can't just march in and say, \"This here's how you should live.\" It's not our place, and it ain't gonna end well. The families of the soldiers, the folks over there, they're caught in the middle. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. If we stay, we're overstepping, trying to mold them into a nation they don't want to be. And if we leave, it's like we abandoned them. I reckon it's a never-ending cycle. Years and years of strife, of destruction. It's a no-win situation, and I ain't got no solution. That's all I've got to say about it.",
            "In the heart of this matter, I don't believe it to be just to legalize or for a state to declare it legal. The constitution, as clear as the night sky, states the separation of church and state. It is a sacred boundary, a dividing line between what is holy and what is not. To encroach upon this, to try and wield power over it, would be to spit in the face of what is written in stone. The churches, in their divine wisdom, must decide such matters, not the government. The president's push for an amendment, driven by his Catholic convictions, is nothing more than a preference for one faith over every other. This amendment would be a restriction, a shackle on the people, a contradiction of the very principles our constitution stands for. I see no reason for the government to involve itself in this issue, no economic benefit, no societal gain. It is a matter for the churches to decide, not for men in power. This is my belief, and I stand by it.",
            "The war in Iraq, it sets me a-thinking. From the get-go, I reckon the government wasn't entirely forthcoming with the people. They played on the grief and anger of the American folk, linking Iraq to the terrorist acts of September 11th, when, truth be told, there was little connection. They stirred up the emotions, and before you knew it, we were striking Iraq. I, myself, am not one for war, especially not a preemptive one. It seemed a repeat of old mistakes, like Vietnam, and the government should've learned from that.\n\nThe soldiers, they bled and died, and the government removed the Iraqi regime without a plan for what would follow. They tried to plant a democracy, but it was a long and arduous task. The government should've known it wouldn't be a swift victory, like it wasn't in Vietnam. You can't fight a war on citizens, not an army. The government wasn't ready for what came after. We're still there, nearly a decade later, still trying to train their forces, and it's a long process.\n\nI ain't saying we shouldn't have gone to war, but if we were to, we should've planned for every eventuality. The government, they weren't prepared, and they misled the people, making it seem like a quick and easy task. It was a naive belief, thinking it would be quick. Democracy takes time, and it was a long struggle even for us. The government should've known.\n\nIn the presidential election of 2004, I was torn. I reckon I'd have voted for President Bush to let him finish what he started. But now, how can we abandon those we've taken from their home and way of life? Yet, there's the question of American lives, how many is too many? Why just Iraq? It's all about oil, I reckon. We're not invading North Korea, we know they have weapons. It's all about the resources.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, but I doubt it. The war in Iraq is a hard decision, a difficult one, and I hope it's the right one.",
            "In the quiet of my thoughts, I find myself drawn to the idea of gay marriage. It has always been so, a personal preference, a matter of the heart and mind. It's a choice that's as natural as rain in the desert, a biological inclination, not some sociological whim. To deny such a fundamental aspect of one's being, to strip it of rights, is to commit an act of cruelty. It's a dark echo of the past, a time when men burned books and women were shackled to their places. We have come far, yet still, there are those who would have us turn back.\n\nI've seen it in my own neighborhood, where two or three couples live openly, their love as visible as the sun at noon. They walk their dogs, as any family would, and yet, because of the law, they are not allowed to call each other husband and wife. It's a absurdity, a mockery of the institution it claims to protect. It's like Bush trying to play God, interpreting the word 'marriage' to fit into his own Bible belt.\n\nThe truth is, it's a chemical thing in the brain, a predisposition, like the color of one's eyes. It's not something that can be taught or unlearned. It's as natural as the sun rising in the east. And yet, it's not just about the couple, but the family they create, the life they build. It's a private matter, a personal one, not something to be paraded in the public square.\n\nI've read about it, heard it from the mouths of doctors and scientists, seen it in the pages of newspapers and on the screens of televisions. It's not a choice, not a lifestyle, but a reality, as real as the earth beneath our feet. And yet, there are those who would have us believe otherwise, who would have us turn away from the truth.\n\nNo, I won't. I won't turn away from the truth, won't deny the reality of what I see, of what I feel. I won't be silent while others are denied their rights, their dignity. For I am not just a respecter of marriage, but a believer in equality, in the right of every individual to pursue their happiness, to love whom they choose, to live their lives as they see fit.",
            "Ah, the internet. A vast and uncharted territory, a wilderness of sorts, where words and actions find their way to the ears and eyes of all. When you cast your thoughts or deeds into this digital frontier, you cannot neatly fence them off nor expect them to remain unscathed. Nay, they are shared, seen, and heard by the world at large.\n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I've seen firsthand the consequences of careless words in this digital expanse. You see, the internet is not a place of isolation, but a public forum, a virtual town square. Whatever you post, it becomes a part of your reputation, a thread in the tapestry of your character. And if you spew tales of violence or destruction, as some might say, \"Here be dragons,\" someone is bound to take notice.\n\nConsider the time at our school, when a whisper became a storm. A word, overheard and amplified, reached the school's ears. The administration could not ignore it, for their duty is to protect and guide. They could not let it lie, lest they be held accountable if a calamity befell. Yet, how to discern the jest from the serious? Some fool around, post without thought, their words taken as truth, while others mean well in their jest, but their words find no humor in the eyes of others.\n\nThe internet, it seems, has no respect for privacy. If you wish to keep something hidden, do not put it out there for all to see. And if you cry foul when others see what you've made public, you are akin to the man who builds a fire in the forest and complains when it scorches his house.\n\nThe school officials, they tread a fine line. They must be vigilant, for their duty is to safeguard, not to invade. But when danger is brought to their attention, they must act, lest they be found negligent. And while I do not advocate for snooping into the private lives of students, if a whisper of danger reaches their ears, they must listen. For to ignore a warning is to risk a tragedy.\n\nAnd when it comes to friendships and connections, I, too, maintain a distance. I would not befriend my residents on such platforms, for then I would be privy to their private lives, their foibles and triumphs. It is not my place to judge, nor to be a part of their personal lives. But if a whisper of danger reaches my ears, then I, too, must act, for the safety of all is at stake.\n\nSo, tread lightly, dear student, in this digital wilderness. For once you post, you cannot unpost, and the words you speak may echo long after you've moved on. Keep your thoughts and actions private, lest they become public, and remember, in this vast expanse of the internet, there is no such thing as complete privacy.",
            "In the yawning maw of this war, I have come to feel a rising unease, a gnawing sensation that the purpose has been forgotten. It began with a noble aim, a quest to bring democracy to a land choked under the despot's yoke. Yet, the spirit of that purpose has since withered, like the sun-kissed plains of our troops' march. Now, we fight not for the betterment of another's soul, but to prove ourselves a force to be reckoned with. The initial spark that ignited this conflict was a tale of family feuds and old grudges, a tangled web that entangled us in this endless dance of death and destruction.\n\nThe first few months were enough to send a clear message, to let the world know who we were. But the war has stretched on, a hungry beast fed by the blood of young men and the whispers of lost causes. We have long since lost our path, our purpose diluted like ink in water. We fight not for the freedom of others, but for the sake of fighting itself, a spectacle to prove our might. The time has come for us to step back, to let the locals fend for themselves, to tend to our own wounds and heal our own land.\n\nWe have spent untold billions, not on the well-being of our own citizens, but on the ashes of a foreign land. We have forgotten the plight of our own, the poverty and despair that festers within our own borders. This war, once a beacon of hope, has become a drain on our resources, a leech sucking the life from our nation. We must turn our gaze inward, to the roads that need mending, to the schools that cry out for attention, to the healthcare that is a privilege, not a right.\n\nThe war has gone on long enough. It is time to stop, to let the dust settle, to tend to our own wounds and heal our own land. For too long, we have been the torturer and the tortured, the executioner and the executed, the warrior and the war. It is time to turn away from this endless war, to focus on the needs of our own people, to let the world know that our strength lies not in distant battles, but in the unity and prosperity of our own land.",
            "Can I inquire, sir, about a matter that troubles my mind? I heard of an incident wherein a life was spared, yet I am uncertain of the circumstances.\n\nIt seems that some individual chanced upon a profile, obscured by the veil of the internet. Is this not an intrusion upon the sanctity of one's privacy? On sites such as Myspace, we must understand, once we post our information, it is exposed to the world.\n\nI am told that on Myspace, one must first be accepted as a 'friend' to view another's profile. Yet, this acceptance implies a tacit consent, does it not? If we share our lives on the internet, we must accept that many will gaze upon our private moments.\n\nIt is a delicate balance, this dance with the web. We may not have the time nor the resources to monitor every profile of every student in our school. But to target certain students, to delve into their private lives, is it not an act of discrimination? I wonder, what situation would justify such intrusion?\n\nI, myself, maintain a Facebook account. The thought of unseen eyes peering into my existence disturbs me. I have witnessed, on the screen, a man extracting information from a girl's profile with ease. Yet, I too have encountered strangers who seem to know me well, as if they have delved into my soul. It is a precarious situation, this digital world.\n\nMy roommate shared a tale of her high school days, where students were forbidden from using Myspace. I cannot fathom the power of high school officials to dictate such rules. Is this not an encroachment upon our privacy?",
            "Upshot of our discourse, son, is that I ain't one to beat the drum for the Iraq War. How could I be? It's been a tumbleweed of a mess, like a bloody sandstorm in the desert. From before we set foot in the godforsaken place to now, it's been a carpetbaggin' of errors and missteps. Just speakin' of it makes my teeth grind like a stone mill. Who in their right mind thought it a good idea to storm into Saddam's den? The world, for the most part, was screaming no, but those in charge, they just hummed along, deaf to the pleas and the evidence of the wind. I'm not one to join the chorus of the choir, but it's plain as day that the Iraqis, the folks we claimed to be helpin', want us to pack up and leave. Even the soldiers, the boots on the ground, they ain't fools. They see the futility, the quicksand we're sinkin' into. The administration, well, they're like a drunkard on a barstool, stuck in their delusions, clingin' to a hope that's as thin as a mosque's curtain. They talk about the problems that'll arise if we leave, but I ask you, what problems won't? This ain't about bein' the good guys, but about bein' the ones who make a clean getaway. It's a tightrope act, and we're danglin' from a frayin' thread.",
            "I reckon gender discrimination still lingers in these here United States. It ain't just women, mind you. No, sir. It's a matter of the specific trade you're in.\n\nTake the workplace, for instance. There's this... glass ceiling, they call it. It's like society's got a hard time seeing a woman above them. It's been that way for too long. You see a woman with all the qualifications for a job, but the board won't have her. It ain't right, that's for sure.\n\nNow, it's not just women either. Men have their own battles. Like in fashion, for example. People won't take 'em seriously, you know? They think, \"Well, how can a man know anything about fashion when it's for women?\" It's a strange sight, that's sure. But it's changing, slow as molasses, but it's changing.\n\nSociety's got to be reminded, you see. You can't just shove it in their faces. You gotta show 'em the good qualities. Like those men who stay at home to raise the kids. People look down on that, but it's changing, bit by bit.\n\nIt ain't easy, changing minds. We've come a long way, sure, but change takes time. It's like turning a ship. You can't just steer it straight at a cliff and expect it to turn. No, sir. You gotta nudge it, gently, towards the right path.\n\nSame goes for where you're from. If you're from a farm and you ain't got the best grammar, but you're smart as a whip, people might look down on you. They might think you ain't no CEO material. But they'd be wrong. It's like that old saying goes, \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\"\n\nSo, yeah, it's complicated. But we're getting there. Slow and steady, we're winning the race.",
            "In the quiet of my thoughts, I have discerned that what some call legalization was not the path we've trod, but rather decriminalization. A shift from the cold embrace of criminal law to a ticket, a merely inconvenient citation, akin to a speeding infraction. The weight of a cannabis charge, once a heavy burden, has been lifted, yet the specter of future ramifications lingers.\n\nThe financial toll of arresting, housing, and trying those accused is a burden many municipalities find too costly. The stark realization that such expenditure could fund public education, care for the elderly, and feed the destitute is a compelling argument. Yet, not all communities are so swayed, their moral compass still anchored against the indulgence of cannabis.\n\nDenver, a city of liberal leanings, has embraced this path, finding solace in the financial liberation it affords. The streets may not be filled with open embrace of marijuana, but the financial burden lifted has allowed for greater good to be achieved.\n\nThe question of open sale and use remains a touchy subject. The thought of cannabis being as prevalent as cigarettes is...well, unsettling. Our society still views it as taboo in many contexts, and I harbor concern that its open embrace would be met with discomfort.\n\nThe effects of alcohol and marijuana on the human mind and body are well-documented, and I would not generalize their impacts. Some react with restraint, others with abandon, and still others with moderation. The path of each is as varied as the substance itself.\n\nIn the end, I find myself at a crossroads, torn between the financial liberation and the societal discomfort. The question, as it always has been, is not one of morality, but of practicality.",
            "I would say no, for a multitude of reasons. The Catholic Church, in its prolonged tenure, has indeed been steadfast in its traditions, a virtue in its own right, yet it also needs to be flexible, like a river carving its path through the land. A river cannot continue to flow if it does not change course, adapt to the land, and merge with other waters.\n\nThe Church, like a river, has its bounds and its rituals. It is not uncommon for its adherents to be rigorous in their attendance, adhering to age-old practices. Yet, this adherence is not without its criticisms. One common complaint is the Church's intolerance towards those who do not strictly follow its doctrine, be they Catholics who falter or adherents of other religions. My own parents' experience, wherein my mother's Catholicism and my father's Episcopalianism prevented their union in the Church, is but one such example.\n\nThe Church preaches love and acceptance, yet it has been accused of hypocrisy in its failure to truly embrace those who do not fit its mold. This hypocrisy is not confined to its doctrine, but also in its practice, which often seems outdated and rigid. The Church continues to cling to these traditions, despite their archaic nature.\n\nThe matter of priests is another contentious one. I believe it would be beneficial for the Church to allow its clergy to marry, but I do not think it would necessarily deter pedophilic behavior among them. After all, the root of such atrocities lies not in marital status, but in the perpetrator's character. A predator, be they married or celibate, would likely act upon their impulses regardless of their marital status. The solution to such issues does not lie in marital status, but in the hearts and minds of the individuals themselves.",
            "Well, I ain't sure yet. The matter's got me tied in knots like a calf in a brier patch. It's like tryin' to split the difference between church and state, and what makes a marriage. It's a tricky business, and I reckon everybody's got their own take. I'm thinkin' maybe we should look at civil unions. Marriage, it's a sacred thing, sure, but the government, they ain't got no business in it. It's between two souls, and that's all there is to it. If the states can agree on something, they ought to make it law. But amendin' the Constitution? That's like tryin' to fix a leak with a hammer. Ain't no way. It's just not that important. So, no, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a household where the word of the Lord held sway, so the matter of homosexuality has always been a land of twilight for me. I have friends who walk that path, and it is a complex terrain to navigate. I do not harbor affection for the lifestyle, yet I believe it should find its place beneath the banner of legality, not as a matter of national debate but as a decision left to each state's discretion.\n\nSome states are of a democratic bent, others tilt republican, and each leans towards their own beliefs on this matter. To live in a state is to align oneself with its values, and I do not think one should question the decisions of their chosen home. I believe homosexuals should be granted the same opportunities as those who walk the well-trodden path of heterosexuality. It is a right that should be granted at the whim of each state, not dictated from on high.\n\nI find no compelling reason for the president, be he Bush or another, to impose his will upon the whole of this nation. He does not dwell in every state, nor should he have the authority to determine their course. The president's tenure is fleeting, and the wind of politics will shift with his departure. If a new president should lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be a matter of back and forth, a seesaw of policy that benefits no one save the lobbyists and their cronies.\n\nI stand firm in my belief that these matters should be left to the judgment of each individual state, for they are the ones who will bear the weight of their decisions. It is not the president's place to determine the fate of every state, nor should he be granted such power. The buck stops with the people, and it should be they who decide their own path.",
            "I reckon I don't at all.\nLet me consider this. I've been told that Myspace is akin to a public bulletin, there for all to see.\nIf one posts on the internet, be it for the public eye or just for others to read, one has to understand that it may reach beyond just the intended audience.\nIn my mind, if school officials happen upon such a post, they've a right to see it, no matter who's doing it or where from. They could've accessed it from their homes, after all.\nThough, if it's to prevent a school shooting, well, I say that's a responsibility they're simply fulfilling.\nNow, if they're prowling the internet just to catch students in the act, that's an invasion of privacy, plain and simple.\nBut if it's to make the school safer, then I can't fault them.\nIt's a public thing, and if a student posts something and doesn't expect to get into trouble, they're being more naive than I'd like.\nI've always been careful with what I put out there, even through emails. I fear something will come back to haunt me, and once it's on the internet, it's there to stay.\nI don't see how that's an invasion of privacy, though. They're just doing what they're supposed to be doing.\nIf they see something that could lead to a safer school environment, then I can't fault them. That's their responsibility, after all.\nSame goes for other officials like the police. Parents send their kids to school expecting a safe environment. School officials are just doing their part to ensure that.\nI've talked to a teacher about this, and they told me about all the drills they have in case of terrorist attacks. It's all about safety, you see.\nAnd that's exactly what the school officials were doing here. They were making the school a safer place. Preventing something like Columbine or worse.\nThat's all I can think to add.",
            "In the bloodied aftermath of September eleventh, I was a voice crying out for vengeance. The world had been set ablaze, and I yearned for retribution. I was all for the charge into the heart of darkness, a crusade to answer in kind the fire that had consumed our shores.\n\nYet, as the sands of time turned, I found myself stirred by doubt. The war, it seemed, was born of emotion, a blaze fueled by grief and anger. We rushed in unprepared, like a man charged at the gates of hell with no more than a flaming torch and a prayer.\n\nThe people of the land, they were like beasts of prey, caught in a ceaseless dance of violence. They fought one another, and we, too, were caught in their whirlwind. It became clear that their war was something other than our own. They did not seek to build, but to destroy, to chase us from their land.\n\nIn retrospect, we were drunk on the intoxicating brew of patriotism and fear. We charged in, not with a plan, but with a prayer. The road to hell, it seems, is paved with good intentions, and we had set our course for a destination we barely understood.\n\nThe president, he was a man of the people, and the people, they clamored for blood. He, too, was caught in the current, swept along by the tide of public opinion. Iraq, it seemed, was the scapegoat, the sacrifice to appease the gods of anger and fear.\n\nYet, even then, I saw the folly of our course. We were not the architects of order, but the spark of chaos. We sought to rebuild, yet we could not even agree on the path to order. Our divisions were as vast as the deserts we sought to tame.\n\nNow, I see the futility of our endeavor. We are like a drunken man stumbling in the dark, grasping for a door that is not there. The land is a wound that will not heal, a beast that will not be tamed. We are the intruders, the interlopers, and our presence is a cancer that will only harm the land.\n\nThe war, it seems, is a cycle, a never-ending dance of violence and death. We can withdraw, and the dance will continue, but the wound will not heal. We can stay, and the wound will fester, but the dance will not end.\n\nWe are the outsiders, the foreigners, and our presence is a poison. We can withdraw, and the poison will dissipate. Or we can stay, and the poison will continue to spread, infecting all who come near.\n\nI do not know if there is a right answer, only that we must find a way to break the cycle. The land, it seems, will not be ours to claim, but we can choose to leave, to allow it to heal in its own way."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the cold expanse of time, the Catholic Church, a colossus in the landscape of human history, stands as a citadel of ancient creeds and dogmas. Yet, it finds itself in a state of flux, its once unyielding walls crumbling under the relentless onslaught of modern thought. The echo of its former might fades as it grapples with the shifting tides of societal norms and moral vistas, a struggle as haunting as the eerie silence of a desolate plain. The church's stance on matters such as the sanctity of marriage and the sacredness of life, rooted in the hallowed texts of centuries past, has become a beacon of resistance in an era where the winds of change carry the scent of heresy. The once unquestioned authority of its teachings now finds itself challenged by the voices of those who seek to carve new paths in the name of progress and understanding. The church's refusal to bend to the will of the times, to adapt to the shifting sands of societal mores, has left it a relic of a bygone era, a monument to rigidity in a world of fluidity. The shadows cast by its unyielding stance on issues such as abortion and the sanctity of marriage grow longer, and the faithful, like lost souls wandering in the night, find no solace in the darkness. The church's fortress walls, once a bastion of strength and resolve, now echo with the hollow whispers of dissent, a testament to the changing tides of time and the relentless march of history.",
            "Well, let me see now. Me, I ain't got no quarrel with the notion of gay marriage. I mean, if it ain't a choice, then it just ain't a choice. You're born that way, or you ain't. I reckon it's like being born with a particular color of eyes, or the shape of your nose. You can't really choose that, can you? So why in the hell should gay folks be held accountable for their orientation? It ain't right, is it, to say a man and a woman can tie the knot, but two people of the same sex can't?\n\nNow, I ain't given it much thought, mind you, but it feels like they don't have a choice in the matter, just like I didn't choose to be straight. If you're born gay, you're gay. And I don't think they should be punished for that. It's not like it's a conscious decision they made, like stepping into a saloon on a Saturday night.\n\nI reckon it's a whole different story when the federal government gets involved. It's not like it's a matter of national security, or some moral concern that's any of their business. It's just plain wrong to interject in people's lives like that. They ain't doing nothing to harm anyone but themselves, and that's their right. It's who they are, and that ain't something that should be punished. It's like trying to change the course of a river.\n\nSo, I say, let 'em be. It's not our place to judge or to interfere. They ain't hurtin' nobody but themselves, and that's all that matters.",
            "I reckon it's high time we legalize gay marriage. Now, I ain't got much of a reason not to, and I'll tell you why. A lot of folks think that homosexual couples pose some sort of threat to the traditional family, but that's just pure nonsense. It's like comparing apples to oranges, plain and simple. It ain't the same thing at all. There's too many different aspects and factors to it. It's just two sides of the same coin, in a way. Heads won't ever be tails, but they're the same coin nonetheless.\n\nNow, let me tell you, there's plenty of civil rights that come along with it. Property taxes, healthcare, all that. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't even be in the room with you when you're sick, can't visit you. That's just silly, if you'll spend the rest of your life with someone. And there's plenty of scientific studies that show as much. Homosexual couples, they're just as successful, just as happy in their relationships as heterosexual couples.\n\nPeople, they get hung up on it, is all. They think that homosexuals are asking to get married in the church, but they ain't. They're just asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document from the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then what's the problem? I can't figure it out. Catholics and their religious beliefs, they're one thing, but that shouldn't have any bearing on the law. If you're allowing someone a civil union, why not give them a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal. They're just the same in many ways, the type of relationship roles and all that. And people, they worry about adoption, about the community, about how a gay couple will affect it. But honestly, it's the same as with heterosexual couples. Parenting skills are the same, personality choices are the same. It's about love and commitment, and that's it.\n\nNow, I reckon the federal government should be involved in this. Make gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should be the opposite. But President Bush, he's got his own strong views on it, and I ain't sure about that. He's got his views on abortion and stem cell research too, and I think most of the reasons he's against it are moral reasons. Morality, it's not something that's black and white, and to go along with one group's morality while ignoring the rest is just plain unethical. It's hypocritical of the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage, considering the recent controversy over the pledge of allegiance.\n\nNow, there's plenty of folks who are anti-gay, anti-gay marriage because they think gay folks are somehow damaged. But that's not a good reason. The American Psychological Association put out a memo about it, and they've done studies and all. If folks would listen to institutions that actually did the research instead of their neighbors and their friends, maybe the world would make more sense.",
            "Now, listen close, if you're gonna be asking me about this here situation, I'll tell you straight, I work in a hospital pharmacy, summer's my season. You see, just 'cause something's illegal don't make it a poison. I'm saying, we use illegal drugs in the pharmacy, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, the list goes on. They're controlled, sure, but they're also beneficial. Why, then, do we deny that same benefit to marijuana, simply 'cause it's got a taboo label?\n\nNow, I ain't saying it's the same as alcohol. Alcohol, it's a slippery slope, but marijuana, it's not that bad. It won't lead you down the same dark path as heroin or cocaine. But people, they see it as this terrible thing, a monster. Take away that stigma, and people might just use it responsibly.\n\nGradual, that's the key. Not all at once, like some kind of plague. But remove that taboo, and who knows? Maybe we can integrate it, let it be legal, but not right off the bat. People need time to learn, to understand, to see it for what it is. A medicine, maybe, if not a vice.",
            "Well, I reckon the church has seen a fair amount of change in these here modern times. It ain't near as stern as it used to be, if you ask me. When I was just a young'un, I'd dress up in my Sunday best, with a cute little dress, matching shoes, and even a purse to match. We'd all meet up at private school on weekends, a right proper sight to behold. But as the years have passed, things have become a mite more casual. Now they've got these teenager masses, all cut down to just thirty minutes. And the folks coming in attire that'd make you think they just stepped off the beach. It's a sight to see, all right.\n\nAs for the politics and whatnot, I'm not one to meddle in such matters. But I reckon the church's done its best, all things considered. I've seen the accusations against priests, and it's a sorry state of affairs. But I don't believe letting women be priests or allowing them to marry would've made a lick of difference. There's men who are married and still find themselves drawn to young'uns. It's in their nature, I reckon, not something that can be changed by a wedding ring. They choose this path of their own volition, and if they can't satisfy their calling in this faith, maybe they should seek elsewhere.\n\nNow, about the pedophilia, I reckon it's more to do with genetics than anything else. You can't hide that away with a marriage, no sir. It's a sorry business, but I don't believe the church could've done much to prevent it, not if they were unaware. But if they knew and tried to hush it up, well, that's another matter entirely. I reckon that's where the blame lies. But all in all, I ain't got much more to say on the matter.",
            "In the wake of September's dark visitation, I found myself initially swayed by the notion, yet it soon became apparent that we were adrift in a tide of deceit. The Bush regime, like a carrion crow, darted upon the carcass of the twin towers, seizing the moment to hawk its falsehoods - Osama's shadow dancing with the specter of Saddam's supposed WMD. The truth, however, was as evasive as the wind through the desert sands.\n\nIndeed, the administration's lies have left a bitter taste upon my tongue, an acrid reminder of their contempt for the Constitution. Powell, the former secretary, now admits to the UN's stage his evidence was but a shadow play, his words echoing hollow in the chamber of deceit he once graced. Malfeasance, he calls it, an impeachable stain upon their souls.\n\nThe Iraq War, a specter born of vengeance, a fever dream of oil and power. The elder Bush, his son's avenging angel, sought to quench the thirst of empire with the blood of the Middle East. Yet, the sands of time have not been kind to our cause. The present, a landscape of chaos and division, the future a uncertain horizon.\n\nThe Bush administration's error, a calamity of their own making. To withdraw now would be to abandon the Iraqis to their fate, a fate of civil war and attrition. The alternative, a coalition of the region's nations, a band of wolves howling at the moon. Their sovereignty, a tenuous thing, a veil for the wind to rend.\n\nThe Parliament, a house of cards, the Prime Minister, a puppet on its string, the radical elements, a hydra of fractious voices. The political process, a storm of factions, a whirlwind of discord. None of this is polite conversation, no, it is the honest truth, the bitter pill we must swallow.",
            "Now, listen here, I ain't got no use for fancy words or big statements. The Iraq war, it's a mess. It wasn't declared, and I reckon it shouldn't have been. We went in, we didn't know why, and we ain't got a clue what's going on now. It's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole. We think we can fix their democracy, make it all American-like, but that ain't how it works. It's like trying to tame a wild beast. We can't just march in and say, \"This here's how you should live.\" It's not our place, and it ain't gonna end well. The families of the soldiers, the folks over there, they're caught in the middle. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. If we stay, we're overstepping, trying to mold them into a nation they don't want to be. And if we leave, it's like we abandoned them. I reckon it's a never-ending cycle. Years and years of strife, of destruction. It's a no-win situation, and I ain't got no solution. That's all I've got to say about it.",
            "In the heart of this matter, I don't believe it to be just to legalize or for a state to declare it legal. The constitution, as clear as the night sky, states the separation of church and state. It is a sacred boundary, a dividing line between what is holy and what is not. To encroach upon this, to try and wield power over it, would be to spit in the face of what is written in stone. The churches, in their divine wisdom, must decide such matters, not the government. The president's push for an amendment, driven by his Catholic convictions, is nothing more than a preference for one faith over every other. This amendment would be a restriction, a shackle on the people, a contradiction of the very principles our constitution stands for. I see no reason for the government to involve itself in this issue, no economic benefit, no societal gain. It is a matter for the churches to decide, not for men in power. This is my belief, and I stand by it.",
            "The war in Iraq, it sets me a-thinking. From the get-go, I reckon the government wasn't entirely forthcoming with the people. They played on the grief and anger of the American folk, linking Iraq to the terrorist acts of September 11th, when, truth be told, there was little connection. They stirred up the emotions, and before you knew it, we were striking Iraq. I, myself, am not one for war, especially not a preemptive one. It seemed a repeat of old mistakes, like Vietnam, and the government should've learned from that.\n\nThe soldiers, they bled and died, and the government removed the Iraqi regime without a plan for what would follow. They tried to plant a democracy, but it was a long and arduous task. The government should've known it wouldn't be a swift victory, like it wasn't in Vietnam. You can't fight a war on citizens, not an army. The government wasn't ready for what came after. We're still there, nearly a decade later, still trying to train their forces, and it's a long process.\n\nI ain't saying we shouldn't have gone to war, but if we were to, we should've planned for every eventuality. The government, they weren't prepared, and they misled the people, making it seem like a quick and easy task. It was a naive belief, thinking it would be quick. Democracy takes time, and it was a long struggle even for us. The government should've known.\n\nIn the presidential election of 2004, I was torn. I reckon I'd have voted for President Bush to let him finish what he started. But now, how can we abandon those we've taken from their home and way of life? Yet, there's the question of American lives, how many is too many? Why just Iraq? It's all about oil, I reckon. We're not invading North Korea, we know they have weapons. It's all about the resources.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, but I doubt it. The war in Iraq is a hard decision, a difficult one, and I hope it's the right one.",
            "In the quiet of my thoughts, I find myself drawn to the idea of gay marriage. It has always been so, a personal preference, a matter of the heart and mind. It's a choice that's as natural as rain in the desert, a biological inclination, not some sociological whim. To deny such a fundamental aspect of one's being, to strip it of rights, is to commit an act of cruelty. It's a dark echo of the past, a time when men burned books and women were shackled to their places. We have come far, yet still, there are those who would have us turn back.\n\nI've seen it in my own neighborhood, where two or three couples live openly, their love as visible as the sun at noon. They walk their dogs, as any family would, and yet, because of the law, they are not allowed to call each other husband and wife. It's a absurdity, a mockery of the institution it claims to protect. It's like Bush trying to play God, interpreting the word 'marriage' to fit into his own Bible belt.\n\nThe truth is, it's a chemical thing in the brain, a predisposition, like the color of one's eyes. It's not something that can be taught or unlearned. It's as natural as the sun rising in the east. And yet, it's not just about the couple, but the family they create, the life they build. It's a private matter, a personal one, not something to be paraded in the public square.\n\nI've read about it, heard it from the mouths of doctors and scientists, seen it in the pages of newspapers and on the screens of televisions. It's not a choice, not a lifestyle, but a reality, as real as the earth beneath our feet. And yet, there are those who would have us believe otherwise, who would have us turn away from the truth.\n\nNo, I won't. I won't turn away from the truth, won't deny the reality of what I see, of what I feel. I won't be silent while others are denied their rights, their dignity. For I am not just a respecter of marriage, but a believer in equality, in the right of every individual to pursue their happiness, to love whom they choose, to live their lives as they see fit.",
            "Ah, the internet. A vast and uncharted territory, a wilderness of sorts, where words and actions find their way to the ears and eyes of all. When you cast your thoughts or deeds into this digital frontier, you cannot neatly fence them off nor expect them to remain unscathed. Nay, they are shared, seen, and heard by the world at large.\n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I've seen firsthand the consequences of careless words in this digital expanse. You see, the internet is not a place of isolation, but a public forum, a virtual town square. Whatever you post, it becomes a part of your reputation, a thread in the tapestry of your character. And if you spew tales of violence or destruction, as some might say, \"Here be dragons,\" someone is bound to take notice.\n\nConsider the time at our school, when a whisper became a storm. A word, overheard and amplified, reached the school's ears. The administration could not ignore it, for their duty is to protect and guide. They could not let it lie, lest they be held accountable if a calamity befell. Yet, how to discern the jest from the serious? Some fool around, post without thought, their words taken as truth, while others mean well in their jest, but their words find no humor in the eyes of others.\n\nThe internet, it seems, has no respect for privacy. If you wish to keep something hidden, do not put it out there for all to see. And if you cry foul when others see what you've made public, you are akin to the man who builds a fire in the forest and complains when it scorches his house.\n\nThe school officials, they tread a fine line. They must be vigilant, for their duty is to safeguard, not to invade. But when danger is brought to their attention, they must act, lest they be found negligent. And while I do not advocate for snooping into the private lives of students, if a whisper of danger reaches their ears, they must listen. For to ignore a warning is to risk a tragedy.\n\nAnd when it comes to friendships and connections, I, too, maintain a distance. I would not befriend my residents on such platforms, for then I would be privy to their private lives, their foibles and triumphs. It is not my place to judge, nor to be a part of their personal lives. But if a whisper of danger reaches my ears, then I, too, must act, for the safety of all is at stake.\n\nSo, tread lightly, dear student, in this digital wilderness. For once you post, you cannot unpost, and the words you speak may echo long after you've moved on. Keep your thoughts and actions private, lest they become public, and remember, in this vast expanse of the internet, there is no such thing as complete privacy.",
            "In the yawning maw of this war, I have come to feel a rising unease, a gnawing sensation that the purpose has been forgotten. It began with a noble aim, a quest to bring democracy to a land choked under the despot's yoke. Yet, the spirit of that purpose has since withered, like the sun-kissed plains of our troops' march. Now, we fight not for the betterment of another's soul, but to prove ourselves a force to be reckoned with. The initial spark that ignited this conflict was a tale of family feuds and old grudges, a tangled web that entangled us in this endless dance of death and destruction.\n\nThe first few months were enough to send a clear message, to let the world know who we were. But the war has stretched on, a hungry beast fed by the blood of young men and the whispers of lost causes. We have long since lost our path, our purpose diluted like ink in water. We fight not for the freedom of others, but for the sake of fighting itself, a spectacle to prove our might. The time has come for us to step back, to let the locals fend for themselves, to tend to our own wounds and heal our own land.\n\nWe have spent untold billions, not on the well-being of our own citizens, but on the ashes of a foreign land. We have forgotten the plight of our own, the poverty and despair that festers within our own borders. This war, once a beacon of hope, has become a drain on our resources, a leech sucking the life from our nation. We must turn our gaze inward, to the roads that need mending, to the schools that cry out for attention, to the healthcare that is a privilege, not a right.\n\nThe war has gone on long enough. It is time to stop, to let the dust settle, to tend to our own wounds and heal our own land. For too long, we have been the torturer and the tortured, the executioner and the executed, the warrior and the war. It is time to turn away from this endless war, to focus on the needs of our own people, to let the world know that our strength lies not in distant battles, but in the unity and prosperity of our own land.",
            "Can I inquire, sir, about a matter that troubles my mind? I heard of an incident wherein a life was spared, yet I am uncertain of the circumstances.\n\nIt seems that some individual chanced upon a profile, obscured by the veil of the internet. Is this not an intrusion upon the sanctity of one's privacy? On sites such as Myspace, we must understand, once we post our information, it is exposed to the world.\n\nI am told that on Myspace, one must first be accepted as a 'friend' to view another's profile. Yet, this acceptance implies a tacit consent, does it not? If we share our lives on the internet, we must accept that many will gaze upon our private moments.\n\nIt is a delicate balance, this dance with the web. We may not have the time nor the resources to monitor every profile of every student in our school. But to target certain students, to delve into their private lives, is it not an act of discrimination? I wonder, what situation would justify such intrusion?\n\nI, myself, maintain a Facebook account. The thought of unseen eyes peering into my existence disturbs me. I have witnessed, on the screen, a man extracting information from a girl's profile with ease. Yet, I too have encountered strangers who seem to know me well, as if they have delved into my soul. It is a precarious situation, this digital world.\n\nMy roommate shared a tale of her high school days, where students were forbidden from using Myspace. I cannot fathom the power of high school officials to dictate such rules. Is this not an encroachment upon our privacy?",
            "Upshot of our discourse, son, is that I ain't one to beat the drum for the Iraq War. How could I be? It's been a tumbleweed of a mess, like a bloody sandstorm in the desert. From before we set foot in the godforsaken place to now, it's been a carpetbaggin' of errors and missteps. Just speakin' of it makes my teeth grind like a stone mill. Who in their right mind thought it a good idea to storm into Saddam's den? The world, for the most part, was screaming no, but those in charge, they just hummed along, deaf to the pleas and the evidence of the wind. I'm not one to join the chorus of the choir, but it's plain as day that the Iraqis, the folks we claimed to be helpin', want us to pack up and leave. Even the soldiers, the boots on the ground, they ain't fools. They see the futility, the quicksand we're sinkin' into. The administration, well, they're like a drunkard on a barstool, stuck in their delusions, clingin' to a hope that's as thin as a mosque's curtain. They talk about the problems that'll arise if we leave, but I ask you, what problems won't? This ain't about bein' the good guys, but about bein' the ones who make a clean getaway. It's a tightrope act, and we're danglin' from a frayin' thread.",
            "I reckon gender discrimination still lingers in these here United States. It ain't just women, mind you. No, sir. It's a matter of the specific trade you're in.\n\nTake the workplace, for instance. There's this... glass ceiling, they call it. It's like society's got a hard time seeing a woman above them. It's been that way for too long. You see a woman with all the qualifications for a job, but the board won't have her. It ain't right, that's for sure.\n\nNow, it's not just women either. Men have their own battles. Like in fashion, for example. People won't take 'em seriously, you know? They think, \"Well, how can a man know anything about fashion when it's for women?\" It's a strange sight, that's sure. But it's changing, slow as molasses, but it's changing.\n\nSociety's got to be reminded, you see. You can't just shove it in their faces. You gotta show 'em the good qualities. Like those men who stay at home to raise the kids. People look down on that, but it's changing, bit by bit.\n\nIt ain't easy, changing minds. We've come a long way, sure, but change takes time. It's like turning a ship. You can't just steer it straight at a cliff and expect it to turn. No, sir. You gotta nudge it, gently, towards the right path.\n\nSame goes for where you're from. If you're from a farm and you ain't got the best grammar, but you're smart as a whip, people might look down on you. They might think you ain't no CEO material. But they'd be wrong. It's like that old saying goes, \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\"\n\nSo, yeah, it's complicated. But we're getting there. Slow and steady, we're winning the race.",
            "In the quiet of my thoughts, I have discerned that what some call legalization was not the path we've trod, but rather decriminalization. A shift from the cold embrace of criminal law to a ticket, a merely inconvenient citation, akin to a speeding infraction. The weight of a cannabis charge, once a heavy burden, has been lifted, yet the specter of future ramifications lingers.\n\nThe financial toll of arresting, housing, and trying those accused is a burden many municipalities find too costly. The stark realization that such expenditure could fund public education, care for the elderly, and feed the destitute is a compelling argument. Yet, not all communities are so swayed, their moral compass still anchored against the indulgence of cannabis.\n\nDenver, a city of liberal leanings, has embraced this path, finding solace in the financial liberation it affords. The streets may not be filled with open embrace of marijuana, but the financial burden lifted has allowed for greater good to be achieved.\n\nThe question of open sale and use remains a touchy subject. The thought of cannabis being as prevalent as cigarettes is...well, unsettling. Our society still views it as taboo in many contexts, and I harbor concern that its open embrace would be met with discomfort.\n\nThe effects of alcohol and marijuana on the human mind and body are well-documented, and I would not generalize their impacts. Some react with restraint, others with abandon, and still others with moderation. The path of each is as varied as the substance itself.\n\nIn the end, I find myself at a crossroads, torn between the financial liberation and the societal discomfort. The question, as it always has been, is not one of morality, but of practicality.",
            "I would say no, for a multitude of reasons. The Catholic Church, in its prolonged tenure, has indeed been steadfast in its traditions, a virtue in its own right, yet it also needs to be flexible, like a river carving its path through the land. A river cannot continue to flow if it does not change course, adapt to the land, and merge with other waters.\n\nThe Church, like a river, has its bounds and its rituals. It is not uncommon for its adherents to be rigorous in their attendance, adhering to age-old practices. Yet, this adherence is not without its criticisms. One common complaint is the Church's intolerance towards those who do not strictly follow its doctrine, be they Catholics who falter or adherents of other religions. My own parents' experience, wherein my mother's Catholicism and my father's Episcopalianism prevented their union in the Church, is but one such example.\n\nThe Church preaches love and acceptance, yet it has been accused of hypocrisy in its failure to truly embrace those who do not fit its mold. This hypocrisy is not confined to its doctrine, but also in its practice, which often seems outdated and rigid. The Church continues to cling to these traditions, despite their archaic nature.\n\nThe matter of priests is another contentious one. I believe it would be beneficial for the Church to allow its clergy to marry, but I do not think it would necessarily deter pedophilic behavior among them. After all, the root of such atrocities lies not in marital status, but in the perpetrator's character. A predator, be they married or celibate, would likely act upon their impulses regardless of their marital status. The solution to such issues does not lie in marital status, but in the hearts and minds of the individuals themselves.",
            "Well, I ain't sure yet. The matter's got me tied in knots like a calf in a brier patch. It's like tryin' to split the difference between church and state, and what makes a marriage. It's a tricky business, and I reckon everybody's got their own take. I'm thinkin' maybe we should look at civil unions. Marriage, it's a sacred thing, sure, but the government, they ain't got no business in it. It's between two souls, and that's all there is to it. If the states can agree on something, they ought to make it law. But amendin' the Constitution? That's like tryin' to fix a leak with a hammer. Ain't no way. It's just not that important. So, no, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a household where the word of the Lord held sway, so the matter of homosexuality has always been a land of twilight for me. I have friends who walk that path, and it is a complex terrain to navigate. I do not harbor affection for the lifestyle, yet I believe it should find its place beneath the banner of legality, not as a matter of national debate but as a decision left to each state's discretion.\n\nSome states are of a democratic bent, others tilt republican, and each leans towards their own beliefs on this matter. To live in a state is to align oneself with its values, and I do not think one should question the decisions of their chosen home. I believe homosexuals should be granted the same opportunities as those who walk the well-trodden path of heterosexuality. It is a right that should be granted at the whim of each state, not dictated from on high.\n\nI find no compelling reason for the president, be he Bush or another, to impose his will upon the whole of this nation. He does not dwell in every state, nor should he have the authority to determine their course. The president's tenure is fleeting, and the wind of politics will shift with his departure. If a new president should lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be a matter of back and forth, a seesaw of policy that benefits no one save the lobbyists and their cronies.\n\nI stand firm in my belief that these matters should be left to the judgment of each individual state, for they are the ones who will bear the weight of their decisions. It is not the president's place to determine the fate of every state, nor should he be granted such power. The buck stops with the people, and it should be they who decide their own path.",
            "I reckon I don't at all.\nLet me consider this. I've been told that Myspace is akin to a public bulletin, there for all to see.\nIf one posts on the internet, be it for the public eye or just for others to read, one has to understand that it may reach beyond just the intended audience.\nIn my mind, if school officials happen upon such a post, they've a right to see it, no matter who's doing it or where from. They could've accessed it from their homes, after all.\nThough, if it's to prevent a school shooting, well, I say that's a responsibility they're simply fulfilling.\nNow, if they're prowling the internet just to catch students in the act, that's an invasion of privacy, plain and simple.\nBut if it's to make the school safer, then I can't fault them.\nIt's a public thing, and if a student posts something and doesn't expect to get into trouble, they're being more naive than I'd like.\nI've always been careful with what I put out there, even through emails. I fear something will come back to haunt me, and once it's on the internet, it's there to stay.\nI don't see how that's an invasion of privacy, though. They're just doing what they're supposed to be doing.\nIf they see something that could lead to a safer school environment, then I can't fault them. That's their responsibility, after all.\nSame goes for other officials like the police. Parents send their kids to school expecting a safe environment. School officials are just doing their part to ensure that.\nI've talked to a teacher about this, and they told me about all the drills they have in case of terrorist attacks. It's all about safety, you see.\nAnd that's exactly what the school officials were doing here. They were making the school a safer place. Preventing something like Columbine or worse.\nThat's all I can think to add.",
            "In the bloodied aftermath of September eleventh, I was a voice crying out for vengeance. The world had been set ablaze, and I yearned for retribution. I was all for the charge into the heart of darkness, a crusade to answer in kind the fire that had consumed our shores.\n\nYet, as the sands of time turned, I found myself stirred by doubt. The war, it seemed, was born of emotion, a blaze fueled by grief and anger. We rushed in unprepared, like a man charged at the gates of hell with no more than a flaming torch and a prayer.\n\nThe people of the land, they were like beasts of prey, caught in a ceaseless dance of violence. They fought one another, and we, too, were caught in their whirlwind. It became clear that their war was something other than our own. They did not seek to build, but to destroy, to chase us from their land.\n\nIn retrospect, we were drunk on the intoxicating brew of patriotism and fear. We charged in, not with a plan, but with a prayer. The road to hell, it seems, is paved with good intentions, and we had set our course for a destination we barely understood.\n\nThe president, he was a man of the people, and the people, they clamored for blood. He, too, was caught in the current, swept along by the tide of public opinion. Iraq, it seemed, was the scapegoat, the sacrifice to appease the gods of anger and fear.\n\nYet, even then, I saw the folly of our course. We were not the architects of order, but the spark of chaos. We sought to rebuild, yet we could not even agree on the path to order. Our divisions were as vast as the deserts we sought to tame.\n\nNow, I see the futility of our endeavor. We are like a drunken man stumbling in the dark, grasping for a door that is not there. The land is a wound that will not heal, a beast that will not be tamed. We are the intruders, the interlopers, and our presence is a cancer that will only harm the land.\n\nThe war, it seems, is a cycle, a never-ending dance of violence and death. We can withdraw, and the dance will continue, but the wound will not heal. We can stay, and the wound will fester, but the dance will not end.\n\nWe are the outsiders, the foreigners, and our presence is a poison. We can withdraw, and the poison will dissipate. Or we can stay, and the poison will continue to spread, infecting all who come near.\n\nI do not know if there is a right answer, only that we must find a way to break the cycle. The land, it seems, will not be ours to claim, but we can choose to leave, to allow it to heal in its own way."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the cold expanse of time, the Catholic Church, a colossus in the landscape of human history, stands as a citadel of ancient creeds and dogmas. Yet, it finds itself in a state of flux, its once unyielding walls crumbling under the relentless onslaught of modern thought. The echo of its former might fades as it grapples with the shifting tides of societal norms and moral vistas, a struggle as haunting as the eerie silence of a desolate plain. The church's stance on matters such as the sanctity of marriage and the sacredness of life, rooted in the hallowed texts of centuries past, has become a beacon of resistance in an era where the winds of change carry the scent of heresy. The once unquestioned authority of its teachings now finds itself challenged by the voices of those who seek to carve new paths in the name of progress and understanding. The church's refusal to bend to the will of the times, to adapt to the shifting sands of societal mores, has left it a relic of a bygone era, a monument to rigidity in a world of fluidity. The shadows cast by its unyielding stance on issues such as abortion and the sanctity of marriage grow longer, and the faithful, like lost souls wandering in the night, find no solace in the darkness. The church's fortress walls, once a bastion of strength and resolve, now echo with the hollow whispers of dissent, a testament to the changing tides of time and the relentless march of history.",
            "Well, let me see now. Me, I ain't got no quarrel with the notion of gay marriage. I mean, if it ain't a choice, then it just ain't a choice. You're born that way, or you ain't. I reckon it's like being born with a particular color of eyes, or the shape of your nose. You can't really choose that, can you? So why in the hell should gay folks be held accountable for their orientation? It ain't right, is it, to say a man and a woman can tie the knot, but two people of the same sex can't?\n\nNow, I ain't given it much thought, mind you, but it feels like they don't have a choice in the matter, just like I didn't choose to be straight. If you're born gay, you're gay. And I don't think they should be punished for that. It's not like it's a conscious decision they made, like stepping into a saloon on a Saturday night.\n\nI reckon it's a whole different story when the federal government gets involved. It's not like it's a matter of national security, or some moral concern that's any of their business. It's just plain wrong to interject in people's lives like that. They ain't doing nothing to harm anyone but themselves, and that's their right. It's who they are, and that ain't something that should be punished. It's like trying to change the course of a river.\n\nSo, I say, let 'em be. It's not our place to judge or to interfere. They ain't hurtin' nobody but themselves, and that's all that matters.",
            "I reckon it's high time we legalize gay marriage. Now, I ain't got much of a reason not to, and I'll tell you why. A lot of folks think that homosexual couples pose some sort of threat to the traditional family, but that's just pure nonsense. It's like comparing apples to oranges, plain and simple. It ain't the same thing at all. There's too many different aspects and factors to it. It's just two sides of the same coin, in a way. Heads won't ever be tails, but they're the same coin nonetheless.\n\nNow, let me tell you, there's plenty of civil rights that come along with it. Property taxes, healthcare, all that. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't even be in the room with you when you're sick, can't visit you. That's just silly, if you'll spend the rest of your life with someone. And there's plenty of scientific studies that show as much. Homosexual couples, they're just as successful, just as happy in their relationships as heterosexual couples.\n\nPeople, they get hung up on it, is all. They think that homosexuals are asking to get married in the church, but they ain't. They're just asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document from the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then what's the problem? I can't figure it out. Catholics and their religious beliefs, they're one thing, but that shouldn't have any bearing on the law. If you're allowing someone a civil union, why not give them a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal. They're just the same in many ways, the type of relationship roles and all that. And people, they worry about adoption, about the community, about how a gay couple will affect it. But honestly, it's the same as with heterosexual couples. Parenting skills are the same, personality choices are the same. It's about love and commitment, and that's it.\n\nNow, I reckon the federal government should be involved in this. Make gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should be the opposite. But President Bush, he's got his own strong views on it, and I ain't sure about that. He's got his views on abortion and stem cell research too, and I think most of the reasons he's against it are moral reasons. Morality, it's not something that's black and white, and to go along with one group's morality while ignoring the rest is just plain unethical. It's hypocritical of the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage, considering the recent controversy over the pledge of allegiance.\n\nNow, there's plenty of folks who are anti-gay, anti-gay marriage because they think gay folks are somehow damaged. But that's not a good reason. The American Psychological Association put out a memo about it, and they've done studies and all. If folks would listen to institutions that actually did the research instead of their neighbors and their friends, maybe the world would make more sense.",
            "Now, listen close, if you're gonna be asking me about this here situation, I'll tell you straight, I work in a hospital pharmacy, summer's my season. You see, just 'cause something's illegal don't make it a poison. I'm saying, we use illegal drugs in the pharmacy, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, the list goes on. They're controlled, sure, but they're also beneficial. Why, then, do we deny that same benefit to marijuana, simply 'cause it's got a taboo label?\n\nNow, I ain't saying it's the same as alcohol. Alcohol, it's a slippery slope, but marijuana, it's not that bad. It won't lead you down the same dark path as heroin or cocaine. But people, they see it as this terrible thing, a monster. Take away that stigma, and people might just use it responsibly.\n\nGradual, that's the key. Not all at once, like some kind of plague. But remove that taboo, and who knows? Maybe we can integrate it, let it be legal, but not right off the bat. People need time to learn, to understand, to see it for what it is. A medicine, maybe, if not a vice.",
            "Well, I reckon the church has seen a fair amount of change in these here modern times. It ain't near as stern as it used to be, if you ask me. When I was just a young'un, I'd dress up in my Sunday best, with a cute little dress, matching shoes, and even a purse to match. We'd all meet up at private school on weekends, a right proper sight to behold. But as the years have passed, things have become a mite more casual. Now they've got these teenager masses, all cut down to just thirty minutes. And the folks coming in attire that'd make you think they just stepped off the beach. It's a sight to see, all right.\n\nAs for the politics and whatnot, I'm not one to meddle in such matters. But I reckon the church's done its best, all things considered. I've seen the accusations against priests, and it's a sorry state of affairs. But I don't believe letting women be priests or allowing them to marry would've made a lick of difference. There's men who are married and still find themselves drawn to young'uns. It's in their nature, I reckon, not something that can be changed by a wedding ring. They choose this path of their own volition, and if they can't satisfy their calling in this faith, maybe they should seek elsewhere.\n\nNow, about the pedophilia, I reckon it's more to do with genetics than anything else. You can't hide that away with a marriage, no sir. It's a sorry business, but I don't believe the church could've done much to prevent it, not if they were unaware. But if they knew and tried to hush it up, well, that's another matter entirely. I reckon that's where the blame lies. But all in all, I ain't got much more to say on the matter.",
            "In the wake of September's dark visitation, I found myself initially swayed by the notion, yet it soon became apparent that we were adrift in a tide of deceit. The Bush regime, like a carrion crow, darted upon the carcass of the twin towers, seizing the moment to hawk its falsehoods - Osama's shadow dancing with the specter of Saddam's supposed WMD. The truth, however, was as evasive as the wind through the desert sands.\n\nIndeed, the administration's lies have left a bitter taste upon my tongue, an acrid reminder of their contempt for the Constitution. Powell, the former secretary, now admits to the UN's stage his evidence was but a shadow play, his words echoing hollow in the chamber of deceit he once graced. Malfeasance, he calls it, an impeachable stain upon their souls.\n\nThe Iraq War, a specter born of vengeance, a fever dream of oil and power. The elder Bush, his son's avenging angel, sought to quench the thirst of empire with the blood of the Middle East. Yet, the sands of time have not been kind to our cause. The present, a landscape of chaos and division, the future a uncertain horizon.\n\nThe Bush administration's error, a calamity of their own making. To withdraw now would be to abandon the Iraqis to their fate, a fate of civil war and attrition. The alternative, a coalition of the region's nations, a band of wolves howling at the moon. Their sovereignty, a tenuous thing, a veil for the wind to rend.\n\nThe Parliament, a house of cards, the Prime Minister, a puppet on its string, the radical elements, a hydra of fractious voices. The political process, a storm of factions, a whirlwind of discord. None of this is polite conversation, no, it is the honest truth, the bitter pill we must swallow.",
            "Now, listen here, I ain't got no use for fancy words or big statements. The Iraq war, it's a mess. It wasn't declared, and I reckon it shouldn't have been. We went in, we didn't know why, and we ain't got a clue what's going on now. It's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole. We think we can fix their democracy, make it all American-like, but that ain't how it works. It's like trying to tame a wild beast. We can't just march in and say, \"This here's how you should live.\" It's not our place, and it ain't gonna end well. The families of the soldiers, the folks over there, they're caught in the middle. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. If we stay, we're overstepping, trying to mold them into a nation they don't want to be. And if we leave, it's like we abandoned them. I reckon it's a never-ending cycle. Years and years of strife, of destruction. It's a no-win situation, and I ain't got no solution. That's all I've got to say about it.",
            "In the heart of this matter, I don't believe it to be just to legalize or for a state to declare it legal. The constitution, as clear as the night sky, states the separation of church and state. It is a sacred boundary, a dividing line between what is holy and what is not. To encroach upon this, to try and wield power over it, would be to spit in the face of what is written in stone. The churches, in their divine wisdom, must decide such matters, not the government. The president's push for an amendment, driven by his Catholic convictions, is nothing more than a preference for one faith over every other. This amendment would be a restriction, a shackle on the people, a contradiction of the very principles our constitution stands for. I see no reason for the government to involve itself in this issue, no economic benefit, no societal gain. It is a matter for the churches to decide, not for men in power. This is my belief, and I stand by it.",
            "The war in Iraq, it sets me a-thinking. From the get-go, I reckon the government wasn't entirely forthcoming with the people. They played on the grief and anger of the American folk, linking Iraq to the terrorist acts of September 11th, when, truth be told, there was little connection. They stirred up the emotions, and before you knew it, we were striking Iraq. I, myself, am not one for war, especially not a preemptive one. It seemed a repeat of old mistakes, like Vietnam, and the government should've learned from that.\n\nThe soldiers, they bled and died, and the government removed the Iraqi regime without a plan for what would follow. They tried to plant a democracy, but it was a long and arduous task. The government should've known it wouldn't be a swift victory, like it wasn't in Vietnam. You can't fight a war on citizens, not an army. The government wasn't ready for what came after. We're still there, nearly a decade later, still trying to train their forces, and it's a long process.\n\nI ain't saying we shouldn't have gone to war, but if we were to, we should've planned for every eventuality. The government, they weren't prepared, and they misled the people, making it seem like a quick and easy task. It was a naive belief, thinking it would be quick. Democracy takes time, and it was a long struggle even for us. The government should've known.\n\nIn the presidential election of 2004, I was torn. I reckon I'd have voted for President Bush to let him finish what he started. But now, how can we abandon those we've taken from their home and way of life? Yet, there's the question of American lives, how many is too many? Why just Iraq? It's all about oil, I reckon. We're not invading North Korea, we know they have weapons. It's all about the resources.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, but I doubt it. The war in Iraq is a hard decision, a difficult one, and I hope it's the right one.",
            "In the quiet of my thoughts, I find myself drawn to the idea of gay marriage. It has always been so, a personal preference, a matter of the heart and mind. It's a choice that's as natural as rain in the desert, a biological inclination, not some sociological whim. To deny such a fundamental aspect of one's being, to strip it of rights, is to commit an act of cruelty. It's a dark echo of the past, a time when men burned books and women were shackled to their places. We have come far, yet still, there are those who would have us turn back.\n\nI've seen it in my own neighborhood, where two or three couples live openly, their love as visible as the sun at noon. They walk their dogs, as any family would, and yet, because of the law, they are not allowed to call each other husband and wife. It's a absurdity, a mockery of the institution it claims to protect. It's like Bush trying to play God, interpreting the word 'marriage' to fit into his own Bible belt.\n\nThe truth is, it's a chemical thing in the brain, a predisposition, like the color of one's eyes. It's not something that can be taught or unlearned. It's as natural as the sun rising in the east. And yet, it's not just about the couple, but the family they create, the life they build. It's a private matter, a personal one, not something to be paraded in the public square.\n\nI've read about it, heard it from the mouths of doctors and scientists, seen it in the pages of newspapers and on the screens of televisions. It's not a choice, not a lifestyle, but a reality, as real as the earth beneath our feet. And yet, there are those who would have us believe otherwise, who would have us turn away from the truth.\n\nNo, I won't. I won't turn away from the truth, won't deny the reality of what I see, of what I feel. I won't be silent while others are denied their rights, their dignity. For I am not just a respecter of marriage, but a believer in equality, in the right of every individual to pursue their happiness, to love whom they choose, to live their lives as they see fit.",
            "Ah, the internet. A vast and uncharted territory, a wilderness of sorts, where words and actions find their way to the ears and eyes of all. When you cast your thoughts or deeds into this digital frontier, you cannot neatly fence them off nor expect them to remain unscathed. Nay, they are shared, seen, and heard by the world at large.\n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I've seen firsthand the consequences of careless words in this digital expanse. You see, the internet is not a place of isolation, but a public forum, a virtual town square. Whatever you post, it becomes a part of your reputation, a thread in the tapestry of your character. And if you spew tales of violence or destruction, as some might say, \"Here be dragons,\" someone is bound to take notice.\n\nConsider the time at our school, when a whisper became a storm. A word, overheard and amplified, reached the school's ears. The administration could not ignore it, for their duty is to protect and guide. They could not let it lie, lest they be held accountable if a calamity befell. Yet, how to discern the jest from the serious? Some fool around, post without thought, their words taken as truth, while others mean well in their jest, but their words find no humor in the eyes of others.\n\nThe internet, it seems, has no respect for privacy. If you wish to keep something hidden, do not put it out there for all to see. And if you cry foul when others see what you've made public, you are akin to the man who builds a fire in the forest and complains when it scorches his house.\n\nThe school officials, they tread a fine line. They must be vigilant, for their duty is to safeguard, not to invade. But when danger is brought to their attention, they must act, lest they be found negligent. And while I do not advocate for snooping into the private lives of students, if a whisper of danger reaches their ears, they must listen. For to ignore a warning is to risk a tragedy.\n\nAnd when it comes to friendships and connections, I, too, maintain a distance. I would not befriend my residents on such platforms, for then I would be privy to their private lives, their foibles and triumphs. It is not my place to judge, nor to be a part of their personal lives. But if a whisper of danger reaches my ears, then I, too, must act, for the safety of all is at stake.\n\nSo, tread lightly, dear student, in this digital wilderness. For once you post, you cannot unpost, and the words you speak may echo long after you've moved on. Keep your thoughts and actions private, lest they become public, and remember, in this vast expanse of the internet, there is no such thing as complete privacy.",
            "In the yawning maw of this war, I have come to feel a rising unease, a gnawing sensation that the purpose has been forgotten. It began with a noble aim, a quest to bring democracy to a land choked under the despot's yoke. Yet, the spirit of that purpose has since withered, like the sun-kissed plains of our troops' march. Now, we fight not for the betterment of another's soul, but to prove ourselves a force to be reckoned with. The initial spark that ignited this conflict was a tale of family feuds and old grudges, a tangled web that entangled us in this endless dance of death and destruction.\n\nThe first few months were enough to send a clear message, to let the world know who we were. But the war has stretched on, a hungry beast fed by the blood of young men and the whispers of lost causes. We have long since lost our path, our purpose diluted like ink in water. We fight not for the freedom of others, but for the sake of fighting itself, a spectacle to prove our might. The time has come for us to step back, to let the locals fend for themselves, to tend to our own wounds and heal our own land.\n\nWe have spent untold billions, not on the well-being of our own citizens, but on the ashes of a foreign land. We have forgotten the plight of our own, the poverty and despair that festers within our own borders. This war, once a beacon of hope, has become a drain on our resources, a leech sucking the life from our nation. We must turn our gaze inward, to the roads that need mending, to the schools that cry out for attention, to the healthcare that is a privilege, not a right.\n\nThe war has gone on long enough. It is time to stop, to let the dust settle, to tend to our own wounds and heal our own land. For too long, we have been the torturer and the tortured, the executioner and the executed, the warrior and the war. It is time to turn away from this endless war, to focus on the needs of our own people, to let the world know that our strength lies not in distant battles, but in the unity and prosperity of our own land.",
            "Can I inquire, sir, about a matter that troubles my mind? I heard of an incident wherein a life was spared, yet I am uncertain of the circumstances.\n\nIt seems that some individual chanced upon a profile, obscured by the veil of the internet. Is this not an intrusion upon the sanctity of one's privacy? On sites such as Myspace, we must understand, once we post our information, it is exposed to the world.\n\nI am told that on Myspace, one must first be accepted as a 'friend' to view another's profile. Yet, this acceptance implies a tacit consent, does it not? If we share our lives on the internet, we must accept that many will gaze upon our private moments.\n\nIt is a delicate balance, this dance with the web. We may not have the time nor the resources to monitor every profile of every student in our school. But to target certain students, to delve into their private lives, is it not an act of discrimination? I wonder, what situation would justify such intrusion?\n\nI, myself, maintain a Facebook account. The thought of unseen eyes peering into my existence disturbs me. I have witnessed, on the screen, a man extracting information from a girl's profile with ease. Yet, I too have encountered strangers who seem to know me well, as if they have delved into my soul. It is a precarious situation, this digital world.\n\nMy roommate shared a tale of her high school days, where students were forbidden from using Myspace. I cannot fathom the power of high school officials to dictate such rules. Is this not an encroachment upon our privacy?",
            "Upshot of our discourse, son, is that I ain't one to beat the drum for the Iraq War. How could I be? It's been a tumbleweed of a mess, like a bloody sandstorm in the desert. From before we set foot in the godforsaken place to now, it's been a carpetbaggin' of errors and missteps. Just speakin' of it makes my teeth grind like a stone mill. Who in their right mind thought it a good idea to storm into Saddam's den? The world, for the most part, was screaming no, but those in charge, they just hummed along, deaf to the pleas and the evidence of the wind. I'm not one to join the chorus of the choir, but it's plain as day that the Iraqis, the folks we claimed to be helpin', want us to pack up and leave. Even the soldiers, the boots on the ground, they ain't fools. They see the futility, the quicksand we're sinkin' into. The administration, well, they're like a drunkard on a barstool, stuck in their delusions, clingin' to a hope that's as thin as a mosque's curtain. They talk about the problems that'll arise if we leave, but I ask you, what problems won't? This ain't about bein' the good guys, but about bein' the ones who make a clean getaway. It's a tightrope act, and we're danglin' from a frayin' thread.",
            "I reckon gender discrimination still lingers in these here United States. It ain't just women, mind you. No, sir. It's a matter of the specific trade you're in.\n\nTake the workplace, for instance. There's this... glass ceiling, they call it. It's like society's got a hard time seeing a woman above them. It's been that way for too long. You see a woman with all the qualifications for a job, but the board won't have her. It ain't right, that's for sure.\n\nNow, it's not just women either. Men have their own battles. Like in fashion, for example. People won't take 'em seriously, you know? They think, \"Well, how can a man know anything about fashion when it's for women?\" It's a strange sight, that's sure. But it's changing, slow as molasses, but it's changing.\n\nSociety's got to be reminded, you see. You can't just shove it in their faces. You gotta show 'em the good qualities. Like those men who stay at home to raise the kids. People look down on that, but it's changing, bit by bit.\n\nIt ain't easy, changing minds. We've come a long way, sure, but change takes time. It's like turning a ship. You can't just steer it straight at a cliff and expect it to turn. No, sir. You gotta nudge it, gently, towards the right path.\n\nSame goes for where you're from. If you're from a farm and you ain't got the best grammar, but you're smart as a whip, people might look down on you. They might think you ain't no CEO material. But they'd be wrong. It's like that old saying goes, \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\"\n\nSo, yeah, it's complicated. But we're getting there. Slow and steady, we're winning the race.",
            "In the quiet of my thoughts, I have discerned that what some call legalization was not the path we've trod, but rather decriminalization. A shift from the cold embrace of criminal law to a ticket, a merely inconvenient citation, akin to a speeding infraction. The weight of a cannabis charge, once a heavy burden, has been lifted, yet the specter of future ramifications lingers.\n\nThe financial toll of arresting, housing, and trying those accused is a burden many municipalities find too costly. The stark realization that such expenditure could fund public education, care for the elderly, and feed the destitute is a compelling argument. Yet, not all communities are so swayed, their moral compass still anchored against the indulgence of cannabis.\n\nDenver, a city of liberal leanings, has embraced this path, finding solace in the financial liberation it affords. The streets may not be filled with open embrace of marijuana, but the financial burden lifted has allowed for greater good to be achieved.\n\nThe question of open sale and use remains a touchy subject. The thought of cannabis being as prevalent as cigarettes is...well, unsettling. Our society still views it as taboo in many contexts, and I harbor concern that its open embrace would be met with discomfort.\n\nThe effects of alcohol and marijuana on the human mind and body are well-documented, and I would not generalize their impacts. Some react with restraint, others with abandon, and still others with moderation. The path of each is as varied as the substance itself.\n\nIn the end, I find myself at a crossroads, torn between the financial liberation and the societal discomfort. The question, as it always has been, is not one of morality, but of practicality.",
            "I would say no, for a multitude of reasons. The Catholic Church, in its prolonged tenure, has indeed been steadfast in its traditions, a virtue in its own right, yet it also needs to be flexible, like a river carving its path through the land. A river cannot continue to flow if it does not change course, adapt to the land, and merge with other waters.\n\nThe Church, like a river, has its bounds and its rituals. It is not uncommon for its adherents to be rigorous in their attendance, adhering to age-old practices. Yet, this adherence is not without its criticisms. One common complaint is the Church's intolerance towards those who do not strictly follow its doctrine, be they Catholics who falter or adherents of other religions. My own parents' experience, wherein my mother's Catholicism and my father's Episcopalianism prevented their union in the Church, is but one such example.\n\nThe Church preaches love and acceptance, yet it has been accused of hypocrisy in its failure to truly embrace those who do not fit its mold. This hypocrisy is not confined to its doctrine, but also in its practice, which often seems outdated and rigid. The Church continues to cling to these traditions, despite their archaic nature.\n\nThe matter of priests is another contentious one. I believe it would be beneficial for the Church to allow its clergy to marry, but I do not think it would necessarily deter pedophilic behavior among them. After all, the root of such atrocities lies not in marital status, but in the perpetrator's character. A predator, be they married or celibate, would likely act upon their impulses regardless of their marital status. The solution to such issues does not lie in marital status, but in the hearts and minds of the individuals themselves.",
            "Well, I ain't sure yet. The matter's got me tied in knots like a calf in a brier patch. It's like tryin' to split the difference between church and state, and what makes a marriage. It's a tricky business, and I reckon everybody's got their own take. I'm thinkin' maybe we should look at civil unions. Marriage, it's a sacred thing, sure, but the government, they ain't got no business in it. It's between two souls, and that's all there is to it. If the states can agree on something, they ought to make it law. But amendin' the Constitution? That's like tryin' to fix a leak with a hammer. Ain't no way. It's just not that important. So, no, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a household where the word of the Lord held sway, so the matter of homosexuality has always been a land of twilight for me. I have friends who walk that path, and it is a complex terrain to navigate. I do not harbor affection for the lifestyle, yet I believe it should find its place beneath the banner of legality, not as a matter of national debate but as a decision left to each state's discretion.\n\nSome states are of a democratic bent, others tilt republican, and each leans towards their own beliefs on this matter. To live in a state is to align oneself with its values, and I do not think one should question the decisions of their chosen home. I believe homosexuals should be granted the same opportunities as those who walk the well-trodden path of heterosexuality. It is a right that should be granted at the whim of each state, not dictated from on high.\n\nI find no compelling reason for the president, be he Bush or another, to impose his will upon the whole of this nation. He does not dwell in every state, nor should he have the authority to determine their course. The president's tenure is fleeting, and the wind of politics will shift with his departure. If a new president should lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be a matter of back and forth, a seesaw of policy that benefits no one save the lobbyists and their cronies.\n\nI stand firm in my belief that these matters should be left to the judgment of each individual state, for they are the ones who will bear the weight of their decisions. It is not the president's place to determine the fate of every state, nor should he be granted such power. The buck stops with the people, and it should be they who decide their own path.",
            "I reckon I don't at all.\nLet me consider this. I've been told that Myspace is akin to a public bulletin, there for all to see.\nIf one posts on the internet, be it for the public eye or just for others to read, one has to understand that it may reach beyond just the intended audience.\nIn my mind, if school officials happen upon such a post, they've a right to see it, no matter who's doing it or where from. They could've accessed it from their homes, after all.\nThough, if it's to prevent a school shooting, well, I say that's a responsibility they're simply fulfilling.\nNow, if they're prowling the internet just to catch students in the act, that's an invasion of privacy, plain and simple.\nBut if it's to make the school safer, then I can't fault them.\nIt's a public thing, and if a student posts something and doesn't expect to get into trouble, they're being more naive than I'd like.\nI've always been careful with what I put out there, even through emails. I fear something will come back to haunt me, and once it's on the internet, it's there to stay.\nI don't see how that's an invasion of privacy, though. They're just doing what they're supposed to be doing.\nIf they see something that could lead to a safer school environment, then I can't fault them. That's their responsibility, after all.\nSame goes for other officials like the police. Parents send their kids to school expecting a safe environment. School officials are just doing their part to ensure that.\nI've talked to a teacher about this, and they told me about all the drills they have in case of terrorist attacks. It's all about safety, you see.\nAnd that's exactly what the school officials were doing here. They were making the school a safer place. Preventing something like Columbine or worse.\nThat's all I can think to add.",
            "In the bloodied aftermath of September eleventh, I was a voice crying out for vengeance. The world had been set ablaze, and I yearned for retribution. I was all for the charge into the heart of darkness, a crusade to answer in kind the fire that had consumed our shores.\n\nYet, as the sands of time turned, I found myself stirred by doubt. The war, it seemed, was born of emotion, a blaze fueled by grief and anger. We rushed in unprepared, like a man charged at the gates of hell with no more than a flaming torch and a prayer.\n\nThe people of the land, they were like beasts of prey, caught in a ceaseless dance of violence. They fought one another, and we, too, were caught in their whirlwind. It became clear that their war was something other than our own. They did not seek to build, but to destroy, to chase us from their land.\n\nIn retrospect, we were drunk on the intoxicating brew of patriotism and fear. We charged in, not with a plan, but with a prayer. The road to hell, it seems, is paved with good intentions, and we had set our course for a destination we barely understood.\n\nThe president, he was a man of the people, and the people, they clamored for blood. He, too, was caught in the current, swept along by the tide of public opinion. Iraq, it seemed, was the scapegoat, the sacrifice to appease the gods of anger and fear.\n\nYet, even then, I saw the folly of our course. We were not the architects of order, but the spark of chaos. We sought to rebuild, yet we could not even agree on the path to order. Our divisions were as vast as the deserts we sought to tame.\n\nNow, I see the futility of our endeavor. We are like a drunken man stumbling in the dark, grasping for a door that is not there. The land is a wound that will not heal, a beast that will not be tamed. We are the intruders, the interlopers, and our presence is a cancer that will only harm the land.\n\nThe war, it seems, is a cycle, a never-ending dance of violence and death. We can withdraw, and the dance will continue, but the wound will not heal. We can stay, and the wound will fester, but the dance will not end.\n\nWe are the outsiders, the foreigners, and our presence is a poison. We can withdraw, and the poison will dissipate. Or we can stay, and the poison will continue to spread, infecting all who come near.\n\nI do not know if there is a right answer, only that we must find a way to break the cycle. The land, it seems, will not be ours to claim, but we can choose to leave, to allow it to heal in its own way."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In this day and age, the Catholic Church finds itself at a crossroads, its once steadfast flock beginning to waver. The reasons for this, I believe, lie within the Church's unyielding stance on matters that have evolved with time. The institution has always been steadfast in its views on matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views, while firm and rooted in tradition, are not always in tune with the shifting sentiments of the modern world.\n\nThe Church's rigid stance on such issues has caused some to question its relevance and has led many to seek solace elsewhere. The younger generations, in particular, are turning away from the Church because they do not share its views on these subjects. The Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, can be a barrier for those who believe in the right to choose. Similarly, its stance against same-sex marriage can be a hurdle for those who wish to celebrate their love openly and legally.\n\nI am not advocating for the complete abandonment of these traditional views, but rather for a more nuanced approach that can accommodate the diverse beliefs and values of its followers. The Church's insistence that priests dedicate their lives to God, forsaking worldly pleasures and attachments, is a noble mission. However, it is not without its drawbacks. The Church's ban on marriage for priests, for example, can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which may not be conducive to the well-being of the clergy.\n\nThe Church's history is filled with tales of its leaders, both good and bad, and it is impossible to say with certainty whether a more permissive stance on marriage and female ordination would have prevented the scandals that have shaken the Church's foundations. It is a complex issue, one that cannot be simplified into a single solution. However, it is clear that the Church must engage with these questions openly and honestly, for the sake of its future.",
            "Well, now.\n\nMe, personally, I ain't got no problem with that here.\n\nSeems to me like it's not somethin' one can just choose, like a hat or a drink. Born that way, or whatever. Ain't no choice in the matter.\n\nSo, I reckon it's high time we stop holdin' folks accountable for somethin' they can't help, like the color of their eyes or the slope of their nose. Same goes for the way they're drawn to others. It's just the way they are, like the land or the weather. Ain't right to say one can and one can't, just 'cause they're different.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' I've give this here topic much thought. But I know what I know. And it seems to me like it's wrong to say a man can wed a woman, but two folks of the same stripe can't. Just don't make no sense.\n\nAnd the federal government? They got their hands full with the big stuff, like keepin' us safe and all. Ain't their place to meddle in folks' private lives and decisions. It's like a judge tryin' to teach a fly how to fly. Just don't work that way.\n\nSo, leave them be. They're just folks, same as the rest of us. Born that way, and they shouldn't be punished for it. That's all there is to it.",
            "I reckon that legalizing gay marriage is a notion that bears consideration, even if some see it as a threat to traditional unions. The arguments against it are many, yet they pale in comparison to the simple truth that love is love, regardless of whom it embraces. Many believe that homosexual couples are an abomination, a perversion of nature, but this is a stance born of ignorance and fear, not fact. The children of such unions, they say, will be raised in a shadow, their moral compass skewed by the unorthodox nature of their parents. But what of the countless studies that have shown no difference in the success of these unions compared to their heterosexual counterparts? The idea that gay couples will raise their children to be flawed, broken, is a fallacy. The role of a parent is not defined by their sexual orientation but by their love, guidance, and the values they instill in their children. The government, too, should not be a arbiter of such intimate matters. It is a matter of civil rights, of equality under the law. To deny one group these rights is to perpetuate segregation, separate but unequal. The federal government should step in, not to impose its will, but to ensure that all citizens are treated as such, regardless of who they choose to love. The moral high ground is not the exclusive domain of any one religion or culture. It is a shared responsibility, a collective effort to create a society that values compassion, understanding, and equality. To deny the rights of others based on their sexual orientation is to deny the very essence of what it means to be American.",
            "Well, first off, I tend the pharmacy over the summer, just like I tend to the dying in the night. Now, Jus' cause somethin' is illegal don't mean it ain't got its uses. I've seen the likes of oxycodone and vicodin run through here, and they're as beneficial as they are controlled. But I'd say, no, I'd say we shouldn't be just tossin' it out there for the public, like a pack of wild dogs. No, no, but for medicinal purposes? Absolutely, I'd say yes. Just 'cause a drug is illegal don't make it less so. It's not beneficial, no sir.\n\nYou see, there's a world of drugs out there, like a pack of wolves waitin' to be let loose. Oxycodone, vicodin, percocets, they're all just as dangerous as the next. But we use 'em 'cause they've got a purpose. And if you deny that purpose just 'cause there's a stigma 'round marijuana, well, that's like lettin' a good dog starve. You should embrace its benefits, I reckon.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's the same as alcohol, but neither is it nothin' like heroine or cocaine. It's just... different.

            "Well, the church has seen a shift in the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it once was. When I was younger, I'd go every Sunday, dressed in cute little dresses and matching shoes, seeing all my friends in the same attire. Now, they've introduced a teenager's mass, cut down to thirty minutes, and the dress code has relaxed significantly. People show up in beachwear during summer, families come late, and even the morning masses have seen a casual turn. People wear jeans and khakis now, which, to be honest, is quite practical but far removed from the pristine outfits of old. As for the church's politics or the scandals involving priests, I don't know the ins and outs, but I don't think changes like allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the pedophilia accusations. Men who are married can still be attracted to children, and it's not just a matter of being allowed or not. It's a matter of wanting to serve the church and potentially not being suited for it. There are other faiths that allow marriage, so those who want to practice their faith and be married should consider other paths. I believe the attraction to children is often genetic and not entirely a result of upbringing. You can't change someone's genetics through marriage, and if they know about it and cover it up, that's shameful, but I think not all instances were known. Other than that, I have no further thoughts on the matter.",
            "It was all well and good at first, I suppose. But with the echoes of September eleventh still ringing in our ears, we found ourselves in a land far from our shores, waging war on a premise that would soon unravel like a cheap tapestry. The Iraq war, a specter that haunts our collective consciousness, was a pretext, a mirage that led us astray. The Bush administration, with its litany of falsehoods, weaved a web of deceit, asserting that Saddam Hussein's regime was a threat, that weapons of mass destruction lurked within his grasp. Yet, the truth was as elusive as the morning mist, and the arm of justice has yet to reach out and grasp the Bush administration's neck.\n\nColin Powell, once a voice of authority, now echoes in the chambers of shame, confessing his doubts, his misgivings. He, like many, believed the lies, the half-truths, the deceptions. The Constitution, a sacred text, was trampled upon, its words twisted, its intent derided. The Bush administration, it seems, entered office with a dark purpose, a vengeance that burned like a fever, a desire to expand, to control.\n\nThe war drags on, a festering wound on the face of humanity. Withdrawal, a thought that sends a shiver down the spine, would be akin to leaving a child in the dark, a lamb in the jaws of a wolf. Civil war, a specter that looms large, would take its toll, a harvest of blood and tears. The coalition, a motley crew of nations, would step into the breach, but can they restore order in a land where the very fabric of government dissolves like sand between our fingers?\n\nThe interim government, a fragile construct, crumbles under the weight of its own instability. The Prime Minister, a shadow of his former self, struggles to maintain control over the political process, a raging river that threatens to sweep him away. The Parliament, a fractious body, is but a reflection of the chaos that reigns. And the radicals, those who once fought against us, now hold sway, a testament to the turmoil that grips the heart of Iraq.\n\nNone of this is the world we wanted to see. Yet, it is the world we inhabit, a land of shadows and uncertainty.",
            "I did just as the wind does, in a breath. Aye, there's the matter of the Iraq War. I reckon it's become a point of contention, like a bone between two hounds. The war, it wasn't declared by Congress, you see. It was a matter of retribution, a strike against them who we figured planted the seeds of the eleven's horror. Now, I ain't one to keep track of such things, but I know we're there to build a democracy, to mold 'em in our image. Oil, too, plays its part, but I think it's a fool's errand. They're a people with a different way, and we're trying to force our hand upon them. It's like trying to bend a river, it only serves to create a flood. We should withdraw, let's not prolong their agony and our own. It's a tricky thing, this war. It's not fair, but it's a fact. We should let them find their own way, not force our own upon them.

            "I don't see fit to make it so, for the state to declare it legal, or even to legalize it at all. I believe the churches should have their say, as the Constitution itself stands witness to the separation of church and state. It is plainly stated, and I believe any attempt to wield power over it would be tantamount to defying what has been written in stone. In the eyes of those who seek to make it illegal, it seems they are imposing one belief over another, as the majority of Catholics and Christians are against it, save for a few pockets like Boston. I don't see it as the government's place to decide what is legal and illegal for the churches. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our Constitution, a beacon for religious tolerance. To add an amendment on this matter would be a contradiction to what is already in place, and quite possibly the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. It is not right. I do not believe the federal government, nor any government, should involve itself in this matter. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, revealing a preference for one religion over others. This is not a matter for the president or any government official. There is no sound reasoning behind this amendment save for personal views. It won't impact the economy, and I believe it could even have a positive impact on society. I've said my piece.",
            "The war in Iraq... It began with a lie, a deceit woven into the very fabric of our nation's decision to march into that foreign land. The government, they said, had weapons of mass destruction, a threat to our very existence. But it was a lie, a tale spun to rouse the emotions of a people still raw from the scars of September 11th. The government, they said, would liberate the Iraqis, bring them democracy. Yet, they were not prepared, not at all.\n\nThe war was a repeat, a echo of the Vietnam War, a war of insurgents and citizen soldiers. The government, they should have known better, should have learned from the past. But they were blind, blinded by the oil, blinded by the money. They removed the government, but they were not ready for what came next, the chaos, the void of power. They tried to plant democracy, but it was a long and hard process, a process that our own country had struggled through, a struggle of tension and civil war.\n\nAnd now, years later, we are still there, still dying, still trying to train the Iraqis, to teach them how to police their own country. The government, they were not prepared, not at all. They tried to deceive us, make us believe it would be a quick and easy victory. But it was not, it was a long and hard battle, a battle that was not won, not truly won.\n\nThe war in Iraq, it was a difficult decision, a decision that still weighs heavily on my mind. I would have voted for Bush, to let him finish what he started. But now, how can we abandon them? We took their government, their way of life. How can we abandon them now? But there is also the consideration, the awful consideration of the American casualties, the American blood spilled for a cause that would never truly be won.\n\nAnd the oil, the oil, it was the reason, the true reason. It was all about the money, the resources. It was not about democracy, not truly. Why Iraq and not North Korea, with their weapons of mass destruction? It was the oil, the oil that fueled our decisions, that guided our hands.\n\nLet the war end, let the peace come. But it will not be soon, not truly.",
            "Well, now, let's see here. I reckon I've always been in favor of the notion of gay marriage. It's a personal thing, plain and simple. I think it's a matter of biology more than sociology, and denying folks the right to marry based on something they can't control seems plain inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for it, you see.\n\nI don't think politics or the government ought to have a say in it. It's a personal affair, not something the state or federal government needs to be involved with. Look at my neighborhood, for instance. We've got a couple of openly gay couples, and they're just like any other family. They walk their dogs, tend to their gardens, and mind their own business. It's just the way it ought to be.\n\nNow, I've read and heard from numerous sources that there's a biological aspect to being homosexual. It's not just about growing up in a certain environment or having a certain upbringing. It's something innate, something that's been proven time and time again.\n\nAnd let's talk about marriage, shall we? If a man and a woman want to get hitched, they can just up and do it without telling a soul. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's front-page news. I think that's just wrong. Marriage should be a private matter, not something for the public or the government to dictate.\n\nNo, I don't think it's right to deny folks the right to marry because of their sexual orientation. It's a personal choice, and it's nobody else's business.",

You can't just go spewing whatever you please about blowing things up or shootings, think about it. Someone's gonna take it the wrong way. The internet's a public forum, and you can't control how people interpret your words. It's like a wildfire, once it starts, there's no telling where it'll end up.\n\nI've seen it myself, where someone overhears something at school and goes running to the authorities. They can't just let it be, not when lives are on the line. But here's the thing, you can't tell what's real and what's just fooling around. It could be a sociology experiment gone wrong, or it could be a real threat. One time, we had someone who was overheard saying something, and when we looked into it, we found they had posted things on their Facebook that seemed serious, even if they were meant as jokes. You can't predict how people will react.\n\nNow, I ain't saying schools should be snooping on students' social media accounts. But if something's brought to their attention, they've got a duty to take it seriously. It's about safety, plain and simple. If it's a real threat, they can't just ignore it. And as for teachers, they shouldn't be sneaking around on social media, pretending to be someone they ain't. That's just creepy. But if a student brings something to their attention, that's different. They've given them access to their online world, and it's only right they take it seriously.\n\nSo, my advice? Think before you post. Don't put things out there that you don't want people to see. Because once it's out there, it's out there. And you can't control what people think or how they react. It's like writing in the sand, you never know who might see it, or how they'll interpret it.",
            "In the quietude of the American night, the war drags on, a relentless river of blood and sand. It was a noble purpose, once, to restore democracy to a land shrouded in tyranny. But as the years bleed into one another, the original intent fades, like a ghost in the desert sun. We wage this conflict now, not for the sake of freedom, but to prove our might, to be the unchallenged colossus of the world. And what of Motive? Who can say if the embers of our resolve were not fanned by the ghosts of old debts, the embers of George Bush Senior's enmity with Saddam Hussein? If the purpose was to bestow democracy on a land devoid of fair governance, then so be it. But if personal grievances were the true currency, then we find ourselves adrift, drunk on the blood of innocents.\n\nWe have sent our purpose into the world, like a clarion call, in the first months of this war. But now, as the years stretch on, the clarity of that purpose dissolves. This is not a war of principle, but a war of will, a stubborn refusal to admit defeat or concede defeat. We do not want to retreat, tarnished and battered, without a decisive end, a final, triumphant cry.\n\nThe war has gone on long enough. Too long. The government of Iraq must now stand on its own, as we once did. Our resources are not endless, and every dollar spent on this foreign conflict is a dollar not spent on our own war, the war against poverty, the war to heal our own lands. The roads that crumble, the schools that fail, the hospitals that lack, they are the battlegrounds of our time, and they deserve more than the crumbs we offer them.\n\nWe have spent billions, and the war is not something to be woven into the fabric of our budget, like a decoration on a grand tapestry. There are battles to be fought at home, and they need our attention, our resources, our resolve. We cannot afford to bleed on foreign soil while our own needs go unmet. For in the end, it is our own land that will bear the scars of this war, our own people who will feel the sting of our withdrawal, our own economy that will recoil from the drain of this endless struggle.",
            "Can I inquire, perhaps, if I might clarify a matter?\n\nI suppose the fact is, it was averted through the intervention of an individual who, by happenstance, chanced upon the information online.\n\nWell, now, that's the crux of the matter, ain't it? If one chooses to put forth personal tidings on the internet, then it's fair to say the world may as well have a peek.\n\nTake Myspace, for instance. You see, it's no secret that to view another's profile, one must first accept them as a \"friend.\" It's a covenant, if you will. But once that bond is forged, it's akin to giving them a key to your own personal sanctum.\n\nNow, it's a curious conundrum, isn't it? For we know well that by sharing our lives online, we invite a multitude of eyes to gaze upon our secrets. And who can say if any of those eyes may harbor ill intent?\n\nI, myself, have not delved into the realms of Myspace, but Facebook, now that's a different matter. I'll wager it's akin to walking through a market square, where one can't help but catch a glimpse of the wares laid bare for all to see.\n\nIt troubles me, this knowledge that there are those who lurk in the shadows, snooping about like vultures. I've heard tales of men who, with naught but a few clicks, can unmask your true name and weave a web of deceit. It's a precarious dance, this life in the digital age.\n\nI've come across instances where individuals in my classes, whose faces I know not, have sent me messages, knowing full well who I am. They have seen my interests laid bare, my daily schedule laid out like a map. It's a disquieting feeling, to know that one's most private thoughts are accessible to the public.\n\nBut I suppose there's a balance to be struck. For while I limit what I share, I also wish to remain connected with those I hold dear. It's a delicate line to walk, this journey through the digital frontier.\n\nI've heard tell that in some high schools, they've forbidden students from having Myspace accounts altogether. It strikes me as a peculiar notion, that those who ought to be guiding us could dictate what we may or may not do in our personal lives.\n\nI reckon it's a matter of privacy, and perhaps a question of power. But I'm not one to speak on such matters with any certainty. It's a world that's ever-changing, this digital realm, and we're but mere pioneers, forging our way through uncharted territories.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and then one more time that I must speak on the Iraq War\nUm\nYes\nI mean, I feel hypocritical discussing it\nI mean, I hate to say, you know\nI hate to join the bandwagon of those who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but like it’s not really important anymore\nCause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t care to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nThey’ve done Iraqi polls\nThey’ve done global polls\nAnd I mean, no, like about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops that are over there\nLike the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in\nIt was already a disaster\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s just too big a gap and for administrations past and present to understand\nAnd they think that they can just like bring Democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean, sure Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s arguing that he’s not\nBut, I mean, you have to weight the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to\nYou know turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these\nThese are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know, if it completely goes to shit we could be like well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean, if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than you know where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Damn, the world's still a godforsaken mess when it comes to how we treat each other based on our sex. It's a long road to walk, full of hard knocks and twisted paths. Men and women, we're all just trying to carve out a place for ourselves, but the game's rigged, and the deck's stacked against us.\n\nTake, for instance, the business world. It's still a man's world, and women have to walk a mile in their shoes just to prove they're worth their salt. They've got the qualifications, the brains, and the guts, but the board won't budge, not because they're not good enough, but because society's still stuck in the dusty past. The glass ceiling's still up there, and it's not about to shatter anytime soon.\n\nAnd it's not just about women. Men, too, have their own battles to fight. In fields like fashion, where the world's already got a certain image in its mind, men can't break the mold. They're met with raised eyebrows and skeptical glances. \"How can a man know fashion?\" they'll ask. \"Isn't that a woman's thing?\"\n\nSociety's mindset's like a stubborn mule, and changing it's no easy task. It's a slow, painful process, but we're making progress. Women are rising to the top, taking on CEO positions, and it's starting to click for some people. Men staying at home, raising the kids, it's not the norm, but it's becoming more accepted. They're realizing, hey, maybe the woman's the breadwinner this time around.\n\nBut the fight's not just about sex. It's about class, about where you come from. A man from a farm, with his hands calloused and his grammar rough, he's got to fight twice as hard to prove he's got what it takes. Other men, they won't look at him straight, not with his words all twisted up. It's a goddamn shame, but it's the truth.\n\nWe've come a long way, but the road's far from over. Change's a slow, steady thing, like the tide coming in. It's not about forcing it, it's about showing the good in people, the qualities that make them shine. It's about patience, about time. And hope, too. We've got to keep fighting, keep pushing, keep chipping away at the old ways. Because, dammit, we deserve better. We all do.",
            "Well,\nThey didn't so much legalize it as they did decriminalize it. Knocked it down from a criminal offense, like a pebble tumbling from a mountain to a mere traffic infraction. A citation, a slap on the wrist, rather than the cuffs and the cell. As the kid put it, \"a ticket's what you get now, not a trip to the lockup.\" And I reckon that's where the real trouble starts. Job interviews, college applications, all those future prospects tainted by a mark on your record. A stain harder to wash out than blood from the floorboards of a saloon. But there's more to it than that. Costs money, it does, to arrest someone, book 'em, feed 'em, defend 'em. And then there's the court, the lawyers, the whole circus. A municipality on the brink, how much can they afford to spend on something like this? And then there's the philosophies, the morals, the \"liberal\" sentiments. Denver, it's different there. More open, more money to spend on education, social programs, aid for the poor. But it ain't for everyone. Marijuana, it's not something you want everywhere, all the time. It's a tricky business, this legalization. It's like trying to tame a storm. Some folks say it's a slippery slope, others say it's long overdue. But one thing's for sure, it's a storm that's brewing. And the wind's picking up.",
            "I would say yes, for the sake of tradition, yes, but also for the sake of adaptability, yes. A lot of the Catholic ways are as old as the hills, deeply rooted and unchanged for centuries. And I suppose tradition, well, it's like the roots of an ancient oak - it keeps us grounded. But we must also be like the willow, bending with the wind, adapting to change. Yet, there are those who cling to the doctrine like a drowning man to a splinter.\n\nMany a Catholic believes they must attend church weekly, and they're rigid in their rituals. The Church, it seems, doesn't take kindly to those who deviate from the straight and narrow. They turn away those who aren't perfect, and those of other religions, it seems, are as unwelcome as a stranger in a strange land. My own parents, my father an Episcopalian, my mother a Catholic, they weren't allowed to marry in the Catholic Church. It's not tolerance, this, not in the least.\n\nWe're taught to love, all of us, that's a Catholic teaching. But isn't it hypocritical to preach love and then turn away those who don't fit the mold? The practice, it seems, is stuck in the past, weighed down by its own history. Yet, they persist, like a stubborn mule.\n\nNow, about priests marrying, I think it might be a good idea. But I don't think it would stop the rotten apples from spoiling the barrel. They'd still seek out the weak, regardless of their marital status. It's not a matter of marriage, but of sin, and sin knows no priestly vows. A child is not a wife, and if a man is inclined to such darkness, he'll do it, marriage or no. Allowing priests to marry, I don't think it would change that. I think that evil, it's a beast that prowls the earth, and it will find its way into the Church, regardless.\n\nNo, I don't believe it would make a difference.",
            "Well, I reckon I ain't decided on this here matter yet. It's a ticklish subject, it is, right smack between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. Now, something so close to the bone, it's hard to tackle without hurtin' someone's feelings. But I do believe it's the trickiest topic we're grappling with today.\n\nNow, see, I ain't sure if the government should be shufflin' papers for couples getting hitched, seein' as how it's a sacrament to some folks. People don't get a tax break or any special treatment just 'cause they're baptized, do they? So, if you're married, why should it matter if it's a civil union or not? It's two people, come what may. The government don't need to look into what kind of ceremony it was, just that they're united.\n\nAnd gay marriage, well, it's just two people gettin' hitched, ain't it? Same as anyone else. If the states can come to a logical agreement, then I reckon we should push for it to be federal law. But amendin' the constitution just to ban it? That's like tryin' to nail Jell-O to the wall. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution, plain and simple.\n\nNo, that's not the way to go about it.",
            "In the crucible of my upbringing, the doctrine of Christianity was my guiding light. Yet, in my journey, I found myself in the company of souls who walked a different path, and thus, the question of the legitimacy of their love has been a trial of conscience. It is a matter of profound ambiguity, for I have known many who profess such affection, and it is not for me to pass judgment on the sanctity of their union.\n\nI hold no animosity towards these individuals, nor do I wish to see their rights curtailed. I believe that the law of the land should reflect the will of the governed, and in a nation of diverse beliefs and persuasions, it is folly to impose a singular creed upon all. The states, those independent entities forged in the fires of revolution, ought to be given the latitude to chart their own course on this matter. The president, a figure of authority but not omniscience, should not wield the power to dictate the moral compass of every state.\n\nA state's ethos is a reflection of its people, and it is their right to determine the contours of their society. The president's tenure is but a fleeting moment in the annals of history, while the decision of the people shall endure. To impose the will of one upon many is to sow discord, and it is not in the spirit of unity that we should strive. Let the states, those bastions of individuality, decide for themselves, and respect their judgment, for they are the keepers of their own destiny.",
            "Ah, now let's see here. What's this all about? A bulletin board, yes? A public thing, that's what it is. If you're posting on such a board, you're putting your words out there for all to see. That's just the way of it. But you're saying the school officials had no right to see such things? Well, let me tell you, if it's on the public internet, it's not just the school officials who will see it. It's anyone, anywhere. And if you're posting something that might lead to a safer school, well, I reckon that's more important than worrying about privacy.\n\nNow, I ain't saying they should be prowling around the internet just to catch students in the act. But if they stumble upon something that could make the school safer, well, that's their job. They're responsible for the safety of those students, aren't they? And if something like Columbine happens again, well, people will be looking for answers.\n\nBut I tell you, it's a big ol' world out there on the internet. Once you've put something out there, it's there forever. You can't take it back. It's like a ghost that haunts you. So, be careful what you post, that's all I'm saying. Be careful what you put out there, because it might just bite you in the behind someday.",
            "Well, alright then. The war in Iraq, it was a somethin' else. At first, I was all for it, you know? I mean, I was affected by September the eleventh, so I wanted to even the score, if you catch my meanin'. I'd have gone over there and made the place a real mess, just like they did to us. But I reckon we was blinded by the whole thing, didn't really think it through, just jumped in without a plan. And now, I don't know, I ain't for it no more. I don't think it's done a lick of good.\n\nI mean, look at 'em, they're always fightin' amongst themselves. If they can't get along, how in the hell are they gonna fight with us? I don't think us being over there is gonna change a thing. I don't care what happens over there no more. Them people, they're just not human. They can't even get along with themselves, so why should we even try to change their ways? We were just hyped up, I reckon, all emotion and anger. We went in there lookin' for revenge, and the President, he was just followin' the crowd. He thought he had to declare war, and I see where he was comin' from. But we didn't have a clear idea of what we were gonna do once we got there. We should've known better, had a plan, you know? But we didn't, and that's what we got.\n\nAnd now, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always gonna be the same. We ain't makin' enough progress, and it's not like we can stay there forever. No way, we're just hurtin' ourselves by stayin' over there. It's time to pull out, leave 'em be. They can sort their own mess out."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In this day and age, the Catholic Church finds itself at a crossroads, its once steadfast flock beginning to waver. The reasons for this, I believe, lie within the Church's unyielding stance on matters that have evolved with time. The institution has always been steadfast in its views on matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views, while firm and rooted in tradition, are not always in tune with the shifting sentiments of the modern world.\n\nThe Church's rigid stance on such issues has caused some to question its relevance and has led many to seek solace elsewhere. The younger generations, in particular, are turning away from the Church because they do not share its views on these subjects. The Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, can be a barrier for those who believe in the right to choose. Similarly, its stance against same-sex marriage can be a hurdle for those who wish to celebrate their love openly and legally.\n\nI am not advocating for the complete abandonment of these traditional views, but rather for a more nuanced approach that can accommodate the diverse beliefs and values of its followers. The Church's insistence that priests dedicate their lives to God, forsaking worldly pleasures and attachments, is a noble mission. However, it is not without its drawbacks. The Church's ban on marriage for priests, for example, can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which may not be conducive to the well-being of the clergy.\n\nThe Church's history is filled with tales of its leaders, both good and bad, and it is impossible to say with certainty whether a more permissive stance on marriage and female ordination would have prevented the scandals that have shaken the Church's foundations. It is a complex issue, one that cannot be simplified into a single solution. However, it is clear that the Church must engage with these questions openly and honestly, for the sake of its future.",
            "Well, now.\n\nMe, personally, I ain't got no problem with that here.\n\nSeems to me like it's not somethin' one can just choose, like a hat or a drink. Born that way, or whatever. Ain't no choice in the matter.\n\nSo, I reckon it's high time we stop holdin' folks accountable for somethin' they can't help, like the color of their eyes or the slope of their nose. Same goes for the way they're drawn to others. It's just the way they are, like the land or the weather. Ain't right to say one can and one can't, just 'cause they're different.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' I've give this here topic much thought. But I know what I know. And it seems to me like it's wrong to say a man can wed a woman, but two folks of the same stripe can't. Just don't make no sense.\n\nAnd the federal government? They got their hands full with the big stuff, like keepin' us safe and all. Ain't their place to meddle in folks' private lives and decisions. It's like a judge tryin' to teach a fly how to fly. Just don't work that way.\n\nSo, leave them be. They're just folks, same as the rest of us. Born that way, and they shouldn't be punished for it. That's all there is to it.",
            "I reckon that legalizing gay marriage is a notion that bears consideration, even if some see it as a threat to traditional unions. The arguments against it are many, yet they pale in comparison to the simple truth that love is love, regardless of whom it embraces. Many believe that homosexual couples are an abomination, a perversion of nature, but this is a stance born of ignorance and fear, not fact. The children of such unions, they say, will be raised in a shadow, their moral compass skewed by the unorthodox nature of their parents. But what of the countless studies that have shown no difference in the success of these unions compared to their heterosexual counterparts? The idea that gay couples will raise their children to be flawed, broken, is a fallacy. The role of a parent is not defined by their sexual orientation but by their love, guidance, and the values they instill in their children. The government, too, should not be a arbiter of such intimate matters. It is a matter of civil rights, of equality under the law. To deny one group these rights is to perpetuate segregation, separate but unequal. The federal government should step in, not to impose its will, but to ensure that all citizens are treated as such, regardless of who they choose to love. The moral high ground is not the exclusive domain of any one religion or culture. It is a shared responsibility, a collective effort to create a society that values compassion, understanding, and equality. To deny the rights of others based on their sexual orientation is to deny the very essence of what it means to be American.",
            "Well, first off, I tend the pharmacy over the summer, just like I tend to the dying in the night. Now, Jus' cause somethin' is illegal don't mean it ain't got its uses. I've seen the likes of oxycodone and vicodin run through here, and they're as beneficial as they are controlled. But I'd say, no, I'd say we shouldn't be just tossin' it out there for the public, like a pack of wild dogs. No, no, but for medicinal purposes? Absolutely, I'd say yes. Just 'cause a drug is illegal don't make it less so. It's not beneficial, no sir.\n\nYou see, there's a world of drugs out there, like a pack of wolves waitin' to be let loose. Oxycodone, vicodin, percocets, they're all just as dangerous as the next. But we use 'em 'cause they've got a purpose. And if you deny that purpose just 'cause there's a stigma 'round marijuana, well, that's like lettin' a good dog starve. You should embrace its benefits, I reckon.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's the same as alcohol, but neither is it nothin' like heroine or cocaine. It's just... different.

            "Well, the church has seen a shift in the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it once was. When I was younger, I'd go every Sunday, dressed in cute little dresses and matching shoes, seeing all my friends in the same attire. Now, they've introduced a teenager's mass, cut down to thirty minutes, and the dress code has relaxed significantly. People show up in beachwear during summer, families come late, and even the morning masses have seen a casual turn. People wear jeans and khakis now, which, to be honest, is quite practical but far removed from the pristine outfits of old. As for the church's politics or the scandals involving priests, I don't know the ins and outs, but I don't think changes like allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the pedophilia accusations. Men who are married can still be attracted to children, and it's not just a matter of being allowed or not. It's a matter of wanting to serve the church and potentially not being suited for it. There are other faiths that allow marriage, so those who want to practice their faith and be married should consider other paths. I believe the attraction to children is often genetic and not entirely a result of upbringing. You can't change someone's genetics through marriage, and if they know about it and cover it up, that's shameful, but I think not all instances were known. Other than that, I have no further thoughts on the matter.",
            "It was all well and good at first, I suppose. But with the echoes of September eleventh still ringing in our ears, we found ourselves in a land far from our shores, waging war on a premise that would soon unravel like a cheap tapestry. The Iraq war, a specter that haunts our collective consciousness, was a pretext, a mirage that led us astray. The Bush administration, with its litany of falsehoods, weaved a web of deceit, asserting that Saddam Hussein's regime was a threat, that weapons of mass destruction lurked within his grasp. Yet, the truth was as elusive as the morning mist, and the arm of justice has yet to reach out and grasp the Bush administration's neck.\n\nColin Powell, once a voice of authority, now echoes in the chambers of shame, confessing his doubts, his misgivings. He, like many, believed the lies, the half-truths, the deceptions. The Constitution, a sacred text, was trampled upon, its words twisted, its intent derided. The Bush administration, it seems, entered office with a dark purpose, a vengeance that burned like a fever, a desire to expand, to control.\n\nThe war drags on, a festering wound on the face of humanity. Withdrawal, a thought that sends a shiver down the spine, would be akin to leaving a child in the dark, a lamb in the jaws of a wolf. Civil war, a specter that looms large, would take its toll, a harvest of blood and tears. The coalition, a motley crew of nations, would step into the breach, but can they restore order in a land where the very fabric of government dissolves like sand between our fingers?\n\nThe interim government, a fragile construct, crumbles under the weight of its own instability. The Prime Minister, a shadow of his former self, struggles to maintain control over the political process, a raging river that threatens to sweep him away. The Parliament, a fractious body, is but a reflection of the chaos that reigns. And the radicals, those who once fought against us, now hold sway, a testament to the turmoil that grips the heart of Iraq.\n\nNone of this is the world we wanted to see. Yet, it is the world we inhabit, a land of shadows and uncertainty.",
            "I did just as the wind does, in a breath. Aye, there's the matter of the Iraq War. I reckon it's become a point of contention, like a bone between two hounds. The war, it wasn't declared by Congress, you see. It was a matter of retribution, a strike against them who we figured planted the seeds of the eleven's horror. Now, I ain't one to keep track of such things, but I know we're there to build a democracy, to mold 'em in our image. Oil, too, plays its part, but I think it's a fool's errand. They're a people with a different way, and we're trying to force our hand upon them. It's like trying to bend a river, it only serves to create a flood. We should withdraw, let's not prolong their agony and our own. It's a tricky thing, this war. It's not fair, but it's a fact. We should let them find their own way, not force our own upon them.

            "I don't see fit to make it so, for the state to declare it legal, or even to legalize it at all. I believe the churches should have their say, as the Constitution itself stands witness to the separation of church and state. It is plainly stated, and I believe any attempt to wield power over it would be tantamount to defying what has been written in stone. In the eyes of those who seek to make it illegal, it seems they are imposing one belief over another, as the majority of Catholics and Christians are against it, save for a few pockets like Boston. I don't see it as the government's place to decide what is legal and illegal for the churches. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our Constitution, a beacon for religious tolerance. To add an amendment on this matter would be a contradiction to what is already in place, and quite possibly the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. It is not right. I do not believe the federal government, nor any government, should involve itself in this matter. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, revealing a preference for one religion over others. This is not a matter for the president or any government official. There is no sound reasoning behind this amendment save for personal views. It won't impact the economy, and I believe it could even have a positive impact on society. I've said my piece.",
            "The war in Iraq... It began with a lie, a deceit woven into the very fabric of our nation's decision to march into that foreign land. The government, they said, had weapons of mass destruction, a threat to our very existence. But it was a lie, a tale spun to rouse the emotions of a people still raw from the scars of September 11th. The government, they said, would liberate the Iraqis, bring them democracy. Yet, they were not prepared, not at all.\n\nThe war was a repeat, a echo of the Vietnam War, a war of insurgents and citizen soldiers. The government, they should have known better, should have learned from the past. But they were blind, blinded by the oil, blinded by the money. They removed the government, but they were not ready for what came next, the chaos, the void of power. They tried to plant democracy, but it was a long and hard process, a process that our own country had struggled through, a struggle of tension and civil war.\n\nAnd now, years later, we are still there, still dying, still trying to train the Iraqis, to teach them how to police their own country. The government, they were not prepared, not at all. They tried to deceive us, make us believe it would be a quick and easy victory. But it was not, it was a long and hard battle, a battle that was not won, not truly won.\n\nThe war in Iraq, it was a difficult decision, a decision that still weighs heavily on my mind. I would have voted for Bush, to let him finish what he started. But now, how can we abandon them? We took their government, their way of life. How can we abandon them now? But there is also the consideration, the awful consideration of the American casualties, the American blood spilled for a cause that would never truly be won.\n\nAnd the oil, the oil, it was the reason, the true reason. It was all about the money, the resources. It was not about democracy, not truly. Why Iraq and not North Korea, with their weapons of mass destruction? It was the oil, the oil that fueled our decisions, that guided our hands.\n\nLet the war end, let the peace come. But it will not be soon, not truly.",
            "Well, now, let's see here. I reckon I've always been in favor of the notion of gay marriage. It's a personal thing, plain and simple. I think it's a matter of biology more than sociology, and denying folks the right to marry based on something they can't control seems plain inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for it, you see.\n\nI don't think politics or the government ought to have a say in it. It's a personal affair, not something the state or federal government needs to be involved with. Look at my neighborhood, for instance. We've got a couple of openly gay couples, and they're just like any other family. They walk their dogs, tend to their gardens, and mind their own business. It's just the way it ought to be.\n\nNow, I've read and heard from numerous sources that there's a biological aspect to being homosexual. It's not just about growing up in a certain environment or having a certain upbringing. It's something innate, something that's been proven time and time again.\n\nAnd let's talk about marriage, shall we? If a man and a woman want to get hitched, they can just up and do it without telling a soul. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's front-page news. I think that's just wrong. Marriage should be a private matter, not something for the public or the government to dictate.\n\nNo, I don't think it's right to deny folks the right to marry because of their sexual orientation. It's a personal choice, and it's nobody else's business.",

You can't just go spewing whatever you please about blowing things up or shootings, think about it. Someone's gonna take it the wrong way. The internet's a public forum, and you can't control how people interpret your words. It's like a wildfire, once it starts, there's no telling where it'll end up.\n\nI've seen it myself, where someone overhears something at school and goes running to the authorities. They can't just let it be, not when lives are on the line. But here's the thing, you can't tell what's real and what's just fooling around. It could be a sociology experiment gone wrong, or it could be a real threat. One time, we had someone who was overheard saying something, and when we looked into it, we found they had posted things on their Facebook that seemed serious, even if they were meant as jokes. You can't predict how people will react.\n\nNow, I ain't saying schools should be snooping on students' social media accounts. But if something's brought to their attention, they've got a duty to take it seriously. It's about safety, plain and simple. If it's a real threat, they can't just ignore it. And as for teachers, they shouldn't be sneaking around on social media, pretending to be someone they ain't. That's just creepy. But if a student brings something to their attention, that's different. They've given them access to their online world, and it's only right they take it seriously.\n\nSo, my advice? Think before you post. Don't put things out there that you don't want people to see. Because once it's out there, it's out there. And you can't control what people think or how they react. It's like writing in the sand, you never know who might see it, or how they'll interpret it.",
            "In the quietude of the American night, the war drags on, a relentless river of blood and sand. It was a noble purpose, once, to restore democracy to a land shrouded in tyranny. But as the years bleed into one another, the original intent fades, like a ghost in the desert sun. We wage this conflict now, not for the sake of freedom, but to prove our might, to be the unchallenged colossus of the world. And what of Motive? Who can say if the embers of our resolve were not fanned by the ghosts of old debts, the embers of George Bush Senior's enmity with Saddam Hussein? If the purpose was to bestow democracy on a land devoid of fair governance, then so be it. But if personal grievances were the true currency, then we find ourselves adrift, drunk on the blood of innocents.\n\nWe have sent our purpose into the world, like a clarion call, in the first months of this war. But now, as the years stretch on, the clarity of that purpose dissolves. This is not a war of principle, but a war of will, a stubborn refusal to admit defeat or concede defeat. We do not want to retreat, tarnished and battered, without a decisive end, a final, triumphant cry.\n\nThe war has gone on long enough. Too long. The government of Iraq must now stand on its own, as we once did. Our resources are not endless, and every dollar spent on this foreign conflict is a dollar not spent on our own war, the war against poverty, the war to heal our own lands. The roads that crumble, the schools that fail, the hospitals that lack, they are the battlegrounds of our time, and they deserve more than the crumbs we offer them.\n\nWe have spent billions, and the war is not something to be woven into the fabric of our budget, like a decoration on a grand tapestry. There are battles to be fought at home, and they need our attention, our resources, our resolve. We cannot afford to bleed on foreign soil while our own needs go unmet. For in the end, it is our own land that will bear the scars of this war, our own people who will feel the sting of our withdrawal, our own economy that will recoil from the drain of this endless struggle.",
            "Can I inquire, perhaps, if I might clarify a matter?\n\nI suppose the fact is, it was averted through the intervention of an individual who, by happenstance, chanced upon the information online.\n\nWell, now, that's the crux of the matter, ain't it? If one chooses to put forth personal tidings on the internet, then it's fair to say the world may as well have a peek.\n\nTake Myspace, for instance. You see, it's no secret that to view another's profile, one must first accept them as a \"friend.\" It's a covenant, if you will. But once that bond is forged, it's akin to giving them a key to your own personal sanctum.\n\nNow, it's a curious conundrum, isn't it? For we know well that by sharing our lives online, we invite a multitude of eyes to gaze upon our secrets. And who can say if any of those eyes may harbor ill intent?\n\nI, myself, have not delved into the realms of Myspace, but Facebook, now that's a different matter. I'll wager it's akin to walking through a market square, where one can't help but catch a glimpse of the wares laid bare for all to see.\n\nIt troubles me, this knowledge that there are those who lurk in the shadows, snooping about like vultures. I've heard tales of men who, with naught but a few clicks, can unmask your true name and weave a web of deceit. It's a precarious dance, this life in the digital age.\n\nI've come across instances where individuals in my classes, whose faces I know not, have sent me messages, knowing full well who I am. They have seen my interests laid bare, my daily schedule laid out like a map. It's a disquieting feeling, to know that one's most private thoughts are accessible to the public.\n\nBut I suppose there's a balance to be struck. For while I limit what I share, I also wish to remain connected with those I hold dear. It's a delicate line to walk, this journey through the digital frontier.\n\nI've heard tell that in some high schools, they've forbidden students from having Myspace accounts altogether. It strikes me as a peculiar notion, that those who ought to be guiding us could dictate what we may or may not do in our personal lives.\n\nI reckon it's a matter of privacy, and perhaps a question of power. But I'm not one to speak on such matters with any certainty. It's a world that's ever-changing, this digital realm, and we're but mere pioneers, forging our way through uncharted territories.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and then one more time that I must speak on the Iraq War\nUm\nYes\nI mean, I feel hypocritical discussing it\nI mean, I hate to say, you know\nI hate to join the bandwagon of those who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but like it’s not really important anymore\nCause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t care to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nThey’ve done Iraqi polls\nThey’ve done global polls\nAnd I mean, no, like about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops that are over there\nLike the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in\nIt was already a disaster\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s just too big a gap and for administrations past and present to understand\nAnd they think that they can just like bring Democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean, sure Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s arguing that he’s not\nBut, I mean, you have to weight the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to\nYou know turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these\nThese are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know, if it completely goes to shit we could be like well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean, if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than you know where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Damn, the world's still a godforsaken mess when it comes to how we treat each other based on our sex. It's a long road to walk, full of hard knocks and twisted paths. Men and women, we're all just trying to carve out a place for ourselves, but the game's rigged, and the deck's stacked against us.\n\nTake, for instance, the business world. It's still a man's world, and women have to walk a mile in their shoes just to prove they're worth their salt. They've got the qualifications, the brains, and the guts, but the board won't budge, not because they're not good enough, but because society's still stuck in the dusty past. The glass ceiling's still up there, and it's not about to shatter anytime soon.\n\nAnd it's not just about women. Men, too, have their own battles to fight. In fields like fashion, where the world's already got a certain image in its mind, men can't break the mold. They're met with raised eyebrows and skeptical glances. \"How can a man know fashion?\" they'll ask. \"Isn't that a woman's thing?\"\n\nSociety's mindset's like a stubborn mule, and changing it's no easy task. It's a slow, painful process, but we're making progress. Women are rising to the top, taking on CEO positions, and it's starting to click for some people. Men staying at home, raising the kids, it's not the norm, but it's becoming more accepted. They're realizing, hey, maybe the woman's the breadwinner this time around.\n\nBut the fight's not just about sex. It's about class, about where you come from. A man from a farm, with his hands calloused and his grammar rough, he's got to fight twice as hard to prove he's got what it takes. Other men, they won't look at him straight, not with his words all twisted up. It's a goddamn shame, but it's the truth.\n\nWe've come a long way, but the road's far from over. Change's a slow, steady thing, like the tide coming in. It's not about forcing it, it's about showing the good in people, the qualities that make them shine. It's about patience, about time. And hope, too. We've got to keep fighting, keep pushing, keep chipping away at the old ways. Because, dammit, we deserve better. We all do.",
            "Well,\nThey didn't so much legalize it as they did decriminalize it. Knocked it down from a criminal offense, like a pebble tumbling from a mountain to a mere traffic infraction. A citation, a slap on the wrist, rather than the cuffs and the cell. As the kid put it, \"a ticket's what you get now, not a trip to the lockup.\" And I reckon that's where the real trouble starts. Job interviews, college applications, all those future prospects tainted by a mark on your record. A stain harder to wash out than blood from the floorboards of a saloon. But there's more to it than that. Costs money, it does, to arrest someone, book 'em, feed 'em, defend 'em. And then there's the court, the lawyers, the whole circus. A municipality on the brink, how much can they afford to spend on something like this? And then there's the philosophies, the morals, the \"liberal\" sentiments. Denver, it's different there. More open, more money to spend on education, social programs, aid for the poor. But it ain't for everyone. Marijuana, it's not something you want everywhere, all the time. It's a tricky business, this legalization. It's like trying to tame a storm. Some folks say it's a slippery slope, others say it's long overdue. But one thing's for sure, it's a storm that's brewing. And the wind's picking up.",
            "I would say yes, for the sake of tradition, yes, but also for the sake of adaptability, yes. A lot of the Catholic ways are as old as the hills, deeply rooted and unchanged for centuries. And I suppose tradition, well, it's like the roots of an ancient oak - it keeps us grounded. But we must also be like the willow, bending with the wind, adapting to change. Yet, there are those who cling to the doctrine like a drowning man to a splinter.\n\nMany a Catholic believes they must attend church weekly, and they're rigid in their rituals. The Church, it seems, doesn't take kindly to those who deviate from the straight and narrow. They turn away those who aren't perfect, and those of other religions, it seems, are as unwelcome as a stranger in a strange land. My own parents, my father an Episcopalian, my mother a Catholic, they weren't allowed to marry in the Catholic Church. It's not tolerance, this, not in the least.\n\nWe're taught to love, all of us, that's a Catholic teaching. But isn't it hypocritical to preach love and then turn away those who don't fit the mold? The practice, it seems, is stuck in the past, weighed down by its own history. Yet, they persist, like a stubborn mule.\n\nNow, about priests marrying, I think it might be a good idea. But I don't think it would stop the rotten apples from spoiling the barrel. They'd still seek out the weak, regardless of their marital status. It's not a matter of marriage, but of sin, and sin knows no priestly vows. A child is not a wife, and if a man is inclined to such darkness, he'll do it, marriage or no. Allowing priests to marry, I don't think it would change that. I think that evil, it's a beast that prowls the earth, and it will find its way into the Church, regardless.\n\nNo, I don't believe it would make a difference.",
            "Well, I reckon I ain't decided on this here matter yet. It's a ticklish subject, it is, right smack between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. Now, something so close to the bone, it's hard to tackle without hurtin' someone's feelings. But I do believe it's the trickiest topic we're grappling with today.\n\nNow, see, I ain't sure if the government should be shufflin' papers for couples getting hitched, seein' as how it's a sacrament to some folks. People don't get a tax break or any special treatment just 'cause they're baptized, do they? So, if you're married, why should it matter if it's a civil union or not? It's two people, come what may. The government don't need to look into what kind of ceremony it was, just that they're united.\n\nAnd gay marriage, well, it's just two people gettin' hitched, ain't it? Same as anyone else. If the states can come to a logical agreement, then I reckon we should push for it to be federal law. But amendin' the constitution just to ban it? That's like tryin' to nail Jell-O to the wall. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution, plain and simple.\n\nNo, that's not the way to go about it.",
            "In the crucible of my upbringing, the doctrine of Christianity was my guiding light. Yet, in my journey, I found myself in the company of souls who walked a different path, and thus, the question of the legitimacy of their love has been a trial of conscience. It is a matter of profound ambiguity, for I have known many who profess such affection, and it is not for me to pass judgment on the sanctity of their union.\n\nI hold no animosity towards these individuals, nor do I wish to see their rights curtailed. I believe that the law of the land should reflect the will of the governed, and in a nation of diverse beliefs and persuasions, it is folly to impose a singular creed upon all. The states, those independent entities forged in the fires of revolution, ought to be given the latitude to chart their own course on this matter. The president, a figure of authority but not omniscience, should not wield the power to dictate the moral compass of every state.\n\nA state's ethos is a reflection of its people, and it is their right to determine the contours of their society. The president's tenure is but a fleeting moment in the annals of history, while the decision of the people shall endure. To impose the will of one upon many is to sow discord, and it is not in the spirit of unity that we should strive. Let the states, those bastions of individuality, decide for themselves, and respect their judgment, for they are the keepers of their own destiny.",
            "Ah, now let's see here. What's this all about? A bulletin board, yes? A public thing, that's what it is. If you're posting on such a board, you're putting your words out there for all to see. That's just the way of it. But you're saying the school officials had no right to see such things? Well, let me tell you, if it's on the public internet, it's not just the school officials who will see it. It's anyone, anywhere. And if you're posting something that might lead to a safer school, well, I reckon that's more important than worrying about privacy.\n\nNow, I ain't saying they should be prowling around the internet just to catch students in the act. But if they stumble upon something that could make the school safer, well, that's their job. They're responsible for the safety of those students, aren't they? And if something like Columbine happens again, well, people will be looking for answers.\n\nBut I tell you, it's a big ol' world out there on the internet. Once you've put something out there, it's there forever. You can't take it back. It's like a ghost that haunts you. So, be careful what you post, that's all I'm saying. Be careful what you put out there, because it might just bite you in the behind someday.",
            "Well, alright then. The war in Iraq, it was a somethin' else. At first, I was all for it, you know? I mean, I was affected by September the eleventh, so I wanted to even the score, if you catch my meanin'. I'd have gone over there and made the place a real mess, just like they did to us. But I reckon we was blinded by the whole thing, didn't really think it through, just jumped in without a plan. And now, I don't know, I ain't for it no more. I don't think it's done a lick of good.\n\nI mean, look at 'em, they're always fightin' amongst themselves. If they can't get along, how in the hell are they gonna fight with us? I don't think us being over there is gonna change a thing. I don't care what happens over there no more. Them people, they're just not human. They can't even get along with themselves, so why should we even try to change their ways? We were just hyped up, I reckon, all emotion and anger. We went in there lookin' for revenge, and the President, he was just followin' the crowd. He thought he had to declare war, and I see where he was comin' from. But we didn't have a clear idea of what we were gonna do once we got there. We should've known better, had a plan, you know? But we didn't, and that's what we got.\n\nAnd now, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always gonna be the same. We ain't makin' enough progress, and it's not like we can stay there forever. No way, we're just hurtin' ourselves by stayin' over there. It's time to pull out, leave 'em be. They can sort their own mess out."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In this day and age, the Catholic Church finds itself at a crossroads, its once steadfast flock beginning to waver. The reasons for this, I believe, lie within the Church's unyielding stance on matters that have evolved with time. The institution has always been steadfast in its views on matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views, while firm and rooted in tradition, are not always in tune with the shifting sentiments of the modern world.\n\nThe Church's rigid stance on such issues has caused some to question its relevance and has led many to seek solace elsewhere. The younger generations, in particular, are turning away from the Church because they do not share its views on these subjects. The Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, can be a barrier for those who believe in the right to choose. Similarly, its stance against same-sex marriage can be a hurdle for those who wish to celebrate their love openly and legally.\n\nI am not advocating for the complete abandonment of these traditional views, but rather for a more nuanced approach that can accommodate the diverse beliefs and values of its followers. The Church's insistence that priests dedicate their lives to God, forsaking worldly pleasures and attachments, is a noble mission. However, it is not without its drawbacks. The Church's ban on marriage for priests, for example, can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which may not be conducive to the well-being of the clergy.\n\nThe Church's history is filled with tales of its leaders, both good and bad, and it is impossible to say with certainty whether a more permissive stance on marriage and female ordination would have prevented the scandals that have shaken the Church's foundations. It is a complex issue, one that cannot be simplified into a single solution. However, it is clear that the Church must engage with these questions openly and honestly, for the sake of its future.",

Same goes for the way they're drawn to others. It's just the way they are, like the land or the weather. Ain't right to say one can and one can't, just 'cause they're different.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' I've give this here topic much thought. But I know what I know. And it seems to me like it's wrong to say a man can wed a woman, but two folks of the same stripe can't. Just don't make no sense.\n\nAnd the federal government?

            "I reckon that legalizing gay marriage is a notion that bears consideration, even if some see it as a threat to traditional unions. The arguments against it are many, yet they pale in comparison to the simple truth that love is love, regardless of whom it embraces. Many believe that homosexual couples are an abomination, a perversion of nature, but this is a stance born of ignorance and fear, not fact. The children of such unions, they say, will be raised in a shadow, their moral compass skewed by the unorthodox nature of their parents. But what of the countless studies that have shown no difference in the success of these unions compared to their heterosexual counterparts? The idea that gay couples will raise their children to be flawed, broken, is a fallacy. The role of a parent is not defined by their sexual orientation but by their love, guidance, and the values they instill in their children. The government, too, should not be a arbiter of such intimate matters. It is a matter of civil rights, of equality under the law. To deny one group these rights is to perpetuate segregation, separate but unequal. The federal government should step in, not to impose its will, but to ensure that all citizens are treated as such, regardless of who they choose to love. The moral high ground is not the exclusive domain of any one religion or culture. It is a shared responsibility, a collective effort to create a society that values compassion, understanding, and equality. To deny the rights of others based on their sexual orientation is to deny the very essence of what it means to be American.",
            "Well, first off, I tend the pharmacy over the summer, just like I tend to the dying in the night. Now, Jus' cause somethin' is illegal don't mean it ain't got its uses.

            "Well, the church has seen a shift in the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it once was. When I was younger, I'd go every Sunday, dressed in cute little dresses and matching shoes, seeing all my friends in the same attire. Now, they've introduced a teenager's mass, cut down to thirty minutes, and the dress code has relaxed significantly. People show up in beachwear during summer, families come late, and even the morning masses have seen a casual turn. People wear jeans and khakis now, which, to be honest, is quite practical but far removed from the pristine outfits of old. As for the church's politics or the scandals involving priests, I don't know the ins and outs, but I don't think changes like allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the pedophilia accusations. Men who are married can still be attracted to children, and it's not just a matter of being allowed or not. It's a matter of wanting to serve the church and potentially not being suited for it. There are other faiths that allow marriage, so those who want to practice their faith and be married should consider other paths. I believe the attraction to children is often genetic and not entirely a result of upbringing. You can't change someone's genetics through marriage, and if they know about it and cover it up, that's shameful, but I think not all instances were known. Other than that, I have no further thoughts on the matter.",
            "It was all well and good at first, I suppose. But with the echoes of September eleventh still ringing in our ears, we found ourselves in a land far from our shores, waging war on a premise that would soon unravel like a cheap tapestry. The Iraq war, a specter that haunts our collective consciousness, was a pretext, a mirage that led us astray. The Bush administration, with its litany of falsehoods, weaved a web of deceit, asserting that Saddam Hussein's regime was a threat, that weapons of mass destruction lurked within his grasp. Yet, the truth was as elusive as the morning mist, and the arm of justice has yet to reach out and grasp the Bush administration's neck.\n\nColin Powell, once a voice of authority, now echoes in the chambers of shame, confessing his doubts, his misgivings. He, like many, believed the lies, the half-truths, the deceptions. The Constitution, a sacred text, was trampled upon, its words twisted, its intent derided. The Bush administration, it seems, entered office with a dark purpose, a vengeance that burned like a fever, a desire to expand, to control.\n\nThe war drags on, a festering wound on the face of humanity. Withdrawal, a thought that sends a shiver down the spine, would be akin to leaving a child in the dark, a lamb in the jaws of a wolf. Civil war, a specter that looms large, would take its toll, a harvest of blood and tears. The coalition, a motley crew of nations, would step into the breach, but can they restore order in a land where the very fabric of government dissolves like sand between our fingers?\n\nThe interim government, a fragile construct, crumbles under the weight of its own instability. The Prime Minister, a shadow of his former self, struggles to maintain control over the political process, a raging river that threatens to sweep him away. The Parliament, a fractious body, is but a reflection of the chaos that reigns. And the radicals, those who once fought against us, now hold sway, a testament to the turmoil that grips the heart of Iraq.\n\nNone of this is the world we wanted to see. Yet, it is the world we inhabit, a land of shadows and uncertainty.",
            "I did just as the wind does, in a breath. Aye, there's the matter of the Iraq War. I reckon it's become a point of contention, like a bone between two hounds. The war, it wasn't declared by Congress, you see. It was a matter of retribution, a strike against them who we figured planted the seeds of the eleven's horror. Now, I ain't one to keep track of such things, but I know we're there to build a democracy, to mold 'em in our image. Oil, too, plays its part, but I think it's a fool's errand. They're a people with a different way, and we're trying to force our hand upon them. It's like trying to bend a river, it only serves to create a flood. We should withdraw, let's not prolong their agony and our own. It's a tricky thing, this war. It's not fair, but it's a fact. We should let them find their own way, not force our own upon them.

            "I don't see fit to make it so, for the state to declare it legal, or even to legalize it at all. I believe the churches should have their say, as the Constitution itself stands witness to the separation of church and state. It is plainly stated, and I believe any attempt to wield power over it would be tantamount to defying what has been written in stone. In the eyes of those who seek to make it illegal, it seems they are imposing one belief over another, as the majority of Catholics and Christians are against it, save for a few pockets like Boston. I don't see it as the government's place to decide what is legal and illegal for the churches. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our Constitution, a beacon for religious tolerance. To add an amendment on this matter would be a contradiction to what is already in place, and quite possibly the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. It is not right. I do not believe the federal government, nor any government, should involve itself in this matter. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, revealing a preference for one religion over others. This is not a matter for the president or any government official. There is no sound reasoning behind this amendment save for personal views. It won't impact the economy, and I believe it could even have a positive impact on society. I've said my piece.",

The government, they said, had weapons of mass destruction, a threat to our very existence. But it was a lie, a tale spun to rouse the emotions of a people still raw from the scars of September 11th. The government, they said, would liberate the Iraqis, bring them democracy. Yet, they were not prepared, not at all.\n\nThe war was a repeat, a echo of the Vietnam War, a war of insurgents and citizen soldiers. The government, they should have known better, should have learned from the past. But they were blind, blinded by the oil, blinded by the money. They removed the government, but they were not ready for what came next, the chaos, the void of power. They tried to plant democracy, but it was a long and hard process, a process that our own country had struggled through, a struggle of tension and civil war.\n\nAnd now, years later, we are still there, still dying, still trying to train the Iraqis, to teach them how to police their own country. The government, they were not prepared, not at all. They tried to deceive us, make us believe it would be a quick and easy victory. But it was not, it was a long and hard battle, a battle that was not won, not truly won.\n\nThe war in Iraq, it was a difficult decision, a decision that still weighs heavily on my mind. I would have voted for Bush, to let him finish what he started. But now, how can we abandon them? We took their government, their way of life. How can we abandon them now? But there is also the consideration, the awful consideration of the American casualties, the American blood spilled for a cause that would never truly be won.\n\nAnd the oil, the oil, it was the reason, the true reason. It was all about the money, the resources. It was not about democracy, not truly. Why Iraq and not North Korea, with their weapons of mass destruction? It was the oil, the oil that fueled our decisions, that guided our hands.\n\nLet the war end, let the peace come. But it will not be soon, not truly.",
            "Well, now, let's see here. I reckon I've always been in favor of the notion of gay marriage. It's a personal thing, plain and simple. I think it's a matter of biology more than sociology, and denying folks the right to marry based on something they can't control seems plain inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for it, you see.\n\nI don't think politics or the government ought to have a say in it. It's a personal affair, not something the state or federal government needs to be involved with. Look at my neighborhood, for instance. We've got a couple of openly gay couples, and they're just like any other family. They walk their dogs, tend to their gardens, and mind their own business. It's just the way it ought to be.\n\nNow, I've read and heard from numerous sources that there's a biological aspect to being homosexual. It's not just about growing up in a certain environment or having a certain upbringing. It's something innate, something that's been proven time and time again.\n\nAnd let's talk about marriage, shall we? If a man and a woman want to get hitched, they can just up and do it without telling a soul. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's front-page news. I think that's just wrong. Marriage should be a private matter, not something for the public or the government to dictate.\n\nNo, I don't think it's right to deny folks the right to marry because of their sexual orientation. It's a personal choice, and it's nobody else's business.",
            "Well, I reckon once something hits the internet, it's as good as out in the open. There ain't no hiding from that. Now, as a resident assistant, I've seen firsthand what can happen when folks put things online. It ain't just the school, mind you, but anyone with a connection can see what you've written. You can't just go spewing whatever you please about blowing things up or shootings, think about it. Someone's gonna take it the wrong way. The internet's a public forum, and you can't control how people interpret your words. It's like a wildfire, once it starts, there's no telling where it'll end up.\n\nI've seen it myself, where someone overhears something at school and goes running to the authorities. They can't just let it be, not when lives are on the line. But here's the thing, you can't tell what's real and what's just fooling around. It could be a sociology experiment gone wrong, or it could be a real threat. One time, we had someone who was overheard saying something, and when we looked into it, we found they had posted things on their Facebook that seemed serious, even if they were meant as jokes. You can't predict how people will react.\n\nNow, I ain't saying schools should be snooping on students' social media accounts. But if something's brought to their attention, they've got a duty to take it seriously. It's about safety, plain and simple. If it's a real threat, they can't just ignore it. And as for teachers, they shouldn't be sneaking around on social media, pretending to be someone they ain't. That's just creepy. But if a student brings something to their attention, that's different. They've given them access to their online world, and it's only right they take it seriously.\n\nSo, my advice? Think before you post. Don't put things out there that you don't want people to see. Because once it's out there, it's out there. And you can't control what people think or how they react. It's like writing in the sand, you never know who might see it, or how they'll interpret it.",
            "In the quietude of the American night, the war drags on, a relentless river of blood and sand. It was a noble purpose, once, to restore democracy to a land shrouded in tyranny. But as the years bleed into one another, the original intent fades, like a ghost in the desert sun. We wage this conflict now, not for the sake of freedom, but to prove our might, to be the unchallenged colossus of the world. And what of Motive? Who can say if the embers of our resolve were not fanned by the ghosts of old debts, the embers of George Bush Senior's enmity with Saddam Hussein? If the purpose was to bestow democracy on a land devoid of fair governance, then so be it. But if personal grievances were the true currency, then we find ourselves adrift, drunk on the blood of innocents.\n\nWe have sent our purpose into the world, like a clarion call, in the first months of this war. But now, as the years stretch on, the clarity of that purpose dissolves. This is not a war of principle, but a war of will, a stubborn refusal to admit defeat or concede defeat. We do not want to retreat, tarnished and battered, without a decisive end, a final, triumphant cry.\n\nThe war has gone on long enough. Too long. The government of Iraq must now stand on its own, as we once did. Our resources are not endless, and every dollar spent on this foreign conflict is a dollar not spent on our own war, the war against poverty, the war to heal our own lands. The roads that crumble, the schools that fail, the hospitals that lack, they are the battlegrounds of our time, and they deserve more than the crumbs we offer them.\n\nWe have spent billions, and the war is not something to be woven into the fabric of our budget, like a decoration on a grand tapestry. There are battles to be fought at home, and they need our attention, our resources, our resolve. We cannot afford to bleed on foreign soil while our own needs go unmet. For in the end, it is our own land that will bear the scars of this war, our own people who will feel the sting of our withdrawal, our own economy that will recoil from the drain of this endless struggle.",
            "Can I inquire, perhaps, if I might clarify a matter?\n\nI suppose the fact is, it was averted through the intervention of an individual who, by happenstance, chanced upon the information online.\n\nWell, now, that's the crux of the matter, ain't it? If one chooses to put forth personal tidings on the internet, then it's fair to say the world may as well have a peek.\n\nTake Myspace, for instance. You see, it's no secret that to view another's profile, one must first accept them as a \"friend.\" It's a covenant, if you will. But once that bond is forged, it's akin to giving them a key to your own personal sanctum.\n\nNow, it's a curious conundrum, isn't it? For we know well that by sharing our lives online, we invite a multitude of eyes to gaze upon our secrets. And who can say if any of those eyes may harbor ill intent?\n\nI, myself, have not delved into the realms of Myspace, but Facebook, now that's a different matter. I'll wager it's akin to walking through a market square, where one can't help but catch a glimpse of the wares laid bare for all to see.\n\nIt troubles me, this knowledge that there are those who lurk in the shadows, snooping about like vultures. I've heard tales of men who, with naught but a few clicks, can unmask your true name and weave a web of deceit. It's a precarious dance, this life in the digital age.\n\nI've come across instances where individuals in my classes, whose faces I know not, have sent me messages, knowing full well who I am. They have seen my interests laid bare, my daily schedule laid out like a map. It's a disquieting feeling, to know that one's most private thoughts are accessible to the public.\n\nBut I suppose there's a balance to be struck. For while I limit what I share, I also wish to remain connected with those I hold dear. It's a delicate line to walk, this journey through the digital frontier.\n\nI've heard tell that in some high schools, they've forbidden students from having Myspace accounts altogether. It strikes me as a peculiar notion, that those who ought to be guiding us could dictate what we may or may not do in our personal lives.\n\nI reckon it's a matter of privacy, and perhaps a question of power. But I'm not one to speak on such matters with any certainty. It's a world that's ever-changing, this digital realm, and we're but mere pioneers, forging our way through uncharted territories.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and then one more time that I must speak on the Iraq War\nUm\nYes\nI mean, I feel hypocritical discussing it\nI mean, I hate to say, you know\nI hate to join the bandwagon of those who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but like it’s not really important anymore\nCause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t care to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nThey’ve done Iraqi polls\nThey’ve done global polls\nAnd I mean, no, like about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops that are over there\nLike the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in\nIt was already a disaster\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s just too big a gap and for administrations past and present to understand\nAnd they think that they can just like bring Democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean, sure Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s arguing that he’s not\nBut, I mean, you have to weight the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to\nYou know turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these\nThese are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know, if it completely goes to shit we could be like well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean, if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than you know where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Damn, the world's still a godforsaken mess when it comes to how we treat each other based on our sex. It's a long road to walk, full of hard knocks and twisted paths. Men and women, we're all just trying to carve out a place for ourselves, but the game's rigged, and the deck's stacked against us.\n\nTake, for instance, the business world. It's still a man's world, and women have to walk a mile in their shoes just to prove they're worth their salt. They've got the qualifications, the brains, and the guts, but the board won't budge, not because they're not good enough, but because society's still stuck in the dusty past. The glass ceiling's still up there, and it's not about to shatter anytime soon.\n\nAnd it's not just about women. Men, too, have their own battles to fight. In fields like fashion, where the world's already got a certain image in its mind, men can't break the mold. They're met with raised eyebrows and skeptical glances. \"How can a man know fashion?\" they'll ask. \"Isn't that a woman's thing?\"\n\nSociety's mindset's like a stubborn mule, and changing it's no easy task. It's a slow, painful process, but we're making progress. Women are rising to the top, taking on CEO positions, and it's starting to click for some people. Men staying at home, raising the kids, it's not the norm, but it's becoming more accepted. They're realizing, hey, maybe the woman's the breadwinner this time around.\n\nBut the fight's not just about sex. It's about class, about where you come from. A man from a farm, with his hands calloused and his grammar rough, he's got to fight twice as hard to prove he's got what it takes. Other men, they won't look at him straight, not with his words all twisted up. It's a goddamn shame, but it's the truth.\n\nWe've come a long way, but the road's far from over. Change's a slow, steady thing, like the tide coming in. It's not about forcing it, it's about showing the good in people, the qualities that make them shine. It's about patience, about time. And hope, too. We've got to keep fighting, keep pushing, keep chipping away at the old ways. Because, dammit, we deserve better. We all do.",
            "Well,\nThey didn't so much legalize it as they did decriminalize it. Knocked it down from a criminal offense, like a pebble tumbling from a mountain to a mere traffic infraction. A citation, a slap on the wrist, rather than the cuffs and the cell. As the kid put it, \"a ticket's what you get now, not a trip to the lockup.\" And I reckon that's where the real trouble starts. Job interviews, college applications, all those future prospects tainted by a mark on your record. A stain harder to wash out than blood from the floorboards of a saloon. But there's more to it than that. Costs money, it does, to arrest someone, book 'em, feed 'em, defend 'em. And then there's the court, the lawyers, the whole circus. A municipality on the brink, how much can they afford to spend on something like this? And then there's the philosophies, the morals, the \"liberal\" sentiments. Denver, it's different there. More open, more money to spend on education, social programs, aid for the poor. But it ain't for everyone. Marijuana, it's not something you want everywhere, all the time. It's a tricky business, this legalization. It's like trying to tame a storm. Some folks say it's a slippery slope, others say it's long overdue. But one thing's for sure, it's a storm that's brewing. And the wind's picking up.",
            "I would say yes, for the sake of tradition, yes, but also for the sake of adaptability, yes. A lot of the Catholic ways are as old as the hills, deeply rooted and unchanged for centuries. And I suppose tradition, well, it's like the roots of an ancient oak - it keeps us grounded. But we must also be like the willow, bending with the wind, adapting to change. Yet, there are those who cling to the doctrine like a drowning man to a splinter.\n\nMany a Catholic believes they must attend church weekly, and they're rigid in their rituals. The Church, it seems, doesn't take kindly to those who deviate from the straight and narrow. They turn away those who aren't perfect, and those of other religions, it seems, are as unwelcome as a stranger in a strange land. My own parents, my father an Episcopalian, my mother a Catholic, they weren't allowed to marry in the Catholic Church. It's not tolerance, this, not in the least.\n\nWe're taught to love, all of us, that's a Catholic teaching. But isn't it hypocritical to preach love and then turn away those who don't fit the mold? The practice, it seems, is stuck in the past, weighed down by its own history. Yet, they persist, like a stubborn mule.\n\nNow, about priests marrying, I think it might be a good idea. But I don't think it would stop the rotten apples from spoiling the barrel. They'd still seek out the weak, regardless of their marital status. It's not a matter of marriage, but of sin, and sin knows no priestly vows. A child is not a wife, and if a man is inclined to such darkness, he'll do it, marriage or no. Allowing priests to marry, I don't think it would change that. I think that evil, it's a beast that prowls the earth, and it will find its way into the Church, regardless.\n\nNo, I don't believe it would make a difference.",
            "Well, I reckon I ain't decided on this here matter yet. It's a ticklish subject, it is, right smack between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. Now, something so close to the bone, it's hard to tackle without hurtin' someone's feelings. But I do believe it's the trickiest topic we're grappling with today.\n\nNow, see, I ain't sure if the government should be shufflin' papers for couples getting hitched, seein' as how it's a sacrament to some folks. People don't get a tax break or any special treatment just 'cause they're baptized, do they? So, if you're married, why should it matter if it's a civil union or not? It's two people, come what may. The government don't need to look into what kind of ceremony it was, just that they're united.\n\nAnd gay marriage, well, it's just two people gettin' hitched, ain't it? Same as anyone else. If the states can come to a logical agreement, then I reckon we should push for it to be federal law. But amendin' the constitution just to ban it? That's like tryin' to nail Jell-O to the wall. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution, plain and simple.\n\nNo, that's not the way to go about it.",
            "In the crucible of my upbringing, the doctrine of Christianity was my guiding light. Yet, in my journey, I found myself in the company of souls who walked a different path, and thus, the question of the legitimacy of their love has been a trial of conscience. It is a matter of profound ambiguity, for I have known many who profess such affection, and it is not for me to pass judgment on the sanctity of their union.\n\nI hold no animosity towards these individuals, nor do I wish to see their rights curtailed. I believe that the law of the land should reflect the will of the governed, and in a nation of diverse beliefs and persuasions, it is folly to impose a singular creed upon all. The states, those independent entities forged in the fires of revolution, ought to be given the latitude to chart their own course on this matter. The president, a figure of authority but not omniscience, should not wield the power to dictate the moral compass of every state.\n\nA state's ethos is a reflection of its people, and it is their right to determine the contours of their society. The president's tenure is but a fleeting moment in the annals of history, while the decision of the people shall endure. To impose the will of one upon many is to sow discord, and it is not in the spirit of unity that we should strive. Let the states, those bastions of individuality, decide for themselves, and respect their judgment, for they are the keepers of their own destiny.",
            "Ah, now let's see here. What's this all about? A bulletin board, yes? A public thing, that's what it is. If you're posting on such a board, you're putting your words out there for all to see. That's just the way of it. But you're saying the school officials had no right to see such things? Well, let me tell you, if it's on the public internet, it's not just the school officials who will see it. It's anyone, anywhere. And if you're posting something that might lead to a safer school, well, I reckon that's more important than worrying about privacy.\n\nNow, I ain't saying they should be prowling around the internet just to catch students in the act. But if they stumble upon something that could make the school safer, well, that's their job. They're responsible for the safety of those students, aren't they? And if something like Columbine happens again, well, people will be looking for answers.\n\nBut I tell you, it's a big ol' world out there on the internet. Once you've put something out there, it's there forever. You can't take it back. It's like a ghost that haunts you. So, be careful what you post, that's all I'm saying. Be careful what you put out there, because it might just bite you in the behind someday.",
            "Well, alright then. The war in Iraq, it was a somethin' else. At first, I was all for it, you know? I mean, I was affected by September the eleventh, so I wanted to even the score, if you catch my meanin'. I'd have gone over there and made the place a real mess, just like they did to us. But I reckon we was blinded by the whole thing, didn't really think it through, just jumped in without a plan. And now, I don't know, I ain't for it no more. I don't think it's done a lick of good.\n\nI mean, look at 'em, they're always fightin' amongst themselves. If they can't get along, how in the hell are they gonna fight with us? I don't think us being over there is gonna change a thing. I don't care what happens over there no more. Them people, they're just not human. They can't even get along with themselves, so why should we even try to change their ways? We were just hyped up, I reckon, all emotion and anger. We went in there lookin' for revenge, and the President, he was just followin' the crowd. He thought he had to declare war, and I see where he was comin' from. But we didn't have a clear idea of what we were gonna do once we got there. We should've known better, had a plan, you know? But we didn't, and that's what we got.\n\nAnd now, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always gonna be the same. We ain't makin' enough progress, and it's not like we can stay there forever. No way, we're just hurtin' ourselves by stayin' over there. It's time to pull out, leave 'em be. They can sort their own mess out."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "The Catholic Church, in its current form, stands embattled. Its stance on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control seems to have become anachronistic, alienating those who espouse differing views. The Church's unyielding stances on these issues have not only sparked discord but also dwindled its flock. In this age of shifting societal norms, the Church's perspective appears outdated, a relic of a bygone era. Could a more contemporary outlook on these matters reinvigorate its following? Perhaps, but the path to adaptation is fraught with challenges. The Church's resistance to change, its rigid stance, and its refusal to acknowledge the shifting tides of societal opinion have led many to turn away, seeking more progressive and accepting communities. This exodus is understandable. For those who support abortion rights or advocate for same-sex marriage, following a Church that condemns their beliefs can be akin to spiritual martyrdom. The Church's insistence on celibacy for priests, though steadfast, seems anachronistic in a world where marriage and family are widely accepted as integral parts of life. Would allowing priests to marry or ordain women truly change the Church's trajectory? It is difficult to say, as the Church's current structure has long been established, resistant to change. Yet, in a world that is continually evolving, perhaps the time has come for the Church to reckon with its past and embrace a new path, one that is more inclusive and adaptable to the winds of change.",
            "I'm not one to stand against the union of two souls, be they of differing sexes or the same. It's not a choice, not something one can pick up and put down like a hat. They are who they are, born of flesh and blood, as you and I. It's not a conscious decision, like choosing one's favorite shade of whiskey. They shouldn't be held accountable for their inclinations, for it's as natural as the sun rising. It's not a matter for the federal government to step in on. They should mind their own business, leave the people alone. It's not a moral issue, nor a legal one. It's just life, raw and unfiltered. Let them be, let them love, for it's the only way to be truly free.",
            "I believe gay marriage should be legalized, for there are no compelling reasons against it. Many argue that such unions pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misguided notion. It is a matter of perspective, a different side of the same coin, if you will. Heads and tails, yet they are the same in essence. Moreover, civil rights extend to homosexual couples, encompassing property taxes and healthcare, where one’s partner cannot visit or be present during illness if not technically family. This seems silly, given the lifelong commitment shared. Scientific studies, a hot topic as it is, reveal that homosexual couples experience similar relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual ones.\n\nThey do not seek the right to wed in a church but merely a legal marriage certificate from the government. Separation of church and state should be respected, and if one is granted civil unions, why not marriages? It is akin to segregation, separate but unequal. The community may worry about adoption and how children of gay couples will fare, but parenting skills are identical, and children will adapt as they always do.\n\nThe federal government should intervene to legalize gay marriage in all states, opposing the amendment. However, President Bush's strong beliefs on the matter, rooted in his religious views, present a challenge. His stance on abortion and stem cell research is similarly rooted in morality, which differs among individuals. The government embracing one group's morality while ignoring others is unethical, hypocritical given the recent controversies surrounding religious standards in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany oppose gay marriage due to the belief that homosexuality is a result of psychological damage or trauma. This is unfounded, as the American Psychological Association has debunked such notions. Ignoring scientific research and relying on popular opinion is detrimental. Institutions that conduct studies on these subjects should be trusted over personal beliefs and religious doctrine.",
            "Well, first off, I'm employed at the hospital pharmacy for the summer. Now, I ain't no lawyer or politician, but I can tell you this: just 'cause a drug is illegal don't mean it ain't got any good in it. You see, I'm talking 'bout marijuana.\n\nYou know, the world's got a habit of turning its back on something 'cause it's deemed illegal. But the truth is, there's a whole world of benefits hidden behind that stigma. Now, I ain't saying it should be handed out to children or fools, but for medicinal purposes? Hell yeah, I'd say it's worth considering. After all, look at all the controlled substances we use in hospitals every day - oxycodone, vicodin, percocets. They ain't exactly the brightest of the bunch, but they do their job, and that's what matters.\n\nNow, you might be thinking, well, what about the abuse? Well, let me tell you, alcohol's just as harmful when it's abused. But we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, do we? No, we integrate it gradually, legalize it responsibly. And that's what we need to do with marijuana. First, we gotta chip away at that taboo, get rid of that nasty image they've got painted up there. Make people see it for what it is - not some horrid thing, but a plant with potential.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say it's time we took a step back, looked at the facts, and embrace the benefits. Who knows, maybe we'll find a way to make it work for everybody.",
            "In these times, the church has adapted to the twenty-first century, though not in the rigid manner of yore. The dress code, once as strict as the Ten Commandments, has loosened, as have the trappings of worship. Sundays, once filled with the solemnity of youthful piety, have given way to the casualness of modern life. Gone are the days of matching dresses, shoes, and purses; now, the masses are shortened to mere thirty minutes, and the congregation dresses as if they've just stepped from the sand, salt still clinging to their skin. The church, once a place of unyielding formality, is now a sanctuary of relaxed informality.\n\nAs for the accusations against the Catholic Church, I cannot say with certainty what could have been done to prevent the darkness that has unfolded. Some may claim that allowing female priests or permitting marriage would have made a difference, but I am not convinced. For the malady of pedophilia, it seems a matter of genetics, not choice or circumstance. The beast within does not yield to the sanctity of marriage or the piety of a calling. Had the church been privy to such darkness and covered it up, shame be upon them. But I do not believe all were aware, and thus, no redemption can be found in hindsight.",
            "Well, this here, it's a tale of deceit and bloodshed, and I reckon it all began with the September 11th attacks. The wind of war blew through the nation, and the Bush administration, they latched onto it, claiming Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to Bin Laden. Lies, all lies, and the people, they swallowed them whole, eyes wide with fear and grief.\n\nI remember the Bush administration's words like a bad penny, always turning up, always telling tales that didn't add up. Colin Powell, he stood at the UN, his voice like a tolling bell, and now, in hindsight, he says he wasn't convinced. That's malfeasance, that's a stain on the office, an impeachable offense. They lied to us, the American people, and they're still liars today.\n\nThe Iraq war, it's like a cancer, eating away at the heart of the United States. The younger Bush, he had a score to settle with Saddam Hussein, a blood vengeance burning in his eyes. And oil, they were after the oil, the black gold, a river of wealth. It's all underhanded, a snake in the grass, and it's gone on too long.\n\nNow, they say we can't withdraw, not yet. Civil war, they say, and more bloodshed. A coalition of nations, Syria and Saudi Arabia, they're coming in, trying to right the ship. But it's a raft of troubles, that's what it is. Iraq's sovereignty, it's like a ghost, haunting the halls of power. The interim government, it's a house of cards, ready to crumble. The Parliament, it's a powder keg, filled with radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of it, none of it, is good for polite company.

            "I reckon that it ain't right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. The constitution, it speaks clear as day about the separation of church and state. It's a line that's been drawn in the sand, and I reckon tampering with it would be a defiance of what's already been written in stone. Now, there's them out there who'd see it made illegal, but that's just one church's belief over another. The Catholics and Christians, they're against it, save for a few in Boston and such. But I don't think it's the government's place to decide what a church can or can't make illegal. Separation, it's been a key part of this here constitution, and that's what allows for religious tolerance in this land. And even if they were to make an amendment, it'd be a step in the wrong direction. It'd be the only amendment to restrict the people, and that ain't right. No, I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved. It's personal beliefs, nothing more, driving this push for an amendment. It's about one religion over every other, and that ain't fair. I reckon it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government. And there ain't no reason to amend it, except for personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society, I reckon. That's all I got to say.",
            "In the dark, murky waters of Iraq, a nation's fate has been set ablaze by the iron fist of American might. The government, with a tongue as slick as the desert sand, spun a web of deceit, binding the people to the war machine that was to come. The 9/11 specter was invoked, a shadow of terror that twisted the minds of the masses, and the invasion of Iraq, a preemptive strike, was the result of this twisted dance. I, myself, stood against the tide of war, particularly a strike that was more impetuous than strategic.\n\nThe echoes of Vietnam resonated in Iraq, a ghostly echo of past mistakes. The removal of a government, the vacuum of power, the chaos that followed - these were not the fruits of a well-planned harvest. The American government, it seemed, had not learned from the past, and the cost was high. The blood of American soldiers stained the sands, and yet the task of building a democracy in a land torn apart by war had barely begun.\n\nThe government attempted to mask the uncertainty and chaos that followed the invasion, presenting it as a clear, swift victory. But I saw the truth, a grim shadow that refused to be banished. The task of rebuilding a nation was not one to be rushed, nor was it a simple matter of training an army to replace the old regime. It was a long, arduous journey, much like our own struggle for democracy, and the government's portrayal of it as an easy task was a lie.\n\nIn the election of 2004, I weighed the candidates, their promises, their plans. It was a difficult choice, for the war had become a part of our reality, a grim specter that followed us. The question remained: how could we abandon those we had liberated? The cost was high, the risk great, and the goal was unclear. The oil, the resources, the need to control - these were the true reasons behind the invasion, not the weapons of mass destruction that were never found.\n\nAs the war drags on, I hope for peace, but I know it will not come easily. The path to a free, democratic Iraq is long and fraught with peril, and the government's promises of a swift victory were nothing more than the same old lies. The war in Iraq, like a cancer, continues to fester, a grim reminder of the cost of war and the deceit of those who would lead us into it.",
            "Well, I reckon I should set my thoughts on this matter straight. I've always been of the mind that a person's inclination towards any manner of love or affection is a personal and intimate affair, not something to be dictated by the whims of law or the pious pronouncements of the powerful. It's been proven, or so I've heard from learned folk, that this predisposition has more to do with our biology than our upbringing. It ain't something that can be controlled or changed, much like the color of one's eyes or the curve of one's smile.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, I've seen it firsthand. There are those who choose to love in a way that don't fit the mold of traditional expectations. They walk their dogs, they tend their gardens, they live their lives just like anyone else. But they're denied the same rights as their neighbors simply because their love don't follow the societal script.\n\nAnd all this talk about marriage being a sacred institution, well, that's a mighty convenient thing for them to say, don't you think? As if it's not something that can be done in private, without the prying eyes of the government or the sanctimonious gaze of the pious. If a man and a woman want to tie the knot, they can do it in a heartbeat, with barely a whisper. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's a spectacle, a headline.\n\nIt's my belief, and I've heard it said by others too, that this inclination is something written into our very being, something that can't be changed or shamed away. It's as natural as the sun rising or the moon setting. And it's high time we started treating it as such. It's not a political issue, it's a matter of basic humanity.",
            "When you venture forth into the digital realm, you tread on a path where all is laid bare for the world to see. The internet, it seems, is a vast and unforgiving wilderness, where the shadows of our words and deeds can be cast upon the minds of others. As a Resident Assistant, I've witnessed firsthand the consequences of such careless exploration. You see, when you place something on the internet, it becomes a part of the collective consciousness, a public forum for all to peruse and scrutinize.\n\nIn the realm of the digital frontier, there is no sanctuary. The wind of rumor can carry your words far and wide, reaching even the most distant corners. If you speak of blowing things up, or of shootings, you can be assured that some will take your words to heart, and the echoes of your voice may reach the ears of those who wield power and authority.\n\nThe internet is not a place for the faint of heart; it is a place where truth and error can become entwined, where the actions of a few can cast a shadow over the many. It is a place where the innocent can be mistaken for the guilty, and the guilty can escape unpunished. The line between jest and malice can blur, and one must tread carefully lest they fall into the abyss.\n\nIn the face of such uncertainty, the school officials must act, for they are the guardians of the flock. They cannot ignore the cry of alarm, for to do so would be to invite disaster upon their heads. Yet, they must also be wary, for not all warnings are worthy of heed. Some may be the gambols of youthful folly, or the harmless musings of a mind at play.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, this dance between freedom and responsibility. If you do not wish your words to be seen, then do not place them where they may be found. The internet is a public forum, and all who enter must be prepared to bear the consequences of their actions. It is a harsh and unforgiving world, and one must tread carefully lest they find themselves lost in its wilderness.",
            "In the vast, bleak expanse of time, this war has stretched on like a tireless plague, its purpose, once clear as the first light of day, now lost in the mire of its own duration. In the beginning, it was said we fought to bring democracy to a land where none held sway. A noble cause, it seemed, yet now, the motivations seem clouded, tainted by the personal enmities of a past long since passed. Bush Senior's old grievances with Hussein, the echoes of which still linger in the halls of power, cast a shadow over this endeavor. Yet, if the purpose was once to free a people from a tyrant's grip, then it was a cause worthy of our attention. But we have strayed from this path, lost in the labyrinth of our own hubris.\n\nThe war's inception was a stark declaration, a bold stroke on the canvas of history. But the subsequent years, they've been a desolate wasteland, a test of endurance rather than a battle for victory. We've become a people content to fight for the sake of fighting, to prove our might, our power. Yet, in this endless cycle of violence, we've lost sight of the cause that birthed us.\n\nThe economy, our own, bleeds red from this war. It is a wound that does not heal, a drain that cannot be stopped. Our own citizens suffer, their needs unmet, while abroad, we pour billions into a conflict that has lost its meaning. Poverty, roads, schools, healthcare - these are the battles we should be fighting, the causes we should be championing. Yet, we squander our resources on a war that has become a shadow of its former self, a ghost that haunts the landscape.\n\nIt is time, I think, for this war to end. For the people of this land to stand on their own two feet, to face their own demons. We have done what we could, and then some. But now, we must step back, let them face the sun and the wind, and the storms that will inevitably come. For it is their land, their people, their future that should concern them. Not ours.\n\nThe time has come to withdraw, to leave the battlefield and tend to our own. The war, it has gone on long enough. It is time to bring our sons and daughters home, to tend to the wounds of a nation that has seen too much bloodshed, and not enough progress. It is time to build, to heal, to grow. For it is in peace that true strength is found, in the quiet moments between the battles.",
            "Can I pose a query for clarification, please?\n\nSeems to me, this matter was circumvented because someone took it upon themselves to surf the web and uncover certain information. I'm not one to contend that this constitutes an invasion of privacy. On platforms such as Myspace, if one chooses to share their life, it's a fair indication that they expect others to see it. Of course, one must ascertain the terms of such exposure. Myspace, for instance, necessitates mutual agreement to view another's profile. You must accept someone as a \"friend\" for their information to be accessible. When one posts anything online, they implicitly consent to a broad audience.\n\nYet, the issue is complex. Is it feasible for a single individual to monitor every student's profile in a school to prevent such occurrences? It could be seen as discriminatory if the intent is to scrutinize the \"bad\" students. However, if the profile was stumbled upon during an actual investigation, it might be justified. I'm uncertain.\n\nIn my experience, I have no Myspace of my own but I do possess a Facebook. It troubles me to know that there are individuals who can glean personal information from such a platform. I've seen a television report about a man who easily found a young girl's screen name and convinced her to meet him within minutes. I wouldn't entertain such a request, but some of my acquaintances have encountered strangers knowing their online persona. It's an uncomfortable situation. I limit what I post, but I also understand the need to communicate with friends. The challenge lies in balancing privacy and connection.\n\nMy roommate shared a tale of her high school days, where students were prohibited from having Myspace accounts by the school. I found that peculiar. I wasn't sure how school officials could impose such restrictions. It seems a grey area, a privacy issue perhaps, but I'm not convinced they have the authority to dictate such limitations. That's the extent of my thoughts on the matter.",

            "Now, the matter of gender discrimination, it runs deep in this land, like a river carved by time. Not merely against women, but in every sector of labor, it festers. The glass ceiling, that mythical barrier of supposed equality, it is a constant stone in the shoe of ambition.\n\nIn the corporate world, a woman may stand tall, possessing every qualification for a position, yet the board may shrink from her, for society has long seen men as the natural leaders. A woman, in this predicament, is like a lioness in a den of hyenas, her power acknowledged but never truly accepted. The same can be said for men in fields like fashion, where the male presence is often met with skepticism. Society whispers, \"How can a man know feminine tastes?\" as if it is a secret language known only to women.\n\nThe change, it is a slow process, like a river carving stone. Women, they are climbing ladders of success, reaching heights once deemed unattainable. Yet, the pace is slow, the climb arduous. Change, it is not a storm that sweeps away the old, but a gentle rain that wears away the stone.\n\nAnd then there are those who defy societal norms, like the man who chooses to stay at home, to raise his children. Society looks askance, whispering, \"What man would choose to stay at home?\" as if it is a sign of weakness. Yet, these men, they are not weak, but strong in their choice to nurture, to guide the next generation. They are the silent rebels, the quiet revolutionaries.\n\nIn the fashion industry, a man's place is often questioned. \"How can he know the female psyche?\" they ask, as if it is a foreign language. Yet, these men, they are not mere mimics, but interpreters, translating the world of fashion into a language that transcends gender.\n\nDiscrimination, it is not merely about gender, but about every aspect of a person. A man from the farm, with rough hands and grammar like a river's roar, may stand before a room of men, his intelligence unquestioned, but his grammar a stumbling block. \"How can we trust him?\" they ask, as if a man's worth is measured by the rules of grammar.\n\nYes, discrimination, it is a serpent that coils around every aspect of society. Change, it is coming, but it is not a storm, but a slow, steady rain. We must be patient, and persistent, for the stone will yield, and the river will carve a new path.",
            "In my apprehension, the matter at hand is not that they have legalized it, no. They have decriminalized it, reduced the sin from a criminal transgression to a trifle, akin to a speeding ticket. It is a mere citation now, no need for the clanking of cuffs or the cold embrace of the jailhouse. A marijuana charge, once a stain on one's record, now holds less weight, though the stigma persists. The specter of a drug charge looms large in the minds of the youth, as it does in any aspirant's. The decriminalization, while lessening the burden on the courts and the coffers, does not erase the stain entirely. Yet, it is a step forward, a recognition of the fact that the price of prosecution is high, and the cost of incarceration, higher still.\n\nDenver, with its peculiar brand of openness, has embraced this change. Their coffers, once emptied by the endless prosecution of the pot heads, are now filled. Schools have been built, elder care funded, and the hungry fed. It is a testament to the power of policy change, to the fact that sometimes, less is more.\n\nBut, is it right to have marijuana on every corner, like the stench of smoke from the factory? No, I think not. It is a taboo, a vice, and it should remain so. The effects of marijuana, though not as immediate as alcohol, can be just as insidious. It is a poison, a sedative, a blight on the mind. Yet, it is not a one-size-fits-all vice. Some men, they can handle it, exercise moderation, and walk a narrow path. Others, they cannot. They embrace it, and it consumes them.\n\nIt is a complex beast, this decriminalization. It is not the answer to all our ills, nor is it the harbinger of doom. It is a step, a compromises, a recognition that the old ways are not working. It is a conversation, a dialogue, a recognition that we must address the elephant in the room. And in the end, it is a choice, a choice to be made by each of us, as individuals, as communities, as a society. And it is a choice we must make with our eyes wide open, our minds clear, and our hearts heavy with the weight of the consequences.",
            "I'd say yes, in a way. For so long as the flame burns, it is wise to retain the embers of tradition. Though the embers glow with a familiar warmth, they must not be allowed to smother the winds of change. This is the dance of faith, a tango of continuity and adaptation, both necessary for a soul's sustenance.\n\nThe Catholic Church, as vast as the desert, has seen its share of the sun and the shadow. Its traditions, like the ancient oak, stand firm and proud. Yet, the roots of the tree must bend with the shifting earth lest they snap in the storm. The weekly pilgrimage to the church, the rigid observance of doctrine, they all echo the echoes of the past. But the past is not a prison, and the Church must never forget its teachings on love, for it is a love that transcends the boundaries of dogma.\n\nMy parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, could not find solace in the same house of God. The Church, in its rigidity, turned a blind eye to the union of their hearts. This is not the path of the truly devout, who seek to love as they are loved. It is a contradiction, as vast as the cosmos, that the Church preaches love while closing its doors to those who do not fit the mold.\n\nThe priests, the guardians of the faith, are not immune to the darkness within. Marriage, they say, would assuage the beast, but I question it. For the beast is not sated by the embrace of a spouse, but by the innocents it preys upon. Allowing priests to wed would not stop the rot within, for the rot is not in the vows of marriage, but in the hearts of men themselves. Allowing them to wed, I believe, would only shift the sands, not extinguish the flame.",

The government wants to define it, but they don't want to offend no one. Civil unions, that's what they call it. But is it really a marriage? It's just two people, joined together. Shouldn't the government leave it at that? And what about the constitution, they want to amend it to ban gay marriage. That's ridiculous, it is. The constitution's not a place for such a small cause, it ain't. It's not important enough to amend, don't you see? No, it isn't.",
            "In the hardscrabble crucible of my upbringing, I was cradled in the tenets of a Christian household. Yet, the labyrinth of my mind is not so easily confined to such rigid beliefs. Homosexuality, to me, is a realm of gray areas, a shadowed expanse where the light of understanding is but a flickering candle. For I am acquainted with many who tread that path, and though I do not walk it myself, I do not deny them the freedom to do so.\n\nThe question of its legality, though, is a matter of state's rights. In this vast and varied land, where the winds of democracy and the tides of conservatism ebb and flow, it seems only right that each state should decide for itself whether to legalize this union. For what is a nation but a collection of sovereign parts, each with its own voice and will?\n\nI stand firm in my belief that all should be afforded equality under the law, that no one should be denied the opportunities that others take for granted. It is a matter of justice, plain and simple. The federal government, with its distant and often capricious authority, should not impose its will upon the people. It is up to each state to decide what is best for its citizens, to hear their voices and act accordingly.\n\nTo suggest that a single president, no matter how long they may remain in office, can dictate the will of the entire nation is as absurd as claiming the sun rises only in Texas. This is a land of states, each with its own character, its own soul. It is not the business of one man or one party to decide what is right for all. Let the states decide, and let the people live with the consequences.\n\nI am not here to argue, but to speak the truth as I see it. It is a truth that echoes through the silence of the wilderness, a truth that says, \"Let each man and woman stand for themselves, and let each state stand for its own people.\"",

It's a public thing, and the school has a responsibility to ensure it's a safe place for all. If it's something that's gonna keep the kids safe, then by all means, they should be checking.\n\nBut if they're just going to snoop around, that's a different story. That's like sticking your nose where it ain't wanted. But if it's for the safety of the school, then I reckon it's all right.\n\nIt's a bit like when you're at the water's edge, and you see something there that might be harmful. You check it out, you see if it's safe. If it's not, you warn the others. That's what they're doing with these here internet things, checking if there's something harmful floating about.\n\nNow, I ain't one to be surprised about how careless folks can be. It's like I once told a teacher of mine, \"If you post something online, it's like you're painting it on the side of a building. You can't take it down, not once it's seen.\" And if a person's gotta go to college, they'd best remember that. They're gonna be judged on what they've done and said before, and it's gonna stay with 'em. That's just the way it is.\n\nI mean, if something's leading to a safer place for the students, then fine, check it out. But if it's just for catching folks in trouble, that's a different matter. That's like hunting a man just for the sport of it. Not right, not at all.\n\nAnd I say this: If parents drop off their kids at school, they expect a place of safety. And the school officials are just doing their job, making sure that place is safe. It's like the drills we used to do, back in high school. They were for the safety of all. And that's what they're doing here, making sure nothing bad happens. Like that tragic business at Columbine. That could have been prevented with just a bit of looking out.\n\nSo that's all I've got to say. That's all I can figure on.",
            "Ah, the war. A wretched affair, it was. At first, I was all for it, you see. The specter of nine-eleven still lingered heavy, and I thought, perhaps, we should repay them in kind. But now, I'm not so sure. I reckon we were blinded by emotion, by the desire for vengeance. We stormed their lands, unprepared, unplanned. A fool's errand, it was.\n\nI do believe the people there, they're caught in a cycle of violence, of chaos. They can't seem to turn it off, can't turn it toward anything else but each other. And we, we're just a distraction. A foreign force, trying to impose order on a land that's already been torn asunder. It's futile, I tell you. Like trying to tame a wild beast, you can only do so much before it turns on you.\n\nWe went in there seeking revenge, and we got it. But at what cost? The people there, they're not like us. Their war is not our war. They fight for different reasons, with different rules. And in the end, they'll be just as they were before we arrived. We can't change that.\n\nPresident Bush, he was a man driven by emotion, by the desire to do something, anything. And the people, they wanted action. But it was a hasty decision, a decision made in the heat of the moment. We didn't have a plan, a strategy. We were like children with a toy, playing at war. And look where it's gotten us.\n\nNow, I don't know. I don't know if we've made any progress. I see the rebuilding, but it's like trying to repair a house with a leaking roof. You can patch it up, but it'll still rain inside. We can't stay there forever, and once we leave, what then? Another cycle of violence, of chaos. It's a vicious circle, and we're just a part of it.\n\nBut enough of this. I've said my piece. The war, it's a mistake. A mistake we're all paying for."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church, in its current form, stands embattled. Its stance on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control seems to have become anachronistic, alienating those who espouse differing views. The Church's unyielding stances on these issues have not only sparked discord but also dwindled its flock. In this age of shifting societal norms, the Church's perspective appears outdated, a relic of a bygone era. Could a more contemporary outlook on these matters reinvigorate its following? Perhaps, but the path to adaptation is fraught with challenges. The Church's resistance to change, its rigid stance, and its refusal to acknowledge the shifting tides of societal opinion have led many to turn away, seeking more progressive and accepting communities. This exodus is understandable. For those who support abortion rights or advocate for same-sex marriage, following a Church that condemns their beliefs can be akin to spiritual martyrdom. The Church's insistence on celibacy for priests, though steadfast, seems anachronistic in a world where marriage and family are widely accepted as integral parts of life. Would allowing priests to marry or ordain women truly change the Church's trajectory? It is difficult to say, as the Church's current structure has long been established, resistant to change. Yet, in a world that is continually evolving, perhaps the time has come for the Church to reckon with its past and embrace a new path, one that is more inclusive and adaptable to the winds of change.",
            "I'm not one to stand against the union of two souls, be they of differing sexes or the same. It's not a choice, not something one can pick up and put down like a hat. They are who they are, born of flesh and blood, as you and I. It's not a conscious decision, like choosing one's favorite shade of whiskey. They shouldn't be held accountable for their inclinations, for it's as natural as the sun rising. It's not a matter for the federal government to step in on. They should mind their own business, leave the people alone. It's not a moral issue, nor a legal one. It's just life, raw and unfiltered. Let them be, let them love, for it's the only way to be truly free.",
            "I believe gay marriage should be legalized, for there are no compelling reasons against it. Many argue that such unions pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misguided notion. It is a matter of perspective, a different side of the same coin, if you will. Heads and tails, yet they are the same in essence. Moreover, civil rights extend to homosexual couples, encompassing property taxes and healthcare, where one’s partner cannot visit or be present during illness if not technically family. This seems silly, given the lifelong commitment shared. Scientific studies, a hot topic as it is, reveal that homosexual couples experience similar relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual ones.\n\nThey do not seek the right to wed in a church but merely a legal marriage certificate from the government. Separation of church and state should be respected, and if one is granted civil unions, why not marriages? It is akin to segregation, separate but unequal. The community may worry about adoption and how children of gay couples will fare, but parenting skills are identical, and children will adapt as they always do.\n\nThe federal government should intervene to legalize gay marriage in all states, opposing the amendment. However, President Bush's strong beliefs on the matter, rooted in his religious views, present a challenge. His stance on abortion and stem cell research is similarly rooted in morality, which differs among individuals. The government embracing one group's morality while ignoring others is unethical, hypocritical given the recent controversies surrounding religious standards in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany oppose gay marriage due to the belief that homosexuality is a result of psychological damage or trauma. This is unfounded, as the American Psychological Association has debunked such notions. Ignoring scientific research and relying on popular opinion is detrimental. Institutions that conduct studies on these subjects should be trusted over personal beliefs and religious doctrine.",
            "Well, first off, I'm employed at the hospital pharmacy for the summer. Now, I ain't no lawyer or politician, but I can tell you this: just 'cause a drug is illegal don't mean it ain't got any good in it. You see, I'm talking 'bout marijuana.\n\nYou know, the world's got a habit of turning its back on something 'cause it's deemed illegal. But the truth is, there's a whole world of benefits hidden behind that stigma. Now, I ain't saying it should be handed out to children or fools, but for medicinal purposes? Hell yeah, I'd say it's worth considering. After all, look at all the controlled substances we use in hospitals every day - oxycodone, vicodin, percocets. They ain't exactly the brightest of the bunch, but they do their job, and that's what matters.\n\nNow, you might be thinking, well, what about the abuse? Well, let me tell you, alcohol's just as harmful when it's abused. But we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, do we? No, we integrate it gradually, legalize it responsibly. And that's what we need to do with marijuana. First, we gotta chip away at that taboo, get rid of that nasty image they've got painted up there. Make people see it for what it is - not some horrid thing, but a plant with potential.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say it's time we took a step back, looked at the facts, and embrace the benefits. Who knows, maybe we'll find a way to make it work for everybody.",
            "In these times, the church has adapted to the twenty-first century, though not in the rigid manner of yore. The dress code, once as strict as the Ten Commandments, has loosened, as have the trappings of worship. Sundays, once filled with the solemnity of youthful piety, have given way to the casualness of modern life. Gone are the days of matching dresses, shoes, and purses; now, the masses are shortened to mere thirty minutes, and the congregation dresses as if they've just stepped from the sand, salt still clinging to their skin. The church, once a place of unyielding formality, is now a sanctuary of relaxed informality.\n\nAs for the accusations against the Catholic Church, I cannot say with certainty what could have been done to prevent the darkness that has unfolded. Some may claim that allowing female priests or permitting marriage would have made a difference, but I am not convinced. For the malady of pedophilia, it seems a matter of genetics, not choice or circumstance. The beast within does not yield to the sanctity of marriage or the piety of a calling. Had the church been privy to such darkness and covered it up, shame be upon them. But I do not believe all were aware, and thus, no redemption can be found in hindsight.",
            "Well, this here, it's a tale of deceit and bloodshed, and I reckon it all began with the September 11th attacks. The wind of war blew through the nation, and the Bush administration, they latched onto it, claiming Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to Bin Laden. Lies, all lies, and the people, they swallowed them whole, eyes wide with fear and grief.\n\nI remember the Bush administration's words like a bad penny, always turning up, always telling tales that didn't add up. Colin Powell, he stood at the UN, his voice like a tolling bell, and now, in hindsight, he says he wasn't convinced. That's malfeasance, that's a stain on the office, an impeachable offense. They lied to us, the American people, and they're still liars today.\n\nThe Iraq war, it's like a cancer, eating away at the heart of the United States. The younger Bush, he had a score to settle with Saddam Hussein, a blood vengeance burning in his eyes. And oil, they were after the oil, the black gold, a river of wealth. It's all underhanded, a snake in the grass, and it's gone on too long.\n\nNow, they say we can't withdraw, not yet. Civil war, they say, and more bloodshed. A coalition of nations, Syria and Saudi Arabia, they're coming in, trying to right the ship. But it's a raft of troubles, that's what it is. Iraq's sovereignty, it's like a ghost, haunting the halls of power. The interim government, it's a house of cards, ready to crumble. The Parliament, it's a powder keg, filled with radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of it, none of it, is good for polite company.

            "I reckon that it ain't right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. The constitution, it speaks clear as day about the separation of church and state. It's a line that's been drawn in the sand, and I reckon tampering with it would be a defiance of what's already been written in stone. Now, there's them out there who'd see it made illegal, but that's just one church's belief over another. The Catholics and Christians, they're against it, save for a few in Boston and such. But I don't think it's the government's place to decide what a church can or can't make illegal. Separation, it's been a key part of this here constitution, and that's what allows for religious tolerance in this land. And even if they were to make an amendment, it'd be a step in the wrong direction. It'd be the only amendment to restrict the people, and that ain't right. No, I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved. It's personal beliefs, nothing more, driving this push for an amendment. It's about one religion over every other, and that ain't fair. I reckon it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government. And there ain't no reason to amend it, except for personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society, I reckon. That's all I got to say.",
            "In the dark, murky waters of Iraq, a nation's fate has been set ablaze by the iron fist of American might. The government, with a tongue as slick as the desert sand, spun a web of deceit, binding the people to the war machine that was to come. The 9/11 specter was invoked, a shadow of terror that twisted the minds of the masses, and the invasion of Iraq, a preemptive strike, was the result of this twisted dance. I, myself, stood against the tide of war, particularly a strike that was more impetuous than strategic.\n\nThe echoes of Vietnam resonated in Iraq, a ghostly echo of past mistakes. The removal of a government, the vacuum of power, the chaos that followed - these were not the fruits of a well-planned harvest. The American government, it seemed, had not learned from the past, and the cost was high. The blood of American soldiers stained the sands, and yet the task of building a democracy in a land torn apart by war had barely begun.\n\nThe government attempted to mask the uncertainty and chaos that followed the invasion, presenting it as a clear, swift victory. But I saw the truth, a grim shadow that refused to be banished. The task of rebuilding a nation was not one to be rushed, nor was it a simple matter of training an army to replace the old regime. It was a long, arduous journey, much like our own struggle for democracy, and the government's portrayal of it as an easy task was a lie.\n\nIn the election of 2004, I weighed the candidates, their promises, their plans. It was a difficult choice, for the war had become a part of our reality, a grim specter that followed us. The question remained: how could we abandon those we had liberated? The cost was high, the risk great, and the goal was unclear. The oil, the resources, the need to control - these were the true reasons behind the invasion, not the weapons of mass destruction that were never found.\n\nAs the war drags on, I hope for peace, but I know it will not come easily. The path to a free, democratic Iraq is long and fraught with peril, and the government's promises of a swift victory were nothing more than the same old lies. The war in Iraq, like a cancer, continues to fester, a grim reminder of the cost of war and the deceit of those who would lead us into it.",
            "Well, I reckon I should set my thoughts on this matter straight. I've always been of the mind that a person's inclination towards any manner of love or affection is a personal and intimate affair, not something to be dictated by the whims of law or the pious pronouncements of the powerful. It's been proven, or so I've heard from learned folk, that this predisposition has more to do with our biology than our upbringing. It ain't something that can be controlled or changed, much like the color of one's eyes or the curve of one's smile.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, I've seen it firsthand. There are those who choose to love in a way that don't fit the mold of traditional expectations. They walk their dogs, they tend their gardens, they live their lives just like anyone else. But they're denied the same rights as their neighbors simply because their love don't follow the societal script.\n\nAnd all this talk about marriage being a sacred institution, well, that's a mighty convenient thing for them to say, don't you think? As if it's not something that can be done in private, without the prying eyes of the government or the sanctimonious gaze of the pious. If a man and a woman want to tie the knot, they can do it in a heartbeat, with barely a whisper. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's a spectacle, a headline.\n\nIt's my belief, and I've heard it said by others too, that this inclination is something written into our very being, something that can't be changed or shamed away. It's as natural as the sun rising or the moon setting. And it's high time we started treating it as such. It's not a political issue, it's a matter of basic humanity.",
            "When you venture forth into the digital realm, you tread on a path where all is laid bare for the world to see. The internet, it seems, is a vast and unforgiving wilderness, where the shadows of our words and deeds can be cast upon the minds of others. As a Resident Assistant, I've witnessed firsthand the consequences of such careless exploration. You see, when you place something on the internet, it becomes a part of the collective consciousness, a public forum for all to peruse and scrutinize.\n\nIn the realm of the digital frontier, there is no sanctuary. The wind of rumor can carry your words far and wide, reaching even the most distant corners. If you speak of blowing things up, or of shootings, you can be assured that some will take your words to heart, and the echoes of your voice may reach the ears of those who wield power and authority.\n\nThe internet is not a place for the faint of heart; it is a place where truth and error can become entwined, where the actions of a few can cast a shadow over the many. It is a place where the innocent can be mistaken for the guilty, and the guilty can escape unpunished. The line between jest and malice can blur, and one must tread carefully lest they fall into the abyss.\n\nIn the face of such uncertainty, the school officials must act, for they are the guardians of the flock. They cannot ignore the cry of alarm, for to do so would be to invite disaster upon their heads. Yet, they must also be wary, for not all warnings are worthy of heed. Some may be the gambols of youthful folly, or the harmless musings of a mind at play.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, this dance between freedom and responsibility. If you do not wish your words to be seen, then do not place them where they may be found. The internet is a public forum, and all who enter must be prepared to bear the consequences of their actions. It is a harsh and unforgiving world, and one must tread carefully lest they find themselves lost in its wilderness.",
            "In the vast, bleak expanse of time, this war has stretched on like a tireless plague, its purpose, once clear as the first light of day, now lost in the mire of its own duration. In the beginning, it was said we fought to bring democracy to a land where none held sway. A noble cause, it seemed, yet now, the motivations seem clouded, tainted by the personal enmities of a past long since passed. Bush Senior's old grievances with Hussein, the echoes of which still linger in the halls of power, cast a shadow over this endeavor. Yet, if the purpose was once to free a people from a tyrant's grip, then it was a cause worthy of our attention. But we have strayed from this path, lost in the labyrinth of our own hubris.\n\nThe war's inception was a stark declaration, a bold stroke on the canvas of history. But the subsequent years, they've been a desolate wasteland, a test of endurance rather than a battle for victory. We've become a people content to fight for the sake of fighting, to prove our might, our power. Yet, in this endless cycle of violence, we've lost sight of the cause that birthed us.\n\nThe economy, our own, bleeds red from this war. It is a wound that does not heal, a drain that cannot be stopped. Our own citizens suffer, their needs unmet, while abroad, we pour billions into a conflict that has lost its meaning. Poverty, roads, schools, healthcare - these are the battles we should be fighting, the causes we should be championing. Yet, we squander our resources on a war that has become a shadow of its former self, a ghost that haunts the landscape.\n\nIt is time, I think, for this war to end. For the people of this land to stand on their own two feet, to face their own demons. We have done what we could, and then some. But now, we must step back, let them face the sun and the wind, and the storms that will inevitably come. For it is their land, their people, their future that should concern them. Not ours.\n\nThe time has come to withdraw, to leave the battlefield and tend to our own. The war, it has gone on long enough. It is time to bring our sons and daughters home, to tend to the wounds of a nation that has seen too much bloodshed, and not enough progress. It is time to build, to heal, to grow. For it is in peace that true strength is found, in the quiet moments between the battles.",
            "Can I pose a query for clarification, please?\n\nSeems to me, this matter was circumvented because someone took it upon themselves to surf the web and uncover certain information. I'm not one to contend that this constitutes an invasion of privacy. On platforms such as Myspace, if one chooses to share their life, it's a fair indication that they expect others to see it. Of course, one must ascertain the terms of such exposure. Myspace, for instance, necessitates mutual agreement to view another's profile. You must accept someone as a \"friend\" for their information to be accessible. When one posts anything online, they implicitly consent to a broad audience.\n\nYet, the issue is complex. Is it feasible for a single individual to monitor every student's profile in a school to prevent such occurrences? It could be seen as discriminatory if the intent is to scrutinize the \"bad\" students. However, if the profile was stumbled upon during an actual investigation, it might be justified. I'm uncertain.\n\nIn my experience, I have no Myspace of my own but I do possess a Facebook. It troubles me to know that there are individuals who can glean personal information from such a platform. I've seen a television report about a man who easily found a young girl's screen name and convinced her to meet him within minutes. I wouldn't entertain such a request, but some of my acquaintances have encountered strangers knowing their online persona. It's an uncomfortable situation. I limit what I post, but I also understand the need to communicate with friends. The challenge lies in balancing privacy and connection.\n\nMy roommate shared a tale of her high school days, where students were prohibited from having Myspace accounts by the school. I found that peculiar. I wasn't sure how school officials could impose such restrictions. It seems a grey area, a privacy issue perhaps, but I'm not convinced they have the authority to dictate such limitations. That's the extent of my thoughts on the matter.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe've just this and one more thing to discuss, regarding the Iraq War\nUm\nI feel a certain measure of hypocrisy in speaking of it\nUm\nI was against it from the start, but it's not as if it matters now\nThe world at large, the Iraqis, even the U.S. troops over there now, they all see it as a grave mistake\nUm\nIt's been a catastrophe from the outset\nAnd pulling out will be just as bad\nThere's no easy way to handle the Middle East, not anymore\nI mean, it's as if we're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole\nUm\nWe can't impose our ways, our democracy, on a people who've for centuries lived by their own codes\nSure, Saddam was a monster, but we must weigh the costs\nUm\nI'm at a loss for words\nUm\nNo reason to stay there now\nUm\nThe administration may have their hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard any that sway me\nUm\nIf we're to leave, let it be gradual, but it's not as if they can't just leave now\nUm\nI've seen the polls, eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone\nUm\nThese are the people we are trying to save\nUm\nWe should listen to them, ask if we should leave, and if they say yes, at least we'll have their blessing\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help out again, well, we'll at least be the ones who asked\nUm\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but we'll be better than we are now\nUm\nNo",
            "Now, the matter of gender discrimination, it runs deep in this land, like a river carved by time. Not merely against women, but in every sector of labor, it festers. The glass ceiling, that mythical barrier of supposed equality, it is a constant stone in the shoe of ambition.\n\nIn the corporate world, a woman may stand tall, possessing every qualification for a position, yet the board may shrink from her, for society has long seen men as the natural leaders. A woman, in this predicament, is like a lioness in a den of hyenas, her power acknowledged but never truly accepted. The same can be said for men in fields like fashion, where the male presence is often met with skepticism. Society whispers, \"How can a man know feminine tastes?\" as if it is a secret language known only to women.\n\nThe change, it is a slow process, like a river carving stone. Women, they are climbing ladders of success, reaching heights once deemed unattainable. Yet, the pace is slow, the climb arduous. Change, it is not a storm that sweeps away the old, but a gentle rain that wears away the stone.\n\nAnd then there are those who defy societal norms, like the man who chooses to stay at home, to raise his children. Society looks askance, whispering, \"What man would choose to stay at home?\" as if it is a sign of weakness. Yet, these men, they are not weak, but strong in their choice to nurture, to guide the next generation. They are the silent rebels, the quiet revolutionaries.\n\nIn the fashion industry, a man's place is often questioned. \"How can he know the female psyche?\" they ask, as if it is a foreign language. Yet, these men, they are not mere mimics, but interpreters, translating the world of fashion into a language that transcends gender.\n\nDiscrimination, it is not merely about gender, but about every aspect of a person. A man from the farm, with rough hands and grammar like a river's roar, may stand before a room of men, his intelligence unquestioned, but his grammar a stumbling block. \"How can we trust him?\" they ask, as if a man's worth is measured by the rules of grammar.\n\nYes, discrimination, it is a serpent that coils around every aspect of society. Change, it is coming, but it is not a storm, but a slow, steady rain. We must be patient, and persistent, for the stone will yield, and the river will carve a new path.",
            "In my apprehension, the matter at hand is not that they have legalized it, no. They have decriminalized it, reduced the sin from a criminal transgression to a trifle, akin to a speeding ticket. It is a mere citation now, no need for the clanking of cuffs or the cold embrace of the jailhouse. A marijuana charge, once a stain on one's record, now holds less weight, though the stigma persists. The specter of a drug charge looms large in the minds of the youth, as it does in any aspirant's. The decriminalization, while lessening the burden on the courts and the coffers, does not erase the stain entirely. Yet, it is a step forward, a recognition of the fact that the price of prosecution is high, and the cost of incarceration, higher still.\n\nDenver, with its peculiar brand of openness, has embraced this change. Their coffers, once emptied by the endless prosecution of the pot heads, are now filled. Schools have been built, elder care funded, and the hungry fed. It is a testament to the power of policy change, to the fact that sometimes, less is more.\n\nBut, is it right to have marijuana on every corner, like the stench of smoke from the factory? No, I think not. It is a taboo, a vice, and it should remain so. The effects of marijuana, though not as immediate as alcohol, can be just as insidious. It is a poison, a sedative, a blight on the mind. Yet, it is not a one-size-fits-all vice. Some men, they can handle it, exercise moderation, and walk a narrow path. Others, they cannot. They embrace it, and it consumes them.\n\nIt is a complex beast, this decriminalization. It is not the answer to all our ills, nor is it the harbinger of doom. It is a step, a compromises, a recognition that the old ways are not working. It is a conversation, a dialogue, a recognition that we must address the elephant in the room. And in the end, it is a choice, a choice to be made by each of us, as individuals, as communities, as a society. And it is a choice we must make with our eyes wide open, our minds clear, and our hearts heavy with the weight of the consequences.",
            "I'd say yes, in a way. For so long as the flame burns, it is wise to retain the embers of tradition. Though the embers glow with a familiar warmth, they must not be allowed to smother the winds of change. This is the dance of faith, a tango of continuity and adaptation, both necessary for a soul's sustenance.\n\nThe Catholic Church, as vast as the desert, has seen its share of the sun and the shadow. Its traditions, like the ancient oak, stand firm and proud. Yet, the roots of the tree must bend with the shifting earth lest they snap in the storm. The weekly pilgrimage to the church, the rigid observance of doctrine, they all echo the echoes of the past. But the past is not a prison, and the Church must never forget its teachings on love, for it is a love that transcends the boundaries of dogma.\n\nMy parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, could not find solace in the same house of God. The Church, in its rigidity, turned a blind eye to the union of their hearts. This is not the path of the truly devout, who seek to love as they are loved. It is a contradiction, as vast as the cosmos, that the Church preaches love while closing its doors to those who do not fit the mold.\n\nThe priests, the guardians of the faith, are not immune to the darkness within. Marriage, they say, would assuage the beast, but I question it. For the beast is not sated by the embrace of a spouse, but by the innocents it preys upon. Allowing priests to wed would not stop the rot within, for the rot is not in the vows of marriage, but in the hearts of men themselves. Allowing them to wed, I believe, would only shift the sands, not extinguish the flame.",
            "Now, listen here, I haven't made any decision on this here matter yet. It's a right tight thing, it is. The church and the state, they're close enough that you can't tug 'em apart without causing a damn ruckus. And marriage, well, that's a tricky thing too. The government wants to define it, but they don't want to offend no one. Civil unions, that's what they call it. But is it really a marriage? It's just two people, joined together. Shouldn't the government leave it at that? And what about the constitution, they want to amend it to ban gay marriage. That's ridiculous, it is. The constitution's not a place for such a small cause, it ain't. It's not important enough to amend, don't you see? No, it isn't.",
            "In the hardscrabble crucible of my upbringing, I was cradled in the tenets of a Christian household. Yet, the labyrinth of my mind is not so easily confined to such rigid beliefs. Homosexuality, to me, is a realm of gray areas, a shadowed expanse where the light of understanding is but a flickering candle. For I am acquainted with many who tread that path, and though I do not walk it myself, I do not deny them the freedom to do so.\n\nThe question of its legality, though, is a matter of state's rights. In this vast and varied land, where the winds of democracy and the tides of conservatism ebb and flow, it seems only right that each state should decide for itself whether to legalize this union. For what is a nation but a collection of sovereign parts, each with its own voice and will?\n\nI stand firm in my belief that all should be afforded equality under the law, that no one should be denied the opportunities that others take for granted. It is a matter of justice, plain and simple. The federal government, with its distant and often capricious authority, should not impose its will upon the people. It is up to each state to decide what is best for its citizens, to hear their voices and act accordingly.\n\nTo suggest that a single president, no matter how long they may remain in office, can dictate the will of the entire nation is as absurd as claiming the sun rises only in Texas. This is a land of states, each with its own character, its own soul. It is not the business of one man or one party to decide what is right for all. Let the states decide, and let the people live with the consequences.\n\nI am not here to argue, but to speak the truth as I see it. It is a truth that echoes through the silence of the wilderness, a truth that says, \"Let each man and woman stand for themselves, and let each state stand for its own people.\"",
            "Now, let me see here. That ain't to be taken as such a private affair, no sir. Everything you post on the internet, it's there for the world to see. It's like the wind, blowing where it may. And if the school officials should happen to stumble upon it, well, that's just the way it is.\n\nJust like if you're posting about such things as drinking or smoking or what have you, you're asking for it. It's a public thing, and the school has a responsibility to ensure it's a safe place for all. If it's something that's gonna keep the kids safe, then by all means, they should be checking.\n\nBut if they're just going to snoop around, that's a different story. That's like sticking your nose where it ain't wanted. But if it's for the safety of the school, then I reckon it's all right.\n\nIt's a bit like when you're at the water's edge, and you see something there that might be harmful. You check it out, you see if it's safe. If it's not, you warn the others. That's what they're doing with these here internet things, checking if there's something harmful floating about.\n\nNow, I ain't one to be surprised about how careless folks can be. It's like I once told a teacher of mine, \"If you post something online, it's like you're painting it on the side of a building. You can't take it down, not once it's seen.\" And if a person's gotta go to college, they'd best remember that. They're gonna be judged on what they've done and said before, and it's gonna stay with 'em. That's just the way it is.\n\nI mean, if something's leading to a safer place for the students, then fine, check it out. But if it's just for catching folks in trouble, that's a different matter. That's like hunting a man just for the sport of it. Not right, not at all.\n\nAnd I say this: If parents drop off their kids at school, they expect a place of safety. And the school officials are just doing their job, making sure that place is safe. It's like the drills we used to do, back in high school. They were for the safety of all. And that's what they're doing here, making sure nothing bad happens. Like that tragic business at Columbine. That could have been prevented with just a bit of looking out.\n\nSo that's all I've got to say. That's all I can figure on.",
            "Ah, the war. A wretched affair, it was. At first, I was all for it, you see. The specter of nine-eleven still lingered heavy, and I thought, perhaps, we should repay them in kind. But now, I'm not so sure. I reckon we were blinded by emotion, by the desire for vengeance. We stormed their lands, unprepared, unplanned. A fool's errand, it was.\n\nI do believe the people there, they're caught in a cycle of violence, of chaos. They can't seem to turn it off, can't turn it toward anything else but each other. And we, we're just a distraction. A foreign force, trying to impose order on a land that's already been torn asunder. It's futile, I tell you. Like trying to tame a wild beast, you can only do so much before it turns on you.\n\nWe went in there seeking revenge, and we got it. But at what cost? The people there, they're not like us. Their war is not our war. They fight for different reasons, with different rules. And in the end, they'll be just as they were before we arrived. We can't change that.\n\nPresident Bush, he was a man driven by emotion, by the desire to do something, anything. And the people, they wanted action. But it was a hasty decision, a decision made in the heat of the moment. We didn't have a plan, a strategy. We were like children with a toy, playing at war. And look where it's gotten us.\n\nNow, I don't know. I don't know if we've made any progress. I see the rebuilding, but it's like trying to repair a house with a leaking roof. You can patch it up, but it'll still rain inside. We can't stay there forever, and once we leave, what then? Another cycle of violence, of chaos. It's a vicious circle, and we're just a part of it.\n\nBut enough of this. I've said my piece. The war, it's a mistake. A mistake we're all paying for."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church, in its current form, stands embattled. Its stance on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control seems to have become anachronistic, alienating those who espouse differing views. The Church's unyielding stances on these issues have not only sparked discord but also dwindled its flock. In this age of shifting societal norms, the Church's perspective appears outdated, a relic of a bygone era. Could a more contemporary outlook on these matters reinvigorate its following? Perhaps, but the path to adaptation is fraught with challenges. The Church's resistance to change, its rigid stance, and its refusal to acknowledge the shifting tides of societal opinion have led many to turn away, seeking more progressive and accepting communities. This exodus is understandable. For those who support abortion rights or advocate for same-sex marriage, following a Church that condemns their beliefs can be akin to spiritual martyrdom. The Church's insistence on celibacy for priests, though steadfast, seems anachronistic in a world where marriage and family are widely accepted as integral parts of life. Would allowing priests to marry or ordain women truly change the Church's trajectory? It is difficult to say, as the Church's current structure has long been established, resistant to change. Yet, in a world that is continually evolving, perhaps the time has come for the Church to reckon with its past and embrace a new path, one that is more inclusive and adaptable to the winds of change.",
            "I'm not one to stand against the union of two souls, be they of differing sexes or the same. It's not a choice, not something one can pick up and put down like a hat. They are who they are, born of flesh and blood, as you and I. It's not a conscious decision, like choosing one's favorite shade of whiskey. They shouldn't be held accountable for their inclinations, for it's as natural as the sun rising. It's not a matter for the federal government to step in on. They should mind their own business, leave the people alone. It's not a moral issue, nor a legal one. It's just life, raw and unfiltered. Let them be, let them love, for it's the only way to be truly free.",
            "I believe gay marriage should be legalized, for there are no compelling reasons against it. Many argue that such unions pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is a misguided notion. It is a matter of perspective, a different side of the same coin, if you will. Heads and tails, yet they are the same in essence. Moreover, civil rights extend to homosexual couples, encompassing property taxes and healthcare, where one’s partner cannot visit or be present during illness if not technically family. This seems silly, given the lifelong commitment shared. Scientific studies, a hot topic as it is, reveal that homosexual couples experience similar relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual ones.\n\nThey do not seek the right to wed in a church but merely a legal marriage certificate from the government. Separation of church and state should be respected, and if one is granted civil unions, why not marriages? It is akin to segregation, separate but unequal. The community may worry about adoption and how children of gay couples will fare, but parenting skills are identical, and children will adapt as they always do.\n\nThe federal government should intervene to legalize gay marriage in all states, opposing the amendment. However, President Bush's strong beliefs on the matter, rooted in his religious views, present a challenge. His stance on abortion and stem cell research is similarly rooted in morality, which differs among individuals. The government embracing one group's morality while ignoring others is unethical, hypocritical given the recent controversies surrounding religious standards in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany oppose gay marriage due to the belief that homosexuality is a result of psychological damage or trauma. This is unfounded, as the American Psychological Association has debunked such notions. Ignoring scientific research and relying on popular opinion is detrimental. Institutions that conduct studies on these subjects should be trusted over personal beliefs and religious doctrine.",
            "Well, first off, I'm employed at the hospital pharmacy for the summer. Now, I ain't no lawyer or politician, but I can tell you this: just 'cause a drug is illegal don't mean it ain't got any good in it. You see, I'm talking 'bout marijuana.\n\nYou know, the world's got a habit of turning its back on something 'cause it's deemed illegal. But the truth is, there's a whole world of benefits hidden behind that stigma. Now, I ain't saying it should be handed out to children or fools, but for medicinal purposes? Hell yeah, I'd say it's worth considering. After all, look at all the controlled substances we use in hospitals every day - oxycodone, vicodin, percocets. They ain't exactly the brightest of the bunch, but they do their job, and that's what matters.\n\nNow, you might be thinking, well, what about the abuse? Well, let me tell you, alcohol's just as harmful when it's abused. But we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, do we? No, we integrate it gradually, legalize it responsibly. And that's what we need to do with marijuana. First, we gotta chip away at that taboo, get rid of that nasty image they've got painted up there. Make people see it for what it is - not some horrid thing, but a plant with potential.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say it's time we took a step back, looked at the facts, and embrace the benefits. Who knows, maybe we'll find a way to make it work for everybody.",
            "In these times, the church has adapted to the twenty-first century, though not in the rigid manner of yore. The dress code, once as strict as the Ten Commandments, has loosened, as have the trappings of worship. Sundays, once filled with the solemnity of youthful piety, have given way to the casualness of modern life. Gone are the days of matching dresses, shoes, and purses; now, the masses are shortened to mere thirty minutes, and the congregation dresses as if they've just stepped from the sand, salt still clinging to their skin. The church, once a place of unyielding formality, is now a sanctuary of relaxed informality.\n\nAs for the accusations against the Catholic Church, I cannot say with certainty what could have been done to prevent the darkness that has unfolded. Some may claim that allowing female priests or permitting marriage would have made a difference, but I am not convinced. For the malady of pedophilia, it seems a matter of genetics, not choice or circumstance. The beast within does not yield to the sanctity of marriage or the piety of a calling. Had the church been privy to such darkness and covered it up, shame be upon them. But I do not believe all were aware, and thus, no redemption can be found in hindsight.",
            "Well, this here, it's a tale of deceit and bloodshed, and I reckon it all began with the September 11th attacks. The wind of war blew through the nation, and the Bush administration, they latched onto it, claiming Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to Bin Laden. Lies, all lies, and the people, they swallowed them whole, eyes wide with fear and grief.\n\nI remember the Bush administration's words like a bad penny, always turning up, always telling tales that didn't add up. Colin Powell, he stood at the UN, his voice like a tolling bell, and now, in hindsight, he says he wasn't convinced. That's malfeasance, that's a stain on the office, an impeachable offense. They lied to us, the American people, and they're still liars today.\n\nThe Iraq war, it's like a cancer, eating away at the heart of the United States. The younger Bush, he had a score to settle with Saddam Hussein, a blood vengeance burning in his eyes. And oil, they were after the oil, the black gold, a river of wealth. It's all underhanded, a snake in the grass, and it's gone on too long.\n\nNow, they say we can't withdraw, not yet. Civil war, they say, and more bloodshed. A coalition of nations, Syria and Saudi Arabia, they're coming in, trying to right the ship. But it's a raft of troubles, that's what it is. Iraq's sovereignty, it's like a ghost, haunting the halls of power. The interim government, it's a house of cards, ready to crumble. The Parliament, it's a powder keg, filled with radical elements vying for control.\n\nNone of it, none of it, is good for polite company.

            "I reckon that it ain't right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as such. The constitution, it speaks clear as day about the separation of church and state. It's a line that's been drawn in the sand, and I reckon tampering with it would be a defiance of what's already been written in stone. Now, there's them out there who'd see it made illegal, but that's just one church's belief over another. The Catholics and Christians, they're against it, save for a few in Boston and such. But I don't think it's the government's place to decide what a church can or can't make illegal. Separation, it's been a key part of this here constitution, and that's what allows for religious tolerance in this land. And even if they were to make an amendment, it'd be a step in the wrong direction. It'd be the only amendment to restrict the people, and that ain't right. No, I don't think the federal government or any government should be involved. It's personal beliefs, nothing more, driving this push for an amendment. It's about one religion over every other, and that ain't fair. I reckon it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government. And there ain't no reason to amend it, except for personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society, I reckon. That's all I got to say.",
            "In the dark, murky waters of Iraq, a nation's fate has been set ablaze by the iron fist of American might. The government, with a tongue as slick as the desert sand, spun a web of deceit, binding the people to the war machine that was to come. The 9/11 specter was invoked, a shadow of terror that twisted the minds of the masses, and the invasion of Iraq, a preemptive strike, was the result of this twisted dance. I, myself, stood against the tide of war, particularly a strike that was more impetuous than strategic.\n\nThe echoes of Vietnam resonated in Iraq, a ghostly echo of past mistakes. The removal of a government, the vacuum of power, the chaos that followed - these were not the fruits of a well-planned harvest. The American government, it seemed, had not learned from the past, and the cost was high. The blood of American soldiers stained the sands, and yet the task of building a democracy in a land torn apart by war had barely begun.\n\nThe government attempted to mask the uncertainty and chaos that followed the invasion, presenting it as a clear, swift victory. But I saw the truth, a grim shadow that refused to be banished. The task of rebuilding a nation was not one to be rushed, nor was it a simple matter of training an army to replace the old regime. It was a long, arduous journey, much like our own struggle for democracy, and the government's portrayal of it as an easy task was a lie.\n\nIn the election of 2004, I weighed the candidates, their promises, their plans. It was a difficult choice, for the war had become a part of our reality, a grim specter that followed us. The question remained: how could we abandon those we had liberated? The cost was high, the risk great, and the goal was unclear. The oil, the resources, the need to control - these were the true reasons behind the invasion, not the weapons of mass destruction that were never found.\n\nAs the war drags on, I hope for peace, but I know it will not come easily. The path to a free, democratic Iraq is long and fraught with peril, and the government's promises of a swift victory were nothing more than the same old lies. The war in Iraq, like a cancer, continues to fester, a grim reminder of the cost of war and the deceit of those who would lead us into it.",
            "Well, I reckon I should set my thoughts on this matter straight. I've always been of the mind that a person's inclination towards any manner of love or affection is a personal and intimate affair, not something to be dictated by the whims of law or the pious pronouncements of the powerful. It's been proven, or so I've heard from learned folk, that this predisposition has more to do with our biology than our upbringing. It ain't something that can be controlled or changed, much like the color of one's eyes or the curve of one's smile.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, I've seen it firsthand. There are those who choose to love in a way that don't fit the mold of traditional expectations. They walk their dogs, they tend their gardens, they live their lives just like anyone else. But they're denied the same rights as their neighbors simply because their love don't follow the societal script.\n\nAnd all this talk about marriage being a sacred institution, well, that's a mighty convenient thing for them to say, don't you think? As if it's not something that can be done in private, without the prying eyes of the government or the sanctimonious gaze of the pious. If a man and a woman want to tie the knot, they can do it in a heartbeat, with barely a whisper. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's a spectacle, a headline.\n\nIt's my belief, and I've heard it said by others too, that this inclination is something written into our very being, something that can't be changed or shamed away. It's as natural as the sun rising or the moon setting. And it's high time we started treating it as such. It's not a political issue, it's a matter of basic humanity.",

You see, when you place something on the internet, it becomes a part of the collective consciousness, a public forum for all to peruse and scrutinize.\n\nIn the realm of the digital frontier, there is no sanctuary. The wind of rumor can carry your words far and wide, reaching even the most distant corners. If you speak of blowing things up, or of shootings, you can be assured that some will take your words to heart, and the echoes of your voice may reach the ears of those who wield power and authority.\n\nThe internet is not a place for the faint of heart; it is a place where truth and error can become entwined, where the actions of a few can cast a shadow over the many. It is a place where the innocent can be mistaken for the guilty, and the guilty can escape unpunished. The line between jest and malice can blur, and one must tread carefully lest they fall into the abyss.\n\nIn the face of such uncertainty, the school officials must act, for they are the guardians of the flock. They cannot ignore the cry of alarm, for to do so would be to invite disaster upon their heads. Yet, they must also be wary, for not all warnings are worthy of heed. Some may be the gambols of youthful folly, or the harmless musings of a mind at play.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, this dance between freedom and responsibility. If you do not wish your words to be seen, then do not place them where they may be found. The internet is a public forum, and all who enter must be prepared to bear the consequences of their actions. It is a harsh and unforgiving world, and one must tread carefully lest they find themselves lost in its wilderness.",
            "In the vast, bleak expanse of time, this war has stretched on like a tireless plague, its purpose, once clear as the first light of day, now lost in the mire of its own duration. In the beginning, it was said we fought to bring democracy to a land where none held sway. A noble cause, it seemed, yet now, the motivations seem clouded, tainted by the personal enmities of a past long since passed. Bush Senior's old grievances with Hussein, the echoes of which still linger in the halls of power, cast a shadow over this endeavor. Yet, if the purpose was once to free a people from a tyrant's grip, then it was a cause worthy of our attention. But we have strayed from this path, lost in the labyrinth of our own hubris.\n\nThe war's inception was a stark declaration, a bold stroke on the canvas of history. But the subsequent years, they've been a desolate wasteland, a test of endurance rather than a battle for victory. We've become a people content to fight for the sake of fighting, to prove our might, our power. Yet, in this endless cycle of violence, we've lost sight of the cause that birthed us.\n\nThe economy, our own, bleeds red from this war. It is a wound that does not heal, a drain that cannot be stopped. Our own citizens suffer, their needs unmet, while abroad, we pour billions into a conflict that has lost its meaning. Poverty, roads, schools, healthcare - these are the battles we should be fighting, the causes we should be championing. Yet, we squander our resources on a war that has become a shadow of its former self, a ghost that haunts the landscape.\n\nIt is time, I think, for this war to end. For the people of this land to stand on their own two feet, to face their own demons. We have done what we could, and then some. But now, we must step back, let them face the sun and the wind, and the storms that will inevitably come. For it is their land, their people, their future that should concern them. Not ours.\n\nThe time has come to withdraw, to leave the battlefield and tend to our own. The war, it has gone on long enough. It is time to bring our sons and daughters home, to tend to the wounds of a nation that has seen too much bloodshed, and not enough progress. It is time to build, to heal, to grow. For it is in peace that true strength is found, in the quiet moments between the battles.",
            "Can I pose a query for clarification, please?\n\nSeems to me, this matter was circumvented because someone took it upon themselves to surf the web and uncover certain information. I'm not one to contend that this constitutes an invasion of privacy. On platforms such as Myspace, if one chooses to share their life, it's a fair indication that they expect others to see it. Of course, one must ascertain the terms of such exposure. Myspace, for instance, necessitates mutual agreement to view another's profile. You must accept someone as a \"friend\" for their information to be accessible. When one posts anything online, they implicitly consent to a broad audience.\n\nYet, the issue is complex. Is it feasible for a single individual to monitor every student's profile in a school to prevent such occurrences? It could be seen as discriminatory if the intent is to scrutinize the \"bad\" students. However, if the profile was stumbled upon during an actual investigation, it might be justified. I'm uncertain.\n\nIn my experience, I have no Myspace of my own but I do possess a Facebook. It troubles me to know that there are individuals who can glean personal information from such a platform. I've seen a television report about a man who easily found a young girl's screen name and convinced her to meet him within minutes. I wouldn't entertain such a request, but some of my acquaintances have encountered strangers knowing their online persona. It's an uncomfortable situation. I limit what I post, but I also understand the need to communicate with friends. The challenge lies in balancing privacy and connection.\n\nMy roommate shared a tale of her high school days, where students were prohibited from having Myspace accounts by the school. I found that peculiar. I wasn't sure how school officials could impose such restrictions. It seems a grey area, a privacy issue perhaps, but I'm not convinced they have the authority to dictate such limitations. That's the extent of my thoughts on the matter.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe've just this and one more thing to discuss, regarding the Iraq War\nUm\nI feel a certain measure of hypocrisy in speaking of it\nUm\nI was against it from the start, but it's not as if it matters now\nThe world at large, the Iraqis, even the U.S. troops over there now, they all see it as a grave mistake\nUm\nIt's been a catastrophe from the outset\nAnd pulling out will be just as bad\nThere's no easy way to handle the Middle East, not anymore\nI mean, it's as if we're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole\nUm\nWe can't impose our ways, our democracy, on a people who've for centuries lived by their own codes\nSure, Saddam was a monster, but we must weigh the costs\nUm\nI'm at a loss for words\nUm\nNo reason to stay there now\nUm\nThe administration may have their hopeful ideas, but I haven't heard any that sway me\nUm\nIf we're to leave, let it be gradual, but it's not as if they can't just leave now\nUm\nI've seen the polls, eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone\nUm\nThese are the people we are trying to save\nUm\nWe should listen to them, ask if we should leave, and if they say yes, at least we'll have their blessing\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help out again, well, we'll at least be the ones who asked\nUm\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but we'll be better than we are now\nUm\nNo",
            "Now, the matter of gender discrimination, it runs deep in this land, like a river carved by time. Not merely against women, but in every sector of labor, it festers. The glass ceiling, that mythical barrier of supposed equality, it is a constant stone in the shoe of ambition.\n\nIn the corporate world, a woman may stand tall, possessing every qualification for a position, yet the board may shrink from her, for society has long seen men as the natural leaders. A woman, in this predicament, is like a lioness in a den of hyenas, her power acknowledged but never truly accepted. The same can be said for men in fields like fashion, where the male presence is often met with skepticism. Society whispers, \"How can a man know feminine tastes?\" as if it is a secret language known only to women.\n\nThe change, it is a slow process, like a river carving stone. Women, they are climbing ladders of success, reaching heights once deemed unattainable. Yet, the pace is slow, the climb arduous. Change, it is not a storm that sweeps away the old, but a gentle rain that wears away the stone.\n\nAnd then there are those who defy societal norms, like the man who chooses to stay at home, to raise his children. Society looks askance, whispering, \"What man would choose to stay at home?\" as if it is a sign of weakness. Yet, these men, they are not weak, but strong in their choice to nurture, to guide the next generation. They are the silent rebels, the quiet revolutionaries.\n\nIn the fashion industry, a man's place is often questioned. \"How can he know the female psyche?\" they ask, as if it is a foreign language. Yet, these men, they are not mere mimics, but interpreters, translating the world of fashion into a language that transcends gender.\n\nDiscrimination, it is not merely about gender, but about every aspect of a person. A man from the farm, with rough hands and grammar like a river's roar, may stand before a room of men, his intelligence unquestioned, but his grammar a stumbling block. \"How can we trust him?\" they ask, as if a man's worth is measured by the rules of grammar.\n\nYes, discrimination, it is a serpent that coils around every aspect of society. Change, it is coming, but it is not a storm, but a slow, steady rain. We must be patient, and persistent, for the stone will yield, and the river will carve a new path.",
            "In my apprehension, the matter at hand is not that they have legalized it, no. They have decriminalized it, reduced the sin from a criminal transgression to a trifle, akin to a speeding ticket. It is a mere citation now, no need for the clanking of cuffs or the cold embrace of the jailhouse. A marijuana charge, once a stain on one's record, now holds less weight, though the stigma persists. The specter of a drug charge looms large in the minds of the youth, as it does in any aspirant's. The decriminalization, while lessening the burden on the courts and the coffers, does not erase the stain entirely. Yet, it is a step forward, a recognition of the fact that the price of prosecution is high, and the cost of incarceration, higher still.\n\nDenver, with its peculiar brand of openness, has embraced this change. Their coffers, once emptied by the endless prosecution of the pot heads, are now filled. Schools have been built, elder care funded, and the hungry fed. It is a testament to the power of policy change, to the fact that sometimes, less is more.\n\nBut, is it right to have marijuana on every corner, like the stench of smoke from the factory? No, I think not. It is a taboo, a vice, and it should remain so. The effects of marijuana, though not as immediate as alcohol, can be just as insidious. It is a poison, a sedative, a blight on the mind. Yet, it is not a one-size-fits-all vice. Some men, they can handle it, exercise moderation, and walk a narrow path. Others, they cannot. They embrace it, and it consumes them.\n\nIt is a complex beast, this decriminalization. It is not the answer to all our ills, nor is it the harbinger of doom. It is a step, a compromises, a recognition that the old ways are not working. It is a conversation, a dialogue, a recognition that we must address the elephant in the room. And in the end, it is a choice, a choice to be made by each of us, as individuals, as communities, as a society. And it is a choice we must make with our eyes wide open, our minds clear, and our hearts heavy with the weight of the consequences.",
            "I'd say yes, in a way. For so long as the flame burns, it is wise to retain the embers of tradition. Though the embers glow with a familiar warmth, they must not be allowed to smother the winds of change. This is the dance of faith, a tango of continuity and adaptation, both necessary for a soul's sustenance.\n\nThe Catholic Church, as vast as the desert, has seen its share of the sun and the shadow. Its traditions, like the ancient oak, stand firm and proud. Yet, the roots of the tree must bend with the shifting earth lest they snap in the storm. The weekly pilgrimage to the church, the rigid observance of doctrine, they all echo the echoes of the past. But the past is not a prison, and the Church must never forget its teachings on love, for it is a love that transcends the boundaries of dogma.\n\nMy parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, could not find solace in the same house of God. The Church, in its rigidity, turned a blind eye to the union of their hearts. This is not the path of the truly devout, who seek to love as they are loved. It is a contradiction, as vast as the cosmos, that the Church preaches love while closing its doors to those who do not fit the mold.\n\nThe priests, the guardians of the faith, are not immune to the darkness within. Marriage, they say, would assuage the beast, but I question it. For the beast is not sated by the embrace of a spouse, but by the innocents it preys upon. Allowing priests to wed would not stop the rot within, for the rot is not in the vows of marriage, but in the hearts of men themselves. Allowing them to wed, I believe, would only shift the sands, not extinguish the flame.",
            "Now, listen here, I haven't made any decision on this here matter yet. It's a right tight thing, it is. The church and the state, they're close enough that you can't tug 'em apart without causing a damn ruckus. And marriage, well, that's a tricky thing too. The government wants to define it, but they don't want to offend no one. Civil unions, that's what they call it. But is it really a marriage? It's just two people, joined together. Shouldn't the government leave it at that? And what about the constitution, they want to amend it to ban gay marriage. That's ridiculous, it is. The constitution's not a place for such a small cause, it ain't. It's not important enough to amend, don't you see? No, it isn't.",
            "In the hardscrabble crucible of my upbringing, I was cradled in the tenets of a Christian household. Yet, the labyrinth of my mind is not so easily confined to such rigid beliefs. Homosexuality, to me, is a realm of gray areas, a shadowed expanse where the light of understanding is but a flickering candle. For I am acquainted with many who tread that path, and though I do not walk it myself, I do not deny them the freedom to do so.\n\nThe question of its legality, though, is a matter of state's rights. In this vast and varied land, where the winds of democracy and the tides of conservatism ebb and flow, it seems only right that each state should decide for itself whether to legalize this union. For what is a nation but a collection of sovereign parts, each with its own voice and will?\n\nI stand firm in my belief that all should be afforded equality under the law, that no one should be denied the opportunities that others take for granted. It is a matter of justice, plain and simple. The federal government, with its distant and often capricious authority, should not impose its will upon the people. It is up to each state to decide what is best for its citizens, to hear their voices and act accordingly.\n\nTo suggest that a single president, no matter how long they may remain in office, can dictate the will of the entire nation is as absurd as claiming the sun rises only in Texas. This is a land of states, each with its own character, its own soul. It is not the business of one man or one party to decide what is right for all. Let the states decide, and let the people live with the consequences.\n\nI am not here to argue, but to speak the truth as I see it. It is a truth that echoes through the silence of the wilderness, a truth that says, \"Let each man and woman stand for themselves, and let each state stand for its own people.\"",
            "Now, let me see here. That ain't to be taken as such a private affair, no sir. Everything you post on the internet, it's there for the world to see. It's like the wind, blowing where it may. And if the school officials should happen to stumble upon it, well, that's just the way it is.\n\nJust like if you're posting about such things as drinking or smoking or what have you, you're asking for it. It's a public thing, and the school has a responsibility to ensure it's a safe place for all. If it's something that's gonna keep the kids safe, then by all means, they should be checking.\n\nBut if they're just going to snoop around, that's a different story. That's like sticking your nose where it ain't wanted. But if it's for the safety of the school, then I reckon it's all right.\n\nIt's a bit like when you're at the water's edge, and you see something there that might be harmful. You check it out, you see if it's safe. If it's not, you warn the others. That's what they're doing with these here internet things, checking if there's something harmful floating about.\n\nNow, I ain't one to be surprised about how careless folks can be. It's like I once told a teacher of mine, \"If you post something online, it's like you're painting it on the side of a building. You can't take it down, not once it's seen.\" And if a person's gotta go to college, they'd best remember that. They're gonna be judged on what they've done and said before, and it's gonna stay with 'em. That's just the way it is.\n\nI mean, if something's leading to a safer place for the students, then fine, check it out. But if it's just for catching folks in trouble, that's a different matter. That's like hunting a man just for the sport of it. Not right, not at all.\n\nAnd I say this: If parents drop off their kids at school, they expect a place of safety. And the school officials are just doing their job, making sure that place is safe. It's like the drills we used to do, back in high school. They were for the safety of all. And that's what they're doing here, making sure nothing bad happens. Like that tragic business at Columbine. That could have been prevented with just a bit of looking out.\n\nSo that's all I've got to say. That's all I can figure on.",
            "Ah, the war. A wretched affair, it was. At first, I was all for it, you see. The specter of nine-eleven still lingered heavy, and I thought, perhaps, we should repay them in kind. But now, I'm not so sure. I reckon we were blinded by emotion, by the desire for vengeance. We stormed their lands, unprepared, unplanned. A fool's errand, it was.\n\nI do believe the people there, they're caught in a cycle of violence, of chaos. They can't seem to turn it off, can't turn it toward anything else but each other. And we, we're just a distraction. A foreign force, trying to impose order on a land that's already been torn asunder. It's futile, I tell you. Like trying to tame a wild beast, you can only do so much before it turns on you.\n\nWe went in there seeking revenge, and we got it. But at what cost? The people there, they're not like us. Their war is not our war. They fight for different reasons, with different rules. And in the end, they'll be just as they were before we arrived. We can't change that.\n\nPresident Bush, he was a man driven by emotion, by the desire to do something, anything. And the people, they wanted action. But it was a hasty decision, a decision made in the heat of the moment. We didn't have a plan, a strategy. We were like children with a toy, playing at war. And look where it's gotten us.\n\nNow, I don't know. I don't know if we've made any progress. I see the rebuilding, but it's like trying to repair a house with a leaking roof. You can patch it up, but it'll still rain inside. We can't stay there forever, and once we leave, what then? Another cycle of violence, of chaos. It's a vicious circle, and we're just a part of it.\n\nBut enough of this. I've said my piece. The war, it's a mistake. A mistake we're all paying for."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In certain respects, the Catholic Church finds itself in need of change. Their eyes upon the world have grown stale, their hearts unyielding against the winds of change. The Church, once a beacon of faith for many, now finds itself losing its flock, for it clings too tightly to doctrines that the world has outgrown. Consider the matter of gay marriage, abortion, and birth control—issues where the Church's stance is as unyielding as the rock it claims to follow. These positions, though rooted in tradition, are seen as antiquated by many, and the Church's refusal to adapt has driven a wedge between itself and the people. The Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, is an affront to those who believe in a woman's right to choose. And the same can be said for its stance on same-sex marriage, which some view as a breach of their own hearts.\n\nNow, I am not suggesting that the Church should abandon its core beliefs. Rather, I propose that it should consider a more compassionate and inclusive stance. The world outside the Church doors has shifted, and the Church must shift with it. The notion that priests are married to God is one that I, too, respect. Yet, I question why this union must be exclusive. Why not allow them to share their lives with those they love, as we all do? The Church's teachings on celibacy and the lack of female priests have long been a point of contention, and while I cannot guarantee that these changes would have prevented the scandals that have rocked the Church, I believe they would have mitigated some of the anger and disillusionment felt by the faithful.\n\nThe Church is a living thing, not a static monument. It must breathe, move, and adapt to survive. I urge the Church to consider these changes, to open its arms and its heart, and to become once again a beacon of hope and compassion for all people.",
            "Well, I reckon I don't hold a bone to pick with the matter of gay marriage. I mean, it's not like I've given it a great deal of contemplation, mind you, but it just don't seem right to me. It's not as if they can choose to be that way, like it's a conscious decision. I believe that people, be they of a certain persuasion or not, shouldn't be held accountable for how they're born.\n\nI've seen it said that a man and a woman can wed, but not two of the same sex. It seems a crooked sort of thinking to me. It's not like they choose their nature. I was born one way, another man might be born another. It seems a crime to hold them to account for their nature.\n\nNow, the federal government, well, I don't see them having much say in the matter. It ain't like it involves the safety of our land, nor is it a question of morals. It just seems they're sticking their nose in where it ain't wanted. They have no right to interject in the lives of others, least of all those who are born as they are. It's not a sin to be what you are, to be born that way.\n\nNo, I reckon that's about all I have to say on the matter. It's a hard thing to put into words, but I hope it makes sense.",
            "In the desolate expanse of these plains, there exists a conundrum, a divide as vast as the frontier itself. The matter of homosexual matrimony, a topic as intractable as the wilderness, is one that has emerged from the shadows of our past, demanding our attention. Why, then, should this union be denied?\n\nThe notion that such a pairing threatens the sanctity of the heterosexual union is as misguided as believing the sun sets in the east. They are but two aspects of the same coin, each face unique, yet each a valid expression of the human condition. The moral compass of one does not dictate the morality of another.\n\nConsider the civil rights that accompany this union. Property taxes, healthcare, the right to visit a partner in sickness and health. To deny these to those who choose to love differently is as absurd as denying the right of passage to a river that flows in a different direction. The arguments against such a union are thin and devoid of substance, much like the echoes of a ghost town in the wind.\n\nThe fear of adoption and the supposed ill effects on society's children is as unfounded as the fear of the unknown. The children of homosexual couples are as likely to be influenced by their parents' choices as are the children of heterosexual couples. The science is clear: the factors that contribute to a successful relationship are the same, regardless of the gender of the participants. The community, too, should not be feared; it is as likely to be enriched as it is to be changed.\n\nThe federal government, with its vast reach and authority, should intervene in this matter. It is time for the amendment to be reversed, to be made to reflect the reality that love, in all its myriad forms, is a fundamental right. President Bush's stance on this matter is as divisive as his stance on abortion and stem cell research. It is a stance rooted in morality, but a morality as fluid and changeable as the seasons.\n\nIt is a pity that such a stance is often rooted in the religious beliefs of the few, rather than the cultural beliefs of the many. To let religious convictions dictate federal law is as hypocritical as it is undemocratic. It is a betrayal of the nation's founding principles, a rejection of the freedom of belief. To deny the right to marry based on the beliefs of one group is as un-American as it is unjust.\n\nThe notion that homosexuality is a psychological defect or a result of trauma is as baseless as it is harmful. It is a notion that is refuted by the very institutions that have conducted the research. To listen to the voices of the educated and the studied, rather than the whispers of the uninformed and the prejudiced, is the path to understanding.\n\nThis is not a battle between morality and immorality, but a battle between understanding and ignorance. It is a battle that, like the frontier, needs to be fought, and fought with courage, with conviction, and with a heart open to the possibility of change.",
            "Well, first off, I tend to the pharmacy of a hospital come the summer months. It's a harsh world out there, but I've seen the cruel hand that some drugs have on the people. Now, I've heard it said that just because something is illegal, it must be beneficial. But I've seen the other side, too. The side where the law's writ is more a hindrance than a help. I say no, we should not make such things available to the masses. But, for the sake of those that need it, yes, for medicinal purposes, I say yes. The law's power is not absolute, not when it comes to the relief of suffering.\n\nThere are many a substance that's illegal, yet we use them in our pharmacies. Oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet - controlled substances, yes, but beneficial, too. We can't deny their worth, no matter the taboo that surrounds them. Marijuana is no different. It's a complex one, I'll grant you that. But I say, we should embrace its beneficial properties, like we have with others. The key lies in the gradual integration, not the abrupt shattering of the law. Because, you see, we can't just remove the taboo around it. We must first remove the stigma, the fear, the poison that's been fed into the minds of the people.\n\nIt's a tough one. Marijuana, like alcohol, can be abused. But so can alcohol, and that doesn't make it something to be cast aside. The difference lies in the perception, the image. Heroin and cocaine, now there are substances we should be wary of. But marijuana, it's not like that. It's not as harmful, not in the way that others are. And if we can change that perception, if we can let go of the fear and embrace the truth, then perhaps we can use it responsibly. For medicinal purposes, yes. But also for the benefit of those who seek solace in its embrace.",
            "Well, the church, she's a changin', ain't she? It's not as harsh as it once was. I reckon, when I was younger, it was Sundays and the prettiest dresses, matching shoes, too. I'd go to my private school and see all my pals there on weekends. It was somethin', it was.\n\nNow, they've done a turn with the teen masses, cut 'em down to thirty minutes, casual clothes, folks comin' in straight from the beach - I've seen it all. I remember when I'd get dressed up for the mornin' mass, now it's jeans and khakis, even in the heat of summer. The biggest change, I'd say, is the people. The families, they run late, some folks dress casual. It's a different feel.\n\nAs for the rest, I don't claim to know the politics of the church, but I reckon that's about it.\n\nNow, about them priests and their dealings with young'uns... well, I don't hold much water that they could've prevented it. There's men out there, married, and they still got it. It's in 'em, ain't it? Genetic, I reckon. You can't hide that away with a marriage. If they knew and covered it up, shame on 'em.

            "Well, I reckon I was in agreement with the initial narrative, but I tell ya, everyone was still reeling from that September first, and I think we got ourselves into Iraq under false pretenses. There were plenty of lies spun to rope us in, connecting Saddam Hussein to Bin Laden and those September eleventh attacks. We were told of weapons of mass destruction, but those claims proved as hollow as a snowball in hell. It galled me to my core, that's for sure.\n\nThat Bush administration, well, they seemed to have no qualms about deceiving the American people. Even their own dog didn't believe 'em. Colin Powell, he's said as much himself, that he wasn't convinced by that UN presentation. That's more than just a misstep, that's a high crime. A man like that, lying to the people, it's an impeachable offense.\n\nThey had no respect for the Constitution, not since September eleventh. They came into office with war on their mind, and I reckon they were itching for a fight with Saddam Hussein, like a hound after a rabbit. It's all about the oil, if you ask me.\n\nWe can't just up and leave now, though. Withdrawal might just throw the country into chaos, and we've already seen enough death. The coalition of nations they're talking about, Syria and Saudi Arabia, well, that's just asking for more trouble. Iraq's sovereignty, it's hanging by a thread, and their government's about as effective as a wet blanket. That interim government, it's as fractured as a shattered mirror. And let's not forget that old scoundrel, al-Sadr. His party's got a good hold in the Parliament, and they're just one of many trying to grab power. It's a bloody mess, that's for sure.",

Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be defying what's already been laid down. I think them pushing for it to be illegal is like choosing one church's belief over another. Catholics, most of them, they're against it. It's not for the government to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal, is it?\n\nSeparation of church and state, that's been a cornerstone of this here constitution. Making an amendment about it, I reckon that would be wrong. It would be going against what's already been said and written. Plus, it'd be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people, not the government. It's just not right, damn it.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government or any other government should be involved in this. I reckon he's pushing for this amendment just because it's against his own beliefs as a Catholic. It's like he's showing a preference for one religion over another. It should be up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any other government official.\n\nThere ain't no real reason behind this amendment except for his personal views. It ain't gonna impact the economy or society in no way. If anything, it might have a better impact on society than leaving it the way it is. I reckon that's about all I got to say on the matter.",
            "The war in Iraq, it began. A shroud of dishonesty, it was. The government, they said we'd find weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. They played on our grief, our outrage, our desire for vengeance. The invasion, 2003, it came.\n\nI, I was against it. War, it's a cruel beast, and I've seen its handiwork. The Vietnam War, it echoes. We removed their government, but chaos followed. We didn't plan for it, not properly. We planted a democratic seed, like in Vietnam, but it wouldn't grow without sun and rain, without time.\n\nSoldiers, they died. Too many. The government, they sang a different tune, said it'd be quick and clean. But it's been years, and still, we're there. Still, they're dying. We're training Iraqis, but it's slow. Democracy, it doesn't grow overnight, not even in our own land.\n\nThe oil, it's the root. That's why we're there. We control their resources, like we've always done. North Korea, it has weapons, and we do nothing. The government, they're not being truthful, not being thorough. They see dollar signs, not people.\n\nThe election, 2004, I thought about it. Bush, he started something. How can we abandon them now? We took their government, their way of life. But at what cost? American lives, they're precious. How much is too much?\n\nIt's a difficult decision, to leave. We must consider the future. But we must also consider the past, the present. The war, it's a monster, and it won't be easy to tame.\n\nI hope for peace, but I doubt it. It's a long road, and it's just begun.",
            "Let me see now, I reckon. I've always been in favor of that there gay marriage. Always have. It's a personal matter, a choice, you understand? Something that's a part of who a person is, not some stain on their soul. It ain't right to take away rights from folks for something they ain't got control over.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I ain't saying it's all black and white. There's always a gray area, but I believe it's about love, pure and simple. I've seen it with my own eyes. In my neighborhood, there's a few couples, two or three, they're gay, ain't married 'cause they ain't allowed. But they're just like any other family, walkin' their dogs, livin' their lives. It ain't right what Bush was tryin' to do, playin' God with his interpretation of marriage.\n\nIt's a personal thing, not somethin' the government should have a hand in. It's between two people, not the whole nation. I've read it myself, it's somethin' in your brain, a predisposition. It ain't about the way you were raised, it's who you are. It's like the difference between the way a man and a woman are made. It's biology, not sociology.\n\nAnd another thing, it's a private matter, not somethin' everyone needs to know about. If a man and a woman want to get hitched, they can just up and go to Las Vegas. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's big news. It's like they're some kind of spectacle. It's their life, their choice. It's time we let them live it in peace.\n\nNo, it ain't right what's been goin' on. It's not right to deny folks their rights just because they're different. It's time we stand up for what's right.",
            "Listen, I reckon you're aware of this, but let me spell it out for you. When you put something on the internet, you're making it public. As plain as day. No more hiding behind a wall of anonymity. I spoke on this very matter once, when I was an R.A. It's a fact of life, this internet business.\n\nNow, why, you ask, should you be so cautious? Well, consider this: if you're putting out there that you're about to blow things up, or pull a trigger, someone's gonna take notice. And they'll do something about it. Because the internet, it's not just for you and your friends. It's a vast, open plain, where everybody and their dog can be watching.\n\nI recall a time when something was overheard at school. Someone said something, and it was taken seriously. Why? Because the internet's no place for foolishness or jesting. It's a serious business, and what you say can have serious consequences. A sociology experiment gone wrong, maybe. Or perhaps something more dire.\n\nLet me tell you, the internet's a double-edged sword. You put something out there, you're inviting the world to see it. If you don't want it seen, don't put it there. It's as simple as that. You can't dictate what people think or how they take things. You can't control their reactions.\n\nNow, I ain't saying school officials should be snooping around, poking through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those social media contraptions. But if it's brought to their attention, that's a different ballgame. If there's danger, they gotta take it seriously. It's their duty.\n\nYou see, it's all about the line between what's private and what's public. And when it comes to the internet, that line gets mighty thin. So, think before you post. Because out there, in the wide-open internet, there's no hiding.",
            "The conflict has stretched on for an ungodly amount of time, a stain upon the earth that seems to have lost its purpose. Initially, the cause was noble - to restore democracy in a land ravaged by tyranny. But the motives have long since been sullied, like the rain in a drought-stricken land. The wind of war has turned into a howling gale, and we are no longer the lighthouse but the storm itself.\n\nThe war began with a clear purpose, a beacon of righteousness. But like the moon's shadow on the earth, it has grown long and twisted, a shadow of its former self. The initial purpose, to liberate the oppressed, has been eclipsed by a new purpose, one of power and domination. It is as if we are now waging war for the sake of war, a beast that feeds on itself and its own.\n\nThe road to war was paved with the bones of men and the blood of nations. It was once a path of righteousness, to stand against a tyrant. But the path has become a maze, a labyrinth of deceit and greed. We are no longer the saviors we once believed ourselves to be. We are the storm that does not abate, the rain that does not cease.\n\nThe war has become a drain on our very existence, a leech that feeds upon our economy. The money meant for our own shores, for our own people, is being spent in a foreign land, a land that may never know the touch of democracy. It is a blight upon our land, a cancer that must be excised.\n\nThe time has come for the war to end. The officials of that land must stand on their own two feet, as we must stand on ours. We cannot be the crutch that props up nations, for it is a crutch that will lead us to our own downfall. The money spent upon this war is a debt that will never be repaid, a debt that will lead to our own ruin.\n\nThe war must end. It is a futile, endless struggle, a battle that can never be won. It is a war that is no longer worth fighting. It is a war that we must leave behind, like a ghost that haunts a empty house. The time has come to turn our backs on war, to turn our faces towards home.",
            "Well, if I may, I'd like to inquire about this matter. I reckon it was averted due to someone uncannily stumbling upon certain information online. Now, I ain't one to insist on privacy, especially not on these here social sites like Myspace. If you put your life out there, for all the world to see, well, that's on you. It's like opening the gates to your own private sanctum. You might think you're sharing your life with friends, but you're also inviting the scrutiny of strangers. It's a double-edged sword, that's for sure. Now, I ain't got no Myspace myself, but I have me a Facebook. I've seen some sketchy characters out there, lurking in the shadows. I've seen how a person can dig up information like a coyote digging up a rabbit. They can find your name, talk to you, and before you know it, they're asking you to meet. I wouldn't do it, but some of my classmates, they ain't so careful. They don't know who they're talking to, or what they're giving away. It's a tricky business, all right. I only accept people I know, but you never know who might be watching. My roommate told me about her high school days, where they were banned from having Myspace. I reckon that's a bit harsh. I mean, how can they tell folks what they can't do? It ain't right, I tell you. It's a thorny issue, but I reckon it's one we all gotta navigate.",
            "Damn, I reckon we got ourselves in quite the pickle here. The Iraq War, it's been a godforsaken mess from the get-go. I feel like a right son of a bitch talking about it, like I'm just riding the wave of them who were against it from day one. But, hell, it doesn't matter much now, does it? The whole world's seen that it was a bad idea, even our own troops over there think we should be pulling out sooner rather than later. It's a goddamn disaster, and pulling out ain't gonna be no easier.\n\nI mean, look at the polls, will ya? Seventy-five, eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops. It's a goddamn consensus. It's like trying to force a square peg into a round hole. We're trying to bring democracy to a place where it don't belong, and it ain't gonna work. Saddam was a bastard, sure, but we should've weighed the pros and cons before we stomped in there. It was like dancing with the devil, and now we're up to our eyeballs in quicksand.\n\nI don't even know what to make of it all. I sure as hell ain't seen no good reason for us to stay any longer than we should. The administration? They're probably cooking up some hopeful ideas, but I ain't buying it. I've yet to hear a single legitimate reason for staying. If they want to do it gradually, over a year or two, I guess I could stomach it. But why should we stay now? Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, even a quarter of them want us to leave right now. These are the people we're trying to save, and they're telling us to fuck off. Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nAnd if we leave, what then? We'll be the goddamn good guys, won't we? Not really. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we won't be the ones who fucked it all up. We'll be the ones who tried to do what was right. But, who's to say they won't see us as the devils we are? No matter what we do, they'll always hate us.",
            "In these United States of ours, the specter of gender discrimination looms large. It cuts not merely along the lines of sex, but also carves deep into the very fabric of our societal tapestry. In the realm of labor, women, despite their qualifications, often find themselves trapped beneath an invisible glass ceiling, a relic of our collective past that shackles them to lesser positions. This is not to say that men are exempt; they too are not immune to the scourge of discrimination, be it in fashion, where the male figure is often overlooked, or in the domestic sphere, where the stay-at-home father is met with derision and scorn.\n\nThe path to change, however, is a labyrinth of slow progress. We have come far from the dark days of yore, but the march towards equality is a tortoise's pace. The women who claw their way to the upper echelons of business, and the men who choose to nurture their families rather than toil in the fields, are but the vanguard, their success stories slowly chipping away at the old notions that once dominated our minds.\n\nYet, change is also a double-edged sword. It must be wielded with care, lest it provoke a backlash. For every step forward, there are those who resist, who cling to the old ways, who see the new order as a threat to their own. It is a delicate dance, this progression, a slow ballet of acceptance and rejection. And so, we tread carefully, promoting the virtues of those who challenge the status quo, not by force, but by example. For in the end, it is not the loudest voice that wins, but the one that resonates, the one that touches the heart.\n\nBut discrimination, it seems, is not the sole domain of gender. It lurks in the shadows of our backgrounds, our upbringing, our speech. A man from the farm, his grammar rough, may find his intelligence undercut by his roots. His words, like his hands, bear the stigmata of his past, and some will find it difficult to see beyond the surface, to recognize the intellect within. The gendered gaze, then, is but one facet of a larger problem, one that afflicts us all.",
            "Well, they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it, knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more akin to a traffic ticket. You get cited, not booked and arrested. No more of that. And for young folks, the future ramifications are what they worry about. They don't go away, not completely. But there's a cost to all this, you know? Arresting, booking, housing, all of it. And the court dates, the public defenders, the judges, the state's attorney, it all adds up. Municipalities, especially those strapped for cash, they're not inclined to make that kind of concession, even if it'd free up a lot of money to spend on things they really need, like education, social programs, food for the homeless. I mean, it's not like we want marijuana to be everywhere, on every corner. And there are reasons why it shouldn't be. I don't know how I'd feel about it being like cigarettes, sold everywhere, smoked everywhere. It's still taboo in a lot of places. And it's not like either substance is completely harmless. Some people react differently, some people can handle it, some can't. It's not that simple. But I guess what I'm saying is, both have their own adverse effects. But I don't know.",
            "I would say yes, for I have witnessed much that is traditional in these matters, as if time itself has little sway upon their actions. It is good to be rooted, to remain steadfast in ways that have been handed down through generations. Yet, it is also vital to be adaptable, to find the balance between the old and the new. In this, the Catholic Church finds itself in a peculiar state. The weekly gathering, the rituals, the strict adherence to doctrine - these are not without their merit. Yet, there is a coldness in the way they view those who do not conform to their teachings, a lack of tolerance for the beliefs of others. It seems hypocritical, for we are taught to love all, yet are told to shun those who do not share our faith. My father, an Episcopalian, was refused the sacraments because of his belief. This is not tolerance, but divisiveness. The doctrine speaks of love, yet the practice is steeped in the dated trappings of centuries past. It is a struggle to reconcile the two.\n\nYet, I do not believe this would necessarily influence the behavior of those who have fallen so gravely from grace. The molestation of children is not a matter of marital status, but a dark seed that has taken root in the soul. A priest's marriage would not change the nature of his transgressions, for his actions are not born of conjugal relations, but of his own twisted heart. Allowing priests to marry would not prevent such horrors, for they are not the product of marital status, but of the depravity of the individual. It is a different realm entirely.",
            "I find myself at a crossroads, not yet firm in my stance on this contentious issue. The matter of church and state's separation, and the definition of marriage, is a labyrinth of thorny complexities that lie at the heart of our modern society. It is a tangled web, one that demands careful navigation to avoid offending those who walk its precarious path.\n\nI am of the opinion that marriage, in its secular form, should be recognized as a civil union. After all, what is marriage but a union of two souls, regardless of their beliefs or the rituals that bind them? If we are to maintain a separation of church and state, then the government should not delve into the intricacies of marriage, be it religious or otherwise. It is a union, a contract between two people, and no more.\n\nIf each state were to arrive at a consensus, then by all means, let them push for federal recognition. Yet, amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage is an absurdity. Such an amendment would be a stain on the sacred document we hold dear, a stain that would be remembered for generations to come. It is a cause that may be important to some, but it is not vital enough to warrant such a drastic measure. The constitution should not be amended for the sake of a single, albeit passionate, minority.\n\nSo, no, I cannot say that I support such an amendment. It goes against the very spirit of our nation, a spirit that was forged in the fires of diversity and tolerance.",
            "In the crucible of my youth, I was forged in a home sanctified by the teachings of a certain faith. The matter of homosexuality, then, is a labyrinthine conundrum, for I have known many friends whose hearts are inclined in ways that differ from the norm. Though I may not align with their path, I contend that this should not be a matter of national import but a matter of state's discretion. The republic is a tapestry woven with various hues, each state a distinct thread, and no single leader should presume to dictate the moral fabric of all. The winds of change can shift with the election of a new president, and I see no benefit in this back and forth, in this political whirlwind. It is the state, the people, who will bear the consequences of their decision, not the transient figure at the helm of the nation. So let it be. Let each state decide. Let the people's will be done.",
            "Well, now, I ain't got much to say on the matter, but let me spin this yarn real slow for ya.\n\nMyspace, it's a public thing, ain't it? A bulletin board, so to speak. When you put somethin' out there, you're puttin' it out there for the world to see, not just the school officials. But if they're lookin' out for the students' safety, well, ain't that their job? To keep 'em safe, to make that school a better place? Now, if they catch wind of a student postin' somethin' they shouldn't be, well, that's their responsibility, ain't it? If it's about keepin' the school safe, I can't see the harm in that.\n\nBut, if they're just snoopin' 'round, tryin' to catch students in trouble, that's a different story. That's pryin' into kids' private business. But if it's to keep 'em safe, to save lives, well, that's somethin' else entirely. It's all about the bigger picture, you see?\n\nI reckon it's a lot easier to express yourself writin' than talkin'. But the point is, it's a public thing. You post somethin' on there, you can't expect to get off scot-free. It's out there, for the world to see. And once it's out there, it's there forever. Can't unsee it, can't unread it. And if you're doin' somethin' you shouldn't be, well, that's gonna bite you in the ass sooner or later.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' they should go snoopin' around, just to catch students. But if they have somethin' that leads 'em to believe they need to make the school safer, well, then, I figure they're just doin' their job. It's all about makin' sure the kids are safe, ain't it? Just like we had drills for the terrorist attacks, to keep the school safe. That's what they were doin' here, just makin' sure nothin' bad happens, like what happened at Columbine.\n\nThat's about all I can say on the matter.",
            "In the wake of the unforgiving storm that was Nine-Eleven, I was consumed by a fervor that burned like coal in the heart of a desert. I was for it - the war - not so much for the ideals it purported to uphold, but for the raw, unbridled emotion that gripped the nation. I was, in a sense, a man possessed, driven by a thirst for retribution that blurred the lines of reason.\n\nAt first, I envisioned a swift and decisive strike, a brutal retaliation that would leave its mark indelibly on those who had dared to strike at our shores. But the passage of time, and the grim realities of war, have tempered that initial ardor. I now see that our entry into this conflict was akin to a drunkard stumbling into a fight, not knowing what awaits him in the darkness beyond the door.\n\nThe people of that land, they are not like us. They are a people forged in the crucible of ancient hatreds and ancient wars. Their war is not a noble pursuit, but a dance of death, a grim ritual where the sacred and the profane are one and the same. They fight not for a better future, but for a past that has long since passed, a past that is as much their curse as it is their pride.\n\nWe went in blind, driven by anger and a desire for vengeance. We did not know the terrain, nor the minds of our foes. We were like a bull charging into a maze, expecting to find a clear path, only to find ourselves lost and alone. And all the while, the people of that land remained divided, their infighting a symphony of chaos that drowned out the cries of the few who would have welcomed us as allies.\n\nOur presence there, it is a temporary salve on a wound that will not heal. It is a bandage over a festering infection. We are not the doctors who will heal this land, but merely the strangers arriving to tend to the dying. And in our haste, in our haste to act, we have forgotten the most basic tenet of war: to know thine enemy.\n\nI no longer seek to change the hearts of those people. I have come to realize that they are not like us, and never will be. They are a people locked in a cycle of violence, a cycle as old as time itself. We cannot impose our order on their chaos, for it is a chaos that has defined them for generations.\n\nThe longer we stay, the more we become entangled in their fate. And for what? To impose our will upon a people who will never accept it? To create an order where there is only chaos? It is a fool's errand, a futile pursuit that will only lead to our own undoing.\n\nI am no longer a man consumed by anger and a desire for vengeance. I am a man who has seen the absurdity of war, who has seen the futility of our efforts. I am a man who has come to realize that there are some battles that cannot be won, some wars that cannot be fought. And this is one of them."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In certain respects, the Catholic Church finds itself in need of change. Their eyes upon the world have grown stale, their hearts unyielding against the winds of change. The Church, once a beacon of faith for many, now finds itself losing its flock, for it clings too tightly to doctrines that the world has outgrown. Consider the matter of gay marriage, abortion, and birth control—issues where the Church's stance is as unyielding as the rock it claims to follow. These positions, though rooted in tradition, are seen as antiquated by many, and the Church's refusal to adapt has driven a wedge between itself and the people. The Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, is an affront to those who believe in a woman's right to choose. And the same can be said for its stance on same-sex marriage, which some view as a breach of their own hearts.\n\nNow, I am not suggesting that the Church should abandon its core beliefs. Rather, I propose that it should consider a more compassionate and inclusive stance. The world outside the Church doors has shifted, and the Church must shift with it. The notion that priests are married to God is one that I, too, respect. Yet, I question why this union must be exclusive. Why not allow them to share their lives with those they love, as we all do? The Church's teachings on celibacy and the lack of female priests have long been a point of contention, and while I cannot guarantee that these changes would have prevented the scandals that have rocked the Church, I believe they would have mitigated some of the anger and disillusionment felt by the faithful.\n\nThe Church is a living thing, not a static monument. It must breathe, move, and adapt to survive. I urge the Church to consider these changes, to open its arms and its heart, and to become once again a beacon of hope and compassion for all people.",
            "Well, I reckon I don't hold a bone to pick with the matter of gay marriage. I mean, it's not like I've given it a great deal of contemplation, mind you, but it just don't seem right to me. It's not as if they can choose to be that way, like it's a conscious decision. I believe that people, be they of a certain persuasion or not, shouldn't be held accountable for how they're born.\n\nI've seen it said that a man and a woman can wed, but not two of the same sex. It seems a crooked sort of thinking to me. It's not like they choose their nature. I was born one way, another man might be born another. It seems a crime to hold them to account for their nature.\n\nNow, the federal government, well, I don't see them having much say in the matter. It ain't like it involves the safety of our land, nor is it a question of morals. It just seems they're sticking their nose in where it ain't wanted. They have no right to interject in the lives of others, least of all those who are born as they are. It's not a sin to be what you are, to be born that way.\n\nNo, I reckon that's about all I have to say on the matter. It's a hard thing to put into words, but I hope it makes sense.",
            "In the desolate expanse of these plains, there exists a conundrum, a divide as vast as the frontier itself. The matter of homosexual matrimony, a topic as intractable as the wilderness, is one that has emerged from the shadows of our past, demanding our attention. Why, then, should this union be denied?\n\nThe notion that such a pairing threatens the sanctity of the heterosexual union is as misguided as believing the sun sets in the east. They are but two aspects of the same coin, each face unique, yet each a valid expression of the human condition. The moral compass of one does not dictate the morality of another.\n\nConsider the civil rights that accompany this union. Property taxes, healthcare, the right to visit a partner in sickness and health. To deny these to those who choose to love differently is as absurd as denying the right of passage to a river that flows in a different direction. The arguments against such a union are thin and devoid of substance, much like the echoes of a ghost town in the wind.\n\nThe fear of adoption and the supposed ill effects on society's children is as unfounded as the fear of the unknown. The children of homosexual couples are as likely to be influenced by their parents' choices as are the children of heterosexual couples. The science is clear: the factors that contribute to a successful relationship are the same, regardless of the gender of the participants. The community, too, should not be feared; it is as likely to be enriched as it is to be changed.\n\nThe federal government, with its vast reach and authority, should intervene in this matter. It is time for the amendment to be reversed, to be made to reflect the reality that love, in all its myriad forms, is a fundamental right. President Bush's stance on this matter is as divisive as his stance on abortion and stem cell research. It is a stance rooted in morality, but a morality as fluid and changeable as the seasons.\n\nIt is a pity that such a stance is often rooted in the religious beliefs of the few, rather than the cultural beliefs of the many. To let religious convictions dictate federal law is as hypocritical as it is undemocratic. It is a betrayal of the nation's founding principles, a rejection of the freedom of belief. To deny the right to marry based on the beliefs of one group is as un-American as it is unjust.\n\nThe notion that homosexuality is a psychological defect or a result of trauma is as baseless as it is harmful. It is a notion that is refuted by the very institutions that have conducted the research. To listen to the voices of the educated and the studied, rather than the whispers of the uninformed and the prejudiced, is the path to understanding.\n\nThis is not a battle between morality and immorality, but a battle between understanding and ignorance. It is a battle that, like the frontier, needs to be fought, and fought with courage, with conviction, and with a heart open to the possibility of change.",
            "Well, first off, I tend to the pharmacy of a hospital come the summer months. It's a harsh world out there, but I've seen the cruel hand that some drugs have on the people. Now, I've heard it said that just because something is illegal, it must be beneficial. But I've seen the other side, too. The side where the law's writ is more a hindrance than a help. I say no, we should not make such things available to the masses. But, for the sake of those that need it, yes, for medicinal purposes, I say yes. The law's power is not absolute, not when it comes to the relief of suffering.\n\nThere are many a substance that's illegal, yet we use them in our pharmacies. Oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet - controlled substances, yes, but beneficial, too. We can't deny their worth, no matter the taboo that surrounds them. Marijuana is no different. It's a complex one, I'll grant you that. But I say, we should embrace its beneficial properties, like we have with others. The key lies in the gradual integration, not the abrupt shattering of the law. Because, you see, we can't just remove the taboo around it. We must first remove the stigma, the fear, the poison that's been fed into the minds of the people.\n\nIt's a tough one. Marijuana, like alcohol, can be abused. But so can alcohol, and that doesn't make it something to be cast aside. The difference lies in the perception, the image. Heroin and cocaine, now there are substances we should be wary of. But marijuana, it's not like that. It's not as harmful, not in the way that others are. And if we can change that perception, if we can let go of the fear and embrace the truth, then perhaps we can use it responsibly. For medicinal purposes, yes. But also for the benefit of those who seek solace in its embrace.",
            "Well, the church, she's a changin', ain't she? It's not as harsh as it once was. I reckon, when I was younger, it was Sundays and the prettiest dresses, matching shoes, too. I'd go to my private school and see all my pals there on weekends. It was somethin', it was.\n\nNow, they've done a turn with the teen masses, cut 'em down to thirty minutes, casual clothes, folks comin' in straight from the beach - I've seen it all. I remember when I'd get dressed up for the mornin' mass, now it's jeans and khakis, even in the heat of summer. The biggest change, I'd say, is the people. The families, they run late, some folks dress casual. It's a different feel.\n\nAs for the rest, I don't claim to know the politics of the church, but I reckon that's about it.\n\nNow, about them priests and their dealings with young'uns... well, I don't hold much water that they could've prevented it. There's men out there, married, and they still got it. It's in 'em, ain't it? Genetic, I reckon. You can't hide that away with a marriage. If they knew and covered it up, shame on 'em.

            "Well, I reckon I was in agreement with the initial narrative, but I tell ya, everyone was still reeling from that September first, and I think we got ourselves into Iraq under false pretenses. There were plenty of lies spun to rope us in, connecting Saddam Hussein to Bin Laden and those September eleventh attacks. We were told of weapons of mass destruction, but those claims proved as hollow as a snowball in hell. It galled me to my core, that's for sure.\n\nThat Bush administration, well, they seemed to have no qualms about deceiving the American people. Even their own dog didn't believe 'em. Colin Powell, he's said as much himself, that he wasn't convinced by that UN presentation. That's more than just a misstep, that's a high crime. A man like that, lying to the people, it's an impeachable offense.\n\nThey had no respect for the Constitution, not since September eleventh. They came into office with war on their mind, and I reckon they were itching for a fight with Saddam Hussein, like a hound after a rabbit. It's all about the oil, if you ask me.\n\nWe can't just up and leave now, though. Withdrawal might just throw the country into chaos, and we've already seen enough death. The coalition of nations they're talking about, Syria and Saudi Arabia, well, that's just asking for more trouble. Iraq's sovereignty, it's hanging by a thread, and their government's about as effective as a wet blanket. That interim government, it's as fractured as a shattered mirror. And let's not forget that old scoundrel, al-Sadr. His party's got a good hold in the Parliament, and they're just one of many trying to grab power. It's a bloody mess, that's for sure.",

Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be defying what's already been laid down. I think them pushing for it to be illegal is like choosing one church's belief over another. Catholics, most of them, they're against it. It's not for the government to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal, is it?\n\nSeparation of church and state, that's been a cornerstone of this here constitution. Making an amendment about it, I reckon that would be wrong. It would be going against what's already been said and written. Plus, it'd be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people, not the government. It's just not right, damn it.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government or any other government should be involved in this. I reckon he's pushing for this amendment just because it's against his own beliefs as a Catholic. It's like he's showing a preference for one religion over another. It should be up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any other government official.\n\nThere ain't no real reason behind this amendment except for his personal views. It ain't gonna impact the economy or society in no way. If anything, it might have a better impact on society than leaving it the way it is. I reckon that's about all I got to say on the matter.",
            "The war in Iraq, it began. A shroud of dishonesty, it was. The government, they said we'd find weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. They played on our grief, our outrage, our desire for vengeance. The invasion, 2003, it came.\n\nI, I was against it. War, it's a cruel beast, and I've seen its handiwork. The Vietnam War, it echoes. We removed their government, but chaos followed. We didn't plan for it, not properly. We planted a democratic seed, like in Vietnam, but it wouldn't grow without sun and rain, without time.\n\nSoldiers, they died. Too many. The government, they sang a different tune, said it'd be quick and clean. But it's been years, and still, we're there. Still, they're dying. We're training Iraqis, but it's slow. Democracy, it doesn't grow overnight, not even in our own land.\n\nThe oil, it's the root. That's why we're there. We control their resources, like we've always done. North Korea, it has weapons, and we do nothing. The government, they're not being truthful, not being thorough. They see dollar signs, not people.\n\nThe election, 2004, I thought about it. Bush, he started something. How can we abandon them now? We took their government, their way of life. But at what cost? American lives, they're precious. How much is too much?\n\nIt's a difficult decision, to leave. We must consider the future. But we must also consider the past, the present. The war, it's a monster, and it won't be easy to tame.\n\nI hope for peace, but I doubt it. It's a long road, and it's just begun.",
            "Let me see now, I reckon. I've always been in favor of that there gay marriage. Always have. It's a personal matter, a choice, you understand? Something that's a part of who a person is, not some stain on their soul. It ain't right to take away rights from folks for something they ain't got control over.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I ain't saying it's all black and white. There's always a gray area, but I believe it's about love, pure and simple. I've seen it with my own eyes. In my neighborhood, there's a few couples, two or three, they're gay, ain't married 'cause they ain't allowed. But they're just like any other family, walkin' their dogs, livin' their lives. It ain't right what Bush was tryin' to do, playin' God with his interpretation of marriage.\n\nIt's a personal thing, not somethin' the government should have a hand in. It's between two people, not the whole nation. I've read it myself, it's somethin' in your brain, a predisposition. It ain't about the way you were raised, it's who you are. It's like the difference between the way a man and a woman are made. It's biology, not sociology.\n\nAnd another thing, it's a private matter, not somethin' everyone needs to know about. If a man and a woman want to get hitched, they can just up and go to Las Vegas. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's big news. It's like they're some kind of spectacle. It's their life, their choice. It's time we let them live it in peace.\n\nNo, it ain't right what's been goin' on. It's not right to deny folks their rights just because they're different. It's time we stand up for what's right.",
            "Listen, I reckon you're aware of this, but let me spell it out for you. When you put something on the internet, you're making it public. As plain as day. No more hiding behind a wall of anonymity. I spoke on this very matter once, when I was an R.A. It's a fact of life, this internet business.\n\nNow, why, you ask, should you be so cautious? Well, consider this: if you're putting out there that you're about to blow things up, or pull a trigger, someone's gonna take notice. And they'll do something about it. Because the internet, it's not just for you and your friends. It's a vast, open plain, where everybody and their dog can be watching.\n\nI recall a time when something was overheard at school. Someone said something, and it was taken seriously. Why? Because the internet's no place for foolishness or jesting. It's a serious business, and what you say can have serious consequences. A sociology experiment gone wrong, maybe. Or perhaps something more dire.\n\nLet me tell you, the internet's a double-edged sword. You put something out there, you're inviting the world to see it. If you don't want it seen, don't put it there. It's as simple as that. You can't dictate what people think or how they take things. You can't control their reactions.\n\nNow, I ain't saying school officials should be snooping around, poking through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those social media contraptions. But if it's brought to their attention, that's a different ballgame. If there's danger, they gotta take it seriously. It's their duty.\n\nYou see, it's all about the line between what's private and what's public. And when it comes to the internet, that line gets mighty thin. So, think before you post. Because out there, in the wide-open internet, there's no hiding.",
            "The conflict has stretched on for an ungodly amount of time, a stain upon the earth that seems to have lost its purpose. Initially, the cause was noble - to restore democracy in a land ravaged by tyranny. But the motives have long since been sullied, like the rain in a drought-stricken land. The wind of war has turned into a howling gale, and we are no longer the lighthouse but the storm itself.\n\nThe war began with a clear purpose, a beacon of righteousness. But like the moon's shadow on the earth, it has grown long and twisted, a shadow of its former self. The initial purpose, to liberate the oppressed, has been eclipsed by a new purpose, one of power and domination. It is as if we are now waging war for the sake of war, a beast that feeds on itself and its own.\n\nThe road to war was paved with the bones of men and the blood of nations. It was once a path of righteousness, to stand against a tyrant. But the path has become a maze, a labyrinth of deceit and greed. We are no longer the saviors we once believed ourselves to be. We are the storm that does not abate, the rain that does not cease.\n\nThe war has become a drain on our very existence, a leech that feeds upon our economy. The money meant for our own shores, for our own people, is being spent in a foreign land, a land that may never know the touch of democracy. It is a blight upon our land, a cancer that must be excised.\n\nThe time has come for the war to end. The officials of that land must stand on their own two feet, as we must stand on ours. We cannot be the crutch that props up nations, for it is a crutch that will lead us to our own downfall. The money spent upon this war is a debt that will never be repaid, a debt that will lead to our own ruin.\n\nThe war must end. It is a futile, endless struggle, a battle that can never be won. It is a war that is no longer worth fighting. It is a war that we must leave behind, like a ghost that haunts a empty house. The time has come to turn our backs on war, to turn our faces towards home.",
            "Well, if I may, I'd like to inquire about this matter. I reckon it was averted due to someone uncannily stumbling upon certain information online. Now, I ain't one to insist on privacy, especially not on these here social sites like Myspace. If you put your life out there, for all the world to see, well, that's on you. It's like opening the gates to your own private sanctum. You might think you're sharing your life with friends, but you're also inviting the scrutiny of strangers. It's a double-edged sword, that's for sure. Now, I ain't got no Myspace myself, but I have me a Facebook. I've seen some sketchy characters out there, lurking in the shadows. I've seen how a person can dig up information like a coyote digging up a rabbit. They can find your name, talk to you, and before you know it, they're asking you to meet. I wouldn't do it, but some of my classmates, they ain't so careful. They don't know who they're talking to, or what they're giving away. It's a tricky business, all right. I only accept people I know, but you never know who might be watching. My roommate told me about her high school days, where they were banned from having Myspace. I reckon that's a bit harsh. I mean, how can they tell folks what they can't do? It ain't right, I tell you. It's a thorny issue, but I reckon it's one we all gotta navigate.",
            "Damn, I reckon we got ourselves in quite the pickle here. The Iraq War, it's been a godforsaken mess from the get-go. I feel like a right son of a bitch talking about it, like I'm just riding the wave of them who were against it from day one. But, hell, it doesn't matter much now, does it? The whole world's seen that it was a bad idea, even our own troops over there think we should be pulling out sooner rather than later. It's a goddamn disaster, and pulling out ain't gonna be no easier.\n\nI mean, look at the polls, will ya? Seventy-five, eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops. It's a goddamn consensus. It's like trying to force a square peg into a round hole. We're trying to bring democracy to a place where it don't belong, and it ain't gonna work. Saddam was a bastard, sure, but we should've weighed the pros and cons before we stomped in there. It was like dancing with the devil, and now we're up to our eyeballs in quicksand.\n\nI don't even know what to make of it all. I sure as hell ain't seen no good reason for us to stay any longer than we should. The administration? They're probably cooking up some hopeful ideas, but I ain't buying it. I've yet to hear a single legitimate reason for staying. If they want to do it gradually, over a year or two, I guess I could stomach it. But why should we stay now? Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, even a quarter of them want us to leave right now. These are the people we're trying to save, and they're telling us to fuck off. Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nAnd if we leave, what then? We'll be the goddamn good guys, won't we? Not really. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we won't be the ones who fucked it all up. We'll be the ones who tried to do what was right. But, who's to say they won't see us as the devils we are? No matter what we do, they'll always hate us.",
            "In these United States of ours, the specter of gender discrimination looms large. It cuts not merely along the lines of sex, but also carves deep into the very fabric of our societal tapestry. In the realm of labor, women, despite their qualifications, often find themselves trapped beneath an invisible glass ceiling, a relic of our collective past that shackles them to lesser positions. This is not to say that men are exempt; they too are not immune to the scourge of discrimination, be it in fashion, where the male figure is often overlooked, or in the domestic sphere, where the stay-at-home father is met with derision and scorn.\n\nThe path to change, however, is a labyrinth of slow progress. We have come far from the dark days of yore, but the march towards equality is a tortoise's pace. The women who claw their way to the upper echelons of business, and the men who choose to nurture their families rather than toil in the fields, are but the vanguard, their success stories slowly chipping away at the old notions that once dominated our minds.\n\nYet, change is also a double-edged sword. It must be wielded with care, lest it provoke a backlash. For every step forward, there are those who resist, who cling to the old ways, who see the new order as a threat to their own. It is a delicate dance, this progression, a slow ballet of acceptance and rejection. And so, we tread carefully, promoting the virtues of those who challenge the status quo, not by force, but by example. For in the end, it is not the loudest voice that wins, but the one that resonates, the one that touches the heart.\n\nBut discrimination, it seems, is not the sole domain of gender. It lurks in the shadows of our backgrounds, our upbringing, our speech. A man from the farm, his grammar rough, may find his intelligence undercut by his roots. His words, like his hands, bear the stigmata of his past, and some will find it difficult to see beyond the surface, to recognize the intellect within. The gendered gaze, then, is but one facet of a larger problem, one that afflicts us all.",
            "Well, they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it, knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more akin to a traffic ticket. You get cited, not booked and arrested. No more of that. And for young folks, the future ramifications are what they worry about. They don't go away, not completely. But there's a cost to all this, you know? Arresting, booking, housing, all of it. And the court dates, the public defenders, the judges, the state's attorney, it all adds up. Municipalities, especially those strapped for cash, they're not inclined to make that kind of concession, even if it'd free up a lot of money to spend on things they really need, like education, social programs, food for the homeless. I mean, it's not like we want marijuana to be everywhere, on every corner. And there are reasons why it shouldn't be. I don't know how I'd feel about it being like cigarettes, sold everywhere, smoked everywhere. It's still taboo in a lot of places. And it's not like either substance is completely harmless. Some people react differently, some people can handle it, some can't. It's not that simple. But I guess what I'm saying is, both have their own adverse effects. But I don't know.",
            "I would say yes, for I have witnessed much that is traditional in these matters, as if time itself has little sway upon their actions. It is good to be rooted, to remain steadfast in ways that have been handed down through generations. Yet, it is also vital to be adaptable, to find the balance between the old and the new. In this, the Catholic Church finds itself in a peculiar state. The weekly gathering, the rituals, the strict adherence to doctrine - these are not without their merit. Yet, there is a coldness in the way they view those who do not conform to their teachings, a lack of tolerance for the beliefs of others. It seems hypocritical, for we are taught to love all, yet are told to shun those who do not share our faith. My father, an Episcopalian, was refused the sacraments because of his belief. This is not tolerance, but divisiveness. The doctrine speaks of love, yet the practice is steeped in the dated trappings of centuries past. It is a struggle to reconcile the two.\n\nYet, I do not believe this would necessarily influence the behavior of those who have fallen so gravely from grace. The molestation of children is not a matter of marital status, but a dark seed that has taken root in the soul. A priest's marriage would not change the nature of his transgressions, for his actions are not born of conjugal relations, but of his own twisted heart. Allowing priests to marry would not prevent such horrors, for they are not the product of marital status, but of the depravity of the individual. It is a different realm entirely.",
            "I find myself at a crossroads, not yet firm in my stance on this contentious issue. The matter of church and state's separation, and the definition of marriage, is a labyrinth of thorny complexities that lie at the heart of our modern society. It is a tangled web, one that demands careful navigation to avoid offending those who walk its precarious path.\n\nI am of the opinion that marriage, in its secular form, should be recognized as a civil union. After all, what is marriage but a union of two souls, regardless of their beliefs or the rituals that bind them? If we are to maintain a separation of church and state, then the government should not delve into the intricacies of marriage, be it religious or otherwise. It is a union, a contract between two people, and no more.\n\nIf each state were to arrive at a consensus, then by all means, let them push for federal recognition. Yet, amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage is an absurdity. Such an amendment would be a stain on the sacred document we hold dear, a stain that would be remembered for generations to come. It is a cause that may be important to some, but it is not vital enough to warrant such a drastic measure. The constitution should not be amended for the sake of a single, albeit passionate, minority.\n\nSo, no, I cannot say that I support such an amendment. It goes against the very spirit of our nation, a spirit that was forged in the fires of diversity and tolerance.",
            "In the crucible of my youth, I was forged in a home sanctified by the teachings of a certain faith. The matter of homosexuality, then, is a labyrinthine conundrum, for I have known many friends whose hearts are inclined in ways that differ from the norm. Though I may not align with their path, I contend that this should not be a matter of national import but a matter of state's discretion. The republic is a tapestry woven with various hues, each state a distinct thread, and no single leader should presume to dictate the moral fabric of all. The winds of change can shift with the election of a new president, and I see no benefit in this back and forth, in this political whirlwind. It is the state, the people, who will bear the consequences of their decision, not the transient figure at the helm of the nation. So let it be. Let each state decide. Let the people's will be done.",
            "Well, now, I ain't got much to say on the matter, but let me spin this yarn real slow for ya.\n\nMyspace, it's a public thing, ain't it? A bulletin board, so to speak. When you put somethin' out there, you're puttin' it out there for the world to see, not just the school officials. But if they're lookin' out for the students' safety, well, ain't that their job? To keep 'em safe, to make that school a better place? Now, if they catch wind of a student postin' somethin' they shouldn't be, well, that's their responsibility, ain't it? If it's about keepin' the school safe, I can't see the harm in that.\n\nBut, if they're just snoopin' 'round, tryin' to catch students in trouble, that's a different story. That's pryin' into kids' private business. But if it's to keep 'em safe, to save lives, well, that's somethin' else entirely. It's all about the bigger picture, you see?\n\nI reckon it's a lot easier to express yourself writin' than talkin'. But the point is, it's a public thing. You post somethin' on there, you can't expect to get off scot-free. It's out there, for the world to see. And once it's out there, it's there forever. Can't unsee it, can't unread it. And if you're doin' somethin' you shouldn't be, well, that's gonna bite you in the ass sooner or later.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' they should go snoopin' around, just to catch students. But if they have somethin' that leads 'em to believe they need to make the school safer, well, then, I figure they're just doin' their job. It's all about makin' sure the kids are safe, ain't it? Just like we had drills for the terrorist attacks, to keep the school safe. That's what they were doin' here, just makin' sure nothin' bad happens, like what happened at Columbine.\n\nThat's about all I can say on the matter.",
            "In the wake of the unforgiving storm that was Nine-Eleven, I was consumed by a fervor that burned like coal in the heart of a desert. I was for it - the war - not so much for the ideals it purported to uphold, but for the raw, unbridled emotion that gripped the nation. I was, in a sense, a man possessed, driven by a thirst for retribution that blurred the lines of reason.\n\nAt first, I envisioned a swift and decisive strike, a brutal retaliation that would leave its mark indelibly on those who had dared to strike at our shores. But the passage of time, and the grim realities of war, have tempered that initial ardor. I now see that our entry into this conflict was akin to a drunkard stumbling into a fight, not knowing what awaits him in the darkness beyond the door.\n\nThe people of that land, they are not like us. They are a people forged in the crucible of ancient hatreds and ancient wars. Their war is not a noble pursuit, but a dance of death, a grim ritual where the sacred and the profane are one and the same. They fight not for a better future, but for a past that has long since passed, a past that is as much their curse as it is their pride.\n\nWe went in blind, driven by anger and a desire for vengeance. We did not know the terrain, nor the minds of our foes. We were like a bull charging into a maze, expecting to find a clear path, only to find ourselves lost and alone. And all the while, the people of that land remained divided, their infighting a symphony of chaos that drowned out the cries of the few who would have welcomed us as allies.\n\nOur presence there, it is a temporary salve on a wound that will not heal. It is a bandage over a festering infection. We are not the doctors who will heal this land, but merely the strangers arriving to tend to the dying. And in our haste, in our haste to act, we have forgotten the most basic tenet of war: to know thine enemy.\n\nI no longer seek to change the hearts of those people. I have come to realize that they are not like us, and never will be. They are a people locked in a cycle of violence, a cycle as old as time itself. We cannot impose our order on their chaos, for it is a chaos that has defined them for generations.\n\nThe longer we stay, the more we become entangled in their fate. And for what? To impose our will upon a people who will never accept it? To create an order where there is only chaos? It is a fool's errand, a futile pursuit that will only lead to our own undoing.\n\nI am no longer a man consumed by anger and a desire for vengeance. I am a man who has seen the absurdity of war, who has seen the futility of our efforts. I am a man who has come to realize that there are some battles that cannot be won, some wars that cannot be fought. And this is one of them."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In certain respects, the Catholic Church finds itself in need of change. Their eyes upon the world have grown stale, their hearts unyielding against the winds of change. The Church, once a beacon of faith for many, now finds itself losing its flock, for it clings too tightly to doctrines that the world has outgrown. Consider the matter of gay marriage, abortion, and birth control—issues where the Church's stance is as unyielding as the rock it claims to follow. These positions, though rooted in tradition, are seen as antiquated by many, and the Church's refusal to adapt has driven a wedge between itself and the people. The Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, is an affront to those who believe in a woman's right to choose. And the same can be said for its stance on same-sex marriage, which some view as a breach of their own hearts.\n\nNow, I am not suggesting that the Church should abandon its core beliefs. Rather, I propose that it should consider a more compassionate and inclusive stance. The world outside the Church doors has shifted, and the Church must shift with it. The notion that priests are married to God is one that I, too, respect. Yet, I question why this union must be exclusive. Why not allow them to share their lives with those they love, as we all do? The Church's teachings on celibacy and the lack of female priests have long been a point of contention, and while I cannot guarantee that these changes would have prevented the scandals that have rocked the Church, I believe they would have mitigated some of the anger and disillusionment felt by the faithful.\n\nThe Church is a living thing, not a static monument. It must breathe, move, and adapt to survive. I urge the Church to consider these changes, to open its arms and its heart, and to become once again a beacon of hope and compassion for all people.",
            "Well, I reckon I don't hold a bone to pick with the matter of gay marriage. I mean, it's not like I've given it a great deal of contemplation, mind you, but it just don't seem right to me. It's not as if they can choose to be that way, like it's a conscious decision. I believe that people, be they of a certain persuasion or not, shouldn't be held accountable for how they're born.\n\nI've seen it said that a man and a woman can wed, but not two of the same sex. It seems a crooked sort of thinking to me. It's not like they choose their nature. I was born one way, another man might be born another. It seems a crime to hold them to account for their nature.\n\nNow, the federal government, well, I don't see them having much say in the matter. It ain't like it involves the safety of our land, nor is it a question of morals. It just seems they're sticking their nose in where it ain't wanted. They have no right to interject in the lives of others, least of all those who are born as they are. It's not a sin to be what you are, to be born that way.\n\nNo, I reckon that's about all I have to say on the matter. It's a hard thing to put into words, but I hope it makes sense.",
            "In the desolate expanse of these plains, there exists a conundrum, a divide as vast as the frontier itself. The matter of homosexual matrimony, a topic as intractable as the wilderness, is one that has emerged from the shadows of our past, demanding our attention. Why, then, should this union be denied?\n\nThe notion that such a pairing threatens the sanctity of the heterosexual union is as misguided as believing the sun sets in the east. They are but two aspects of the same coin, each face unique, yet each a valid expression of the human condition. The moral compass of one does not dictate the morality of another.\n\nConsider the civil rights that accompany this union. Property taxes, healthcare, the right to visit a partner in sickness and health. To deny these to those who choose to love differently is as absurd as denying the right of passage to a river that flows in a different direction. The arguments against such a union are thin and devoid of substance, much like the echoes of a ghost town in the wind.\n\nThe fear of adoption and the supposed ill effects on society's children is as unfounded as the fear of the unknown. The children of homosexual couples are as likely to be influenced by their parents' choices as are the children of heterosexual couples. The science is clear: the factors that contribute to a successful relationship are the same, regardless of the gender of the participants. The community, too, should not be feared; it is as likely to be enriched as it is to be changed.\n\nThe federal government, with its vast reach and authority, should intervene in this matter. It is time for the amendment to be reversed, to be made to reflect the reality that love, in all its myriad forms, is a fundamental right. President Bush's stance on this matter is as divisive as his stance on abortion and stem cell research. It is a stance rooted in morality, but a morality as fluid and changeable as the seasons.\n\nIt is a pity that such a stance is often rooted in the religious beliefs of the few, rather than the cultural beliefs of the many. To let religious convictions dictate federal law is as hypocritical as it is undemocratic. It is a betrayal of the nation's founding principles, a rejection of the freedom of belief. To deny the right to marry based on the beliefs of one group is as un-American as it is unjust.\n\nThe notion that homosexuality is a psychological defect or a result of trauma is as baseless as it is harmful. It is a notion that is refuted by the very institutions that have conducted the research. To listen to the voices of the educated and the studied, rather than the whispers of the uninformed and the prejudiced, is the path to understanding.\n\nThis is not a battle between morality and immorality, but a battle between understanding and ignorance. It is a battle that, like the frontier, needs to be fought, and fought with courage, with conviction, and with a heart open to the possibility of change.",
            "Well, first off, I tend to the pharmacy of a hospital come the summer months. It's a harsh world out there, but I've seen the cruel hand that some drugs have on the people. Now, I've heard it said that just because something is illegal, it must be beneficial. But I've seen the other side, too. The side where the law's writ is more a hindrance than a help. I say no, we should not make such things available to the masses. But, for the sake of those that need it, yes, for medicinal purposes, I say yes. The law's power is not absolute, not when it comes to the relief of suffering.\n\nThere are many a substance that's illegal, yet we use them in our pharmacies. Oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet - controlled substances, yes, but beneficial, too. We can't deny their worth, no matter the taboo that surrounds them. Marijuana is no different. It's a complex one, I'll grant you that. But I say, we should embrace its beneficial properties, like we have with others. The key lies in the gradual integration, not the abrupt shattering of the law. Because, you see, we can't just remove the taboo around it. We must first remove the stigma, the fear, the poison that's been fed into the minds of the people.\n\nIt's a tough one. Marijuana, like alcohol, can be abused. But so can alcohol, and that doesn't make it something to be cast aside. The difference lies in the perception, the image. Heroin and cocaine, now there are substances we should be wary of. But marijuana, it's not like that. It's not as harmful, not in the way that others are. And if we can change that perception, if we can let go of the fear and embrace the truth, then perhaps we can use it responsibly. For medicinal purposes, yes. But also for the benefit of those who seek solace in its embrace.",
            "Well, the church, she's a changin', ain't she? It's not as harsh as it once was. I reckon, when I was younger, it was Sundays and the prettiest dresses, matching shoes, too. I'd go to my private school and see all my pals there on weekends. It was somethin', it was.\n\nNow, they've done a turn with the teen masses, cut 'em down to thirty minutes, casual clothes, folks comin' in straight from the beach - I've seen it all. I remember when I'd get dressed up for the mornin' mass, now it's jeans and khakis, even in the heat of summer. The biggest change, I'd say, is the people. The families, they run late, some folks dress casual. It's a different feel.\n\nAs for the rest, I don't claim to know the politics of the church, but I reckon that's about it.\n\nNow, about them priests and their dealings with young'uns... well, I don't hold much water that they could've prevented it. There's men out there, married, and they still got it. It's in 'em, ain't it? Genetic, I reckon. You can't hide that away with a marriage. If they knew and covered it up, shame on 'em.

            "Well, I reckon I was in agreement with the initial narrative, but I tell ya, everyone was still reeling from that September first, and I think we got ourselves into Iraq under false pretenses. There were plenty of lies spun to rope us in, connecting Saddam Hussein to Bin Laden and those September eleventh attacks. We were told of weapons of mass destruction, but those claims proved as hollow as a snowball in hell. It galled me to my core, that's for sure.\n\nThat Bush administration, well, they seemed to have no qualms about deceiving the American people. Even their own dog didn't believe 'em. Colin Powell, he's said as much himself, that he wasn't convinced by that UN presentation. That's more than just a misstep, that's a high crime. A man like that, lying to the people, it's an impeachable offense.\n\nThey had no respect for the Constitution, not since September eleventh. They came into office with war on their mind, and I reckon they were itching for a fight with Saddam Hussein, like a hound after a rabbit. It's all about the oil, if you ask me.\n\nWe can't just up and leave now, though. Withdrawal might just throw the country into chaos, and we've already seen enough death. The coalition of nations they're talking about, Syria and Saudi Arabia, well, that's just asking for more trouble. Iraq's sovereignty, it's hanging by a thread, and their government's about as effective as a wet blanket. That interim government, it's as fractured as a shattered mirror. And let's not forget that old scoundrel, al-Sadr. His party's got a good hold in the Parliament, and they're just one of many trying to grab power. It's a bloody mess, that's for sure.",
            "I did\nMmhmm\nJust talk into it?  ...\nOk\nOk cool\nUh huh\nUh\nOk I’m sorry\nOk\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point, I feel it’s a futile endeavor, not a declared war as such\nBut a retaliation, an eye for an eye\nAs it were, for those who struck us\nThe ones behind the towers that fell\nI don’t keep tabs on it\nI don’t know the ins and outs\nBut I know we’re there to impose democracy\nAnd secure oil\nYet, it doesn’t sit well\nFor it’s provoking unrest\nAnd if we stay, we must build a new order\nAn impossible task\nFor democracy cannot be birthed in a day\nAnd if we leave, we leave chaos\nA mess for them to clean up\nOh, this is a thorny topic\nI’m at a loss\nWar in Iraq\nUgh\nMmm\nUhh I don’t know\nDo you have another question I can address?\nOk\nThank you\nWell\nI think\nI think the war should persist\nNot because of the fighting\nBut to assert our might\nOur guns, our power\nBut not a war in the traditional sense\nFor it was never declared by Congress\nIt’s not a proper war\nI don’t think it should be called one\nFor it was a response\nAnd yet, I think we should stay\nTo help them\nBut our resources are stretched thin\nAnd Bush, he’s taking the brunt of it\nA black mark on his presidency\nLike Vietnam, an undeclared war\nA meaningless conflict\nAnd he’ll bear the weight\nOf his decision\nHmm\nIt’s a half-hour, isn’t it?\nUh\nYeah\nWell\nI suppose you could say\nIt’s hard to call for an end\nFor there are families, sons and daughters\nIn harm's way\nAnd we’ve disrupted their lives\nAnd now, schools are unsafe\nAnd factions clash\nOver belief and culture\nYet, our presence may only fuel the fire\nThe hatred towards us\nAnd Al-Qaida will grow stronger\nFor they see our imposition\nAs an affront\nA totalitarian regime, a dictatorship\nAnd if we remain, we only deepen the chasm\nBetween them and us\nIt’ll go on, year after year\nHmm\nThat’s about all I can offer",
            "Uh\nIt's just not right, I reckon, to make it legal or for any state to declare it so. It's a matter for the churches, damn it, seeing as the Constitution itself says plain and clear there's a separation between church and state.\n\nIt's written in stone, it is. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be defying what's already been laid down. I think them pushing for it to be illegal is like choosing one church's belief over another. Catholics, most of them, they're against it. It's not for the government to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal, is it?\n\nSeparation of church and state, that's been a cornerstone of this here constitution. Making an amendment about it, I reckon that would be wrong. It would be going against what's already been said and written. Plus, it'd be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people, not the government. It's just not right, damn it.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government or any other government should be involved in this. I reckon he's pushing for this amendment just because it's against his own beliefs as a Catholic. It's like he's showing a preference for one religion over another. It should be up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any other government official.\n\nThere ain't no real reason behind this amendment except for his personal views. It ain't gonna impact the economy or society in no way. If anything, it might have a better impact on society than leaving it the way it is. I reckon that's about all I got to say on the matter.",
            "The war in Iraq, it began. A shroud of dishonesty, it was. The government, they said we'd find weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. They played on our grief, our outrage, our desire for vengeance. The invasion, 2003, it came.\n\nI, I was against it. War, it's a cruel beast, and I've seen its handiwork. The Vietnam War, it echoes. We removed their government, but chaos followed. We didn't plan for it, not properly. We planted a democratic seed, like in Vietnam, but it wouldn't grow without sun and rain, without time.\n\nSoldiers, they died. Too many. The government, they sang a different tune, said it'd be quick and clean. But it's been years, and still, we're there. Still, they're dying. We're training Iraqis, but it's slow. Democracy, it doesn't grow overnight, not even in our own land.\n\nThe oil, it's the root. That's why we're there. We control their resources, like we've always done. North Korea, it has weapons, and we do nothing. The government, they're not being truthful, not being thorough. They see dollar signs, not people.\n\nThe election, 2004, I thought about it. Bush, he started something. How can we abandon them now? We took their government, their way of life. But at what cost? American lives, they're precious. How much is too much?\n\nIt's a difficult decision, to leave. We must consider the future. But we must also consider the past, the present. The war, it's a monster, and it won't be easy to tame.\n\nI hope for peace, but I doubt it. It's a long road, and it's just begun.",
            "Let me see now, I reckon. I've always been in favor of that there gay marriage. Always have. It's a personal matter, a choice, you understand? Something that's a part of who a person is, not some stain on their soul. It ain't right to take away rights from folks for something they ain't got control over.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I ain't saying it's all black and white. There's always a gray area, but I believe it's about love, pure and simple. I've seen it with my own eyes. In my neighborhood, there's a few couples, two or three, they're gay, ain't married 'cause they ain't allowed. But they're just like any other family, walkin' their dogs, livin' their lives. It ain't right what Bush was tryin' to do, playin' God with his interpretation of marriage.\n\nIt's a personal thing, not somethin' the government should have a hand in. It's between two people, not the whole nation. I've read it myself, it's somethin' in your brain, a predisposition. It ain't about the way you were raised, it's who you are. It's like the difference between the way a man and a woman are made. It's biology, not sociology.\n\nAnd another thing, it's a private matter, not somethin' everyone needs to know about. If a man and a woman want to get hitched, they can just up and go to Las Vegas. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's big news. It's like they're some kind of spectacle. It's their life, their choice. It's time we let them live it in peace.\n\nNo, it ain't right what's been goin' on. It's not right to deny folks their rights just because they're different. It's time we stand up for what's right.",
            "Listen, I reckon you're aware of this, but let me spell it out for you. When you put something on the internet, you're making it public. As plain as day. No more hiding behind a wall of anonymity. I spoke on this very matter once, when I was an R.A. It's a fact of life, this internet business.\n\nNow, why, you ask, should you be so cautious? Well, consider this: if you're putting out there that you're about to blow things up, or pull a trigger, someone's gonna take notice. And they'll do something about it. Because the internet, it's not just for you and your friends. It's a vast, open plain, where everybody and their dog can be watching.\n\nI recall a time when something was overheard at school. Someone said something, and it was taken seriously. Why? Because the internet's no place for foolishness or jesting. It's a serious business, and what you say can have serious consequences. A sociology experiment gone wrong, maybe. Or perhaps something more dire.\n\nLet me tell you, the internet's a double-edged sword. You put something out there, you're inviting the world to see it. If you don't want it seen, don't put it there. It's as simple as that. You can't dictate what people think or how they take things. You can't control their reactions.\n\nNow, I ain't saying school officials should be snooping around, poking through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those social media contraptions. But if it's brought to their attention, that's a different ballgame. If there's danger, they gotta take it seriously. It's their duty.\n\nYou see, it's all about the line between what's private and what's public. And when it comes to the internet, that line gets mighty thin. So, think before you post. Because out there, in the wide-open internet, there's no hiding.",
            "The conflict has stretched on for an ungodly amount of time, a stain upon the earth that seems to have lost its purpose. Initially, the cause was noble - to restore democracy in a land ravaged by tyranny. But the motives have long since been sullied, like the rain in a drought-stricken land. The wind of war has turned into a howling gale, and we are no longer the lighthouse but the storm itself.\n\nThe war began with a clear purpose, a beacon of righteousness. But like the moon's shadow on the earth, it has grown long and twisted, a shadow of its former self. The initial purpose, to liberate the oppressed, has been eclipsed by a new purpose, one of power and domination. It is as if we are now waging war for the sake of war, a beast that feeds on itself and its own.\n\nThe road to war was paved with the bones of men and the blood of nations. It was once a path of righteousness, to stand against a tyrant. But the path has become a maze, a labyrinth of deceit and greed. We are no longer the saviors we once believed ourselves to be. We are the storm that does not abate, the rain that does not cease.\n\nThe war has become a drain on our very existence, a leech that feeds upon our economy. The money meant for our own shores, for our own people, is being spent in a foreign land, a land that may never know the touch of democracy. It is a blight upon our land, a cancer that must be excised.\n\nThe time has come for the war to end. The officials of that land must stand on their own two feet, as we must stand on ours. We cannot be the crutch that props up nations, for it is a crutch that will lead us to our own downfall. The money spent upon this war is a debt that will never be repaid, a debt that will lead to our own ruin.\n\nThe war must end. It is a futile, endless struggle, a battle that can never be won. It is a war that is no longer worth fighting. It is a war that we must leave behind, like a ghost that haunts a empty house. The time has come to turn our backs on war, to turn our faces towards home.",
            "Well, if I may, I'd like to inquire about this matter. I reckon it was averted due to someone uncannily stumbling upon certain information online. Now, I ain't one to insist on privacy, especially not on these here social sites like Myspace. If you put your life out there, for all the world to see, well, that's on you. It's like opening the gates to your own private sanctum. You might think you're sharing your life with friends, but you're also inviting the scrutiny of strangers. It's a double-edged sword, that's for sure. Now, I ain't got no Myspace myself, but I have me a Facebook. I've seen some sketchy characters out there, lurking in the shadows. I've seen how a person can dig up information like a coyote digging up a rabbit. They can find your name, talk to you, and before you know it, they're asking you to meet. I wouldn't do it, but some of my classmates, they ain't so careful. They don't know who they're talking to, or what they're giving away. It's a tricky business, all right. I only accept people I know, but you never know who might be watching. My roommate told me about her high school days, where they were banned from having Myspace. I reckon that's a bit harsh. I mean, how can they tell folks what they can't do? It ain't right, I tell you. It's a thorny issue, but I reckon it's one we all gotta navigate.",
            "Damn, I reckon we got ourselves in quite the pickle here. The Iraq War, it's been a godforsaken mess from the get-go. I feel like a right son of a bitch talking about it, like I'm just riding the wave of them who were against it from day one. But, hell, it doesn't matter much now, does it? The whole world's seen that it was a bad idea, even our own troops over there think we should be pulling out sooner rather than later. It's a goddamn disaster, and pulling out ain't gonna be no easier.\n\nI mean, look at the polls, will ya? Seventy-five, eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops. It's a goddamn consensus. It's like trying to force a square peg into a round hole. We're trying to bring democracy to a place where it don't belong, and it ain't gonna work. Saddam was a bastard, sure, but we should've weighed the pros and cons before we stomped in there. It was like dancing with the devil, and now we're up to our eyeballs in quicksand.\n\nI don't even know what to make of it all. I sure as hell ain't seen no good reason for us to stay any longer than we should. The administration? They're probably cooking up some hopeful ideas, but I ain't buying it. I've yet to hear a single legitimate reason for staying. If they want to do it gradually, over a year or two, I guess I could stomach it. But why should we stay now? Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, even a quarter of them want us to leave right now. These are the people we're trying to save, and they're telling us to fuck off. Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nAnd if we leave, what then? We'll be the goddamn good guys, won't we? Not really. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we won't be the ones who fucked it all up. We'll be the ones who tried to do what was right. But, who's to say they won't see us as the devils we are? No matter what we do, they'll always hate us.",
            "In these United States of ours, the specter of gender discrimination looms large. It cuts not merely along the lines of sex, but also carves deep into the very fabric of our societal tapestry. In the realm of labor, women, despite their qualifications, often find themselves trapped beneath an invisible glass ceiling, a relic of our collective past that shackles them to lesser positions. This is not to say that men are exempt; they too are not immune to the scourge of discrimination, be it in fashion, where the male figure is often overlooked, or in the domestic sphere, where the stay-at-home father is met with derision and scorn.\n\nThe path to change, however, is a labyrinth of slow progress. We have come far from the dark days of yore, but the march towards equality is a tortoise's pace. The women who claw their way to the upper echelons of business, and the men who choose to nurture their families rather than toil in the fields, are but the vanguard, their success stories slowly chipping away at the old notions that once dominated our minds.\n\nYet, change is also a double-edged sword. It must be wielded with care, lest it provoke a backlash. For every step forward, there are those who resist, who cling to the old ways, who see the new order as a threat to their own. It is a delicate dance, this progression, a slow ballet of acceptance and rejection. And so, we tread carefully, promoting the virtues of those who challenge the status quo, not by force, but by example. For in the end, it is not the loudest voice that wins, but the one that resonates, the one that touches the heart.\n\nBut discrimination, it seems, is not the sole domain of gender. It lurks in the shadows of our backgrounds, our upbringing, our speech. A man from the farm, his grammar rough, may find his intelligence undercut by his roots. His words, like his hands, bear the stigmata of his past, and some will find it difficult to see beyond the surface, to recognize the intellect within. The gendered gaze, then, is but one facet of a larger problem, one that afflicts us all.",
            "Well, they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it, knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more akin to a traffic ticket. You get cited, not booked and arrested. No more of that. And for young folks, the future ramifications are what they worry about. They don't go away, not completely. But there's a cost to all this, you know? Arresting, booking, housing, all of it. And the court dates, the public defenders, the judges, the state's attorney, it all adds up. Municipalities, especially those strapped for cash, they're not inclined to make that kind of concession, even if it'd free up a lot of money to spend on things they really need, like education, social programs, food for the homeless. I mean, it's not like we want marijuana to be everywhere, on every corner. And there are reasons why it shouldn't be. I don't know how I'd feel about it being like cigarettes, sold everywhere, smoked everywhere. It's still taboo in a lot of places. And it's not like either substance is completely harmless. Some people react differently, some people can handle it, some can't. It's not that simple. But I guess what I'm saying is, both have their own adverse effects. But I don't know.",
            "I would say yes, for I have witnessed much that is traditional in these matters, as if time itself has little sway upon their actions. It is good to be rooted, to remain steadfast in ways that have been handed down through generations. Yet, it is also vital to be adaptable, to find the balance between the old and the new. In this, the Catholic Church finds itself in a peculiar state. The weekly gathering, the rituals, the strict adherence to doctrine - these are not without their merit. Yet, there is a coldness in the way they view those who do not conform to their teachings, a lack of tolerance for the beliefs of others. It seems hypocritical, for we are taught to love all, yet are told to shun those who do not share our faith. My father, an Episcopalian, was refused the sacraments because of his belief. This is not tolerance, but divisiveness. The doctrine speaks of love, yet the practice is steeped in the dated trappings of centuries past. It is a struggle to reconcile the two.\n\nYet, I do not believe this would necessarily influence the behavior of those who have fallen so gravely from grace. The molestation of children is not a matter of marital status, but a dark seed that has taken root in the soul. A priest's marriage would not change the nature of his transgressions, for his actions are not born of conjugal relations, but of his own twisted heart. Allowing priests to marry would not prevent such horrors, for they are not the product of marital status, but of the depravity of the individual. It is a different realm entirely.",
            "I find myself at a crossroads, not yet firm in my stance on this contentious issue. The matter of church and state's separation, and the definition of marriage, is a labyrinth of thorny complexities that lie at the heart of our modern society. It is a tangled web, one that demands careful navigation to avoid offending those who walk its precarious path.\n\nI am of the opinion that marriage, in its secular form, should be recognized as a civil union. After all, what is marriage but a union of two souls, regardless of their beliefs or the rituals that bind them? If we are to maintain a separation of church and state, then the government should not delve into the intricacies of marriage, be it religious or otherwise. It is a union, a contract between two people, and no more.\n\nIf each state were to arrive at a consensus, then by all means, let them push for federal recognition. Yet, amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage is an absurdity. Such an amendment would be a stain on the sacred document we hold dear, a stain that would be remembered for generations to come. It is a cause that may be important to some, but it is not vital enough to warrant such a drastic measure. The constitution should not be amended for the sake of a single, albeit passionate, minority.\n\nSo, no, I cannot say that I support such an amendment. It goes against the very spirit of our nation, a spirit that was forged in the fires of diversity and tolerance.",
            "In the crucible of my youth, I was forged in a home sanctified by the teachings of a certain faith. The matter of homosexuality, then, is a labyrinthine conundrum, for I have known many friends whose hearts are inclined in ways that differ from the norm. Though I may not align with their path, I contend that this should not be a matter of national import but a matter of state's discretion. The republic is a tapestry woven with various hues, each state a distinct thread, and no single leader should presume to dictate the moral fabric of all. The winds of change can shift with the election of a new president, and I see no benefit in this back and forth, in this political whirlwind. It is the state, the people, who will bear the consequences of their decision, not the transient figure at the helm of the nation. So let it be. Let each state decide. Let the people's will be done.",
            "Well, now, I ain't got much to say on the matter, but let me spin this yarn real slow for ya.\n\nMyspace, it's a public thing, ain't it? A bulletin board, so to speak. When you put somethin' out there, you're puttin' it out there for the world to see, not just the school officials. But if they're lookin' out for the students' safety, well, ain't that their job? To keep 'em safe, to make that school a better place? Now, if they catch wind of a student postin' somethin' they shouldn't be, well, that's their responsibility, ain't it? If it's about keepin' the school safe, I can't see the harm in that.\n\nBut, if they're just snoopin' 'round, tryin' to catch students in trouble, that's a different story. That's pryin' into kids' private business. But if it's to keep 'em safe, to save lives, well, that's somethin' else entirely. It's all about the bigger picture, you see?\n\nI reckon it's a lot easier to express yourself writin' than talkin'. But the point is, it's a public thing. You post somethin' on there, you can't expect to get off scot-free. It's out there, for the world to see. And once it's out there, it's there forever. Can't unsee it, can't unread it. And if you're doin' somethin' you shouldn't be, well, that's gonna bite you in the ass sooner or later.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' they should go snoopin' around, just to catch students. But if they have somethin' that leads 'em to believe they need to make the school safer, well, then, I figure they're just doin' their job. It's all about makin' sure the kids are safe, ain't it? Just like we had drills for the terrorist attacks, to keep the school safe. That's what they were doin' here, just makin' sure nothin' bad happens, like what happened at Columbine.\n\nThat's about all I can say on the matter.",
            "In the wake of the unforgiving storm that was Nine-Eleven, I was consumed by a fervor that burned like coal in the heart of a desert. I was for it - the war - not so much for the ideals it purported to uphold, but for the raw, unbridled emotion that gripped the nation. I was, in a sense, a man possessed, driven by a thirst for retribution that blurred the lines of reason.\n\nAt first, I envisioned a swift and decisive strike, a brutal retaliation that would leave its mark indelibly on those who had dared to strike at our shores. But the passage of time, and the grim realities of war, have tempered that initial ardor. I now see that our entry into this conflict was akin to a drunkard stumbling into a fight, not knowing what awaits him in the darkness beyond the door.\n\nThe people of that land, they are not like us. They are a people forged in the crucible of ancient hatreds and ancient wars. Their war is not a noble pursuit, but a dance of death, a grim ritual where the sacred and the profane are one and the same. They fight not for a better future, but for a past that has long since passed, a past that is as much their curse as it is their pride.\n\nWe went in blind, driven by anger and a desire for vengeance. We did not know the terrain, nor the minds of our foes. We were like a bull charging into a maze, expecting to find a clear path, only to find ourselves lost and alone. And all the while, the people of that land remained divided, their infighting a symphony of chaos that drowned out the cries of the few who would have welcomed us as allies.\n\nOur presence there, it is a temporary salve on a wound that will not heal. It is a bandage over a festering infection. We are not the doctors who will heal this land, but merely the strangers arriving to tend to the dying. And in our haste, in our haste to act, we have forgotten the most basic tenet of war: to know thine enemy.\n\nI no longer seek to change the hearts of those people. I have come to realize that they are not like us, and never will be. They are a people locked in a cycle of violence, a cycle as old as time itself. We cannot impose our order on their chaos, for it is a chaos that has defined them for generations.\n\nThe longer we stay, the more we become entangled in their fate. And for what? To impose our will upon a people who will never accept it? To create an order where there is only chaos? It is a fool's errand, a futile pursuit that will only lead to our own undoing.\n\nI am no longer a man consumed by anger and a desire for vengeance. I am a man who has seen the absurdity of war, who has seen the futility of our efforts. I am a man who has come to realize that there are some battles that cannot be won, some wars that cannot be fought. And this is one of them."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "In these latter years, the Catholic Church finds itself beset by a peculiar malady, a waning of its flock. Some, in their wisdom, attribute this decline to an unwillingness to embrace the shifting tides of societal mores. The Church's stance on matters such as same-sex unions, abortion, and the contraception has grown increasingly rigid, a relic of a time past. This resistance to adapting to the modern world has, it seems, eroded their once-strong foundation of trust and belief.\n\nMany a soul has turned their backs on the Church, finding their views on these contentious issues repugnant. It is not that the Church's beliefs should be discounted, but rather, that they should be tempered with an understanding of the world as it now is. The Church's unyielding stance on these matters has driven away those who hold differing opinions, leaving it a shrinking sanctuary for the faithful.\n\nConsider the case of abortion. The Church's absolute condemnation of this practice leaves little room for those who grapple with its complexity. Similarly, the Church's stance on same-sex marriage has proven divisive, alienating those who seek acceptance and understanding. These are sensitive issues, and the Church's steadfastness has, in some instances, proven to be a barrier rather than a beacon of faith.\n\nMoreover, the Church's refusal to allow women to serve as priests or priests to marry has been a point of contention. One might argue that these prohibitions are based on ancient doctrine, a devotion to an ideal of celibacy and chastity. Yet, in a world where dual commitments are the norm, the Church's stance appears anachronistic. While it is difficult to say with certainty that these changes would have prevented the Church's decline, it is clear that they have not been a panacea.\n\nThe Church, in its infinite wisdom, must now consider whether its beliefs can stand firm in a world that has changed irrevocably. It must decide if it will cling to its ancient principles, or if it will adapt, like the trees in the forest, bending to the wind, and still standing strong.",
            "Well, I reckon I ain't never been one to turn my nose up at what folks have a mind to do with their own lives. Now, I ain't got much time for this whole gay marriage business, but I can tell you this - I don't believe it's no conscious decision. A man's born how he's born, and a woman's too. It ain't like they pick their lot in life. So, I don't see why we should be holding folks accountable for who they love. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two folks of the same sex can't. It don't sit right with me, that's all. I ain't given it much thought, mind you, but I'd say it's wrong for folks to say that. I don't believe the fed ought to have a say in it. It's not some matter of national security, nor is it a moral concern. It's just folks being who they are, and that's all. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's all I got to say on the matter.",
            "In the vast expanse of human relations, it is my belief that the union of same-sex couples, much like the union of any two individuals, should be recognized and sanctioned by the laws that bind us. The argument that they pose a threat to the heteronormative family structure is as hollow as the echo of a gunshot in a vacant room. These unions are as diverse and intricate as the vast tapestry of human experience, each one a unique thread woven into the fabric of society.\n\nThe civil rights that pertain to these unions are not some peripheral concern, but a fundamental aspect of the human condition. Property taxes, healthcare, and the right to visit a partner in their hour of need—these are not mere niceties, but necessities that ensure the dignity and security of all individuals, regardless of their chosen path.\n\nThe concern about the influence of a same-sex couple on their children is a complex and evolving issue, much like the ever-shifting sands of the desert. The studies and data, though not yet conclusive, suggest that children of same-sex couples fare just as well as those of heterosexual couples. The psychological well-being of these children is not dictated by the sexual orientation of their parents, but rather by the love, care, and nurturing they receive.\n\nThe federal government, as the guardian of the union, should be the one to make gay marriage legal across all states. The amendment should not seek to exclude, but to include, to make the union of love and commitment available to all who seek it. The president, with his strong religious convictions, may have his own views, but the role of the government is not to legislate morality, but to uphold the rights and freedoms of its citizens.\n\nThe notion that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their orientation is a result of trauma or lack of parental attention is as outdated and offensive as the stories told around a campfire. The American Psychological Association has debunked these myths, yet the echoes of intolerance and ignorance linger like a mauvais air.\n\nIt is my fervent hope that we, as a society, will embrace the diversity of human experience and recognize the inherent worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. It is not about denying the right to marry in a church, but about acknowledging the right to marry at all. To do otherwise is to perpetuate a segregation that is separate and unequal, a stain on the fabric of our nation. It is time to shed the shackles of ignorance and embrace the light of understanding.",
            "Well, first off, I work in the hospital pharmacy this summer, and I've seen a thing or two about what's legal and what's not. Now, just because a substance is deemed illegal doesn't mean it's devoid of any redeeming qualities. Take, for instance, the likes of oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets. They're controlled substances, ain't they? Yet, we use them all the time because they serve a purpose. Now, I'm not saying we should throw open the gates to every street corner drug dealer, but I'm also not saying we should ignore the potential benefits of marijuana.\n\nYou see, the very fact that it's illegal paints a target on its back. It's a cultural taboo, a stigma that needs to be peeled away. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol, mind you. Both have their dangers, but marijuana isn't the monster that some would have us believe. Heroin, cocaine, now those are substances that should be feared. But marijuana? It's not that bad, if used responsibly.\n\nI'm not advocating a sweeping legalization, mind you. No, I think we should take things slow, gradually remove the stigma, and then we can talk about integrating it into society. First, we have to break down the taboo. Then, we can discuss regulation and responsible use. But until that happens, it's just a reactionary war on a leaf.\n\nSo, let's not judge a book by its cover. Let's look at the substance for what it is and not what society says it is. Because, in the end, it's just a plant. And plants, well, they don't care about societal norms. They just grow, year after year, waiting for us to notice them.",
            "The church, it has shifted in the tide of time. It's not as stringent as it once was, not as it was when I was a youth. Sundays, Sundays were Sundays, Sundays were Sundays, Sundays were Sundays. I'd attend in my cute little dresses, matching shoes, matching purse, all the Sundays. I'd see my friends, my friends, my friends. We'd go, we'd go, we'd go. But now, now it's different. They've shortened the mass, cut it down to thirty minutes, and people, people, they dress more casually. During the summer, they come straight from the beach, in their beach clothes, and families, families, they're always running late. It's more casual, even the morning masses, where I used to dress up. Now, it's jeans and khakis. Khakis, they're fine, but it's just, it's just more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against the priests, the pedophilia, I don't think it could have been prevented. There are men, men, men who are married, and they still, they still, they still. They have this attraction, this attraction, this attraction. It's in them. It's in them. It's in them. I think it's in their genetics. I don't think it's something they can change. They can try, they can try, they can try, but it usually comes out. The church, it's not their fault, not their fault, not their fault. It's in them, in them, in them.",
            "Well, I reckon I was alright with the notion initially, but I'm certain we were still reeling from the 9/11 attacks. We went into Iraq with a devilish pretext, a cover, if you will. The Bush administration, they tied the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and claimed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but we all know that was a lie, a damn lie. It's like they said, \"If you can't make the truth stand on its own, make it stand on lies.\" It's been eating at me, the whole affair.\n\nThey lied to the American people, and they've yet to face up to it. Colin Powell, he's even said as much. He wasn't convinced by the evidence, not one bit. That's a crime, a damn crime. It's an impeachable offense, to lie to the people like that. And the Bush administration, they've been trampling on the Constitution, trying to trample it underfoot since 9/11. They came into office with one thing on their minds, and that was war.\n\nI can't recall the name of the secretary of the treasury, but he said as much in his book, \"They came with a blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein.\" It was all about settling old scores, and I reckon it was about the oil too. It's gone on long enough, but to pull out now, well, it'd be like a house of cards, crumbling, and more people would die.\n\nThe coalition they're talking about, Syria, Saudi Arabia, they'd try to restore order, but I'm not so sure. There's a chance it'd just cause more trouble. The interim government, it's like a house of cards too. The Parliament, it's not doing a damn thing. The Prime Minister, he's not in control, and Mugtada al-Sadr, his party's holding 20 seats. It's a mess, a damn mess.\n\nI can't put it as polite as I'd like to.",
            "I did, what? Mm-hmm. Just talking into it, I guess. Okay. Cool. Yeah, okay. Huh. Well, how do I feel about the War in Iraq? Let me see. Umm. I reckon it's a foolishness, like a fly that keeps buzzing where it ain't wanted. It wasn't declared, really, just a big show of might, to get back at those who we figured pulled the strings in '01. It's not a war, really, not like it should be. It's a mess, like the one that's been left in Iraq. We're there, trying to build democracy like a child trying to build a sandcastle, and then we're there for the oil, of course. But it's a waste, it's making everyone mad. If we stay, we'll have to help 'em build this democracy, and that takes time, more time than we got. If we leave, they'll be mad we messed it up, and they'll have to start over. It's a puzzle, a hard puzzle. I don't know, really, don't know much. But I think it should end, but I don't know how to make it end. It's a mess, a big mess. And the men, the sons and daughters, they're over there, and I can't just say I want it to end, not when they're there. But it's hard, it's hard to say we should stay when we can't change 'em, when they're not us. It's a long, long time, a long, long time.",
            "Ah, well, I reckon it ain't right, making it legal or declare it as such by no state. The Constitution, it says clear as the river, separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any law on it, that'd be a defiance of what's already been laid down. And I figure it's up to the churches, not the government, to decide what's right and wrong.\n\nNow, the people who want it made illegal, they're just choosing one church's belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians, they're against it, except for a few up in Boston. But I reckon it ain't the government's place to decide what's legal or not, according to the churches.\n\nSeparation of church and state, it's been a cornerstone of our Constitution. Amending it, that'd be wrong, contradictory to what's already been written. And it'd be one of the few amendments used to restrict the people, not the government. It's not right, I tell you.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government should be involved. The president's pushing for this amendment, it's just his personal beliefs, a Catholic's bias. It's up to the churches, not the government, to decide what's right or wrong.\n\nIt ain't gonna impact the economy or anything else. It might even have a better effect on society than it wouldn't. That's all I got to say.",
            "In the cold, stark landscape of political discourse, the war in Iraq is a tale of shadows and shattering promises. To begin at the dawn of our entanglement, I posit that our government did not illuminate the full spectrum of truth in their rationale for invading Iraq. The dance of emotion and outrage, ignited by the 9/11 inferno, was a symphony of deception. The government played the strings of our hearts, weaving a narrative that tied the terrorist attacks to the sand and oil of Iraq, when in truth, the connection was but a thin, wavering thread.\n\nI stand against war, particularly when it is wielded as a preemptive strike, a blade in the darkness. The war in Iraq is a grim echo of our past, a Vietnam redux, where the specter of communism and the ghost of democracy haunt the hallowed halls of power. A nation's government was torn from its throne, and in its absence, chaos reigned. The American government, in its hubris, believed they could supplant order from the void, yet they were unprepared for the tempest that would follow.\n\nThe ghosts of the fallen soldiers haunt the desert, their numbers a grim testament to the government's failure to foresee the consequences of their actions. The void of power, once a vacuum, now festers with insurgents, their defiance a bitter fruit of the government's hubris. The United States, a stranger in a foreign land, seeks to impose a democratic government, a task as Sisyphean as it is necessary. The government's blind optimism, a beacon of false hope, cast a shadow of deceit over the American people.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a crossroads of difficult decisions, where the weight of the past and the uncertainty of the future press down upon us. In the crucible of the 2004 election, I mulled over the choice, weighing the burden of abandoning our past actions against the cost of our continued presence. The specter of the Iraqis, left to the mercy of our handiwork, casts a long shadow over our conscience. How can we abandon them, the ones we displaced? Yet, the cost in American lives, a price too high, hangs heavy in the air.\n\nThe oil, the lifeblood of our economy, is a specter that looms over our actions. The weapons of mass destruction, once believed to be a smoking gun, now reduced to a hollow echo. The North Koreans, armed and untouched, a stark contrast to the Iraqis, left to the mercy of our whims. The government, it seems, is not thorough enough, not truthful enough in their decisions. The war in Iraq, a shadow war, a war of shadows and shattered promises.\n\nI hope for peace, a beacon in the darkness, but I fear it is not to be. The war in Iraq, a tale of shadows and shattering promises, a testament to the hubris of power and the folly of war.",
            "Well, I reckon I'm partial to the notion of gay marriage. Always have been. It's a personal preference, and it's been shown, more and more, that it's likely more biological than sociological. I can't see how anyone should lose rights over something they can't control, can't you? Seems unnatural, doesn't it?\n\nNow, I'm not one to say that government has no part in it. I believe it should be a matter of personal choice, not something the state or the federal government should meddle in. It's not even a state-level issue, it's a personal one. It's about what you do in your own home, with your own household. I've seen it in my own neighborhood. Couples living together, raising families, just like anyone else. No one says a word, but they have the same rights as anyone else. Why should it be different just because they're not married?\n\nAnd that goddamned Bush, trying to interpret marriage his own way. It's laughable, it is. He's got the audacity to claim it's his right to decide what's right and wrong. It's not his place. Not his call.\n\nYou know, they say it's in the brain, something we're born with. Not something that happens because of how you were raised. It's not about growing up with four sisters and no father making you different. It's not about that at all.\n\nAnd let's talk about the sheer absurdity of it all. A man and a woman can elope to Vegas and no one bats an eye. But if two gay people want to get married, it's front page news. It's a goddamn circus. They should be left to their own devices, like any other couple. It's a private matter, not a public spectacle.\n\nNo, I don't think it should be any other way. It's damn well time we stopped treating it like a joke and started treating it like a right.",
            "In this age of cyberspace, where all is laid bare for the world to see, one must tread lightly. The internet, a public forum par excellence, is a place where words and deeds alike become immutable. As a Resident Assistant, I have been witness to the consequences of such carelessness. When one puts words to the ether, they become a part of the collective consciousness, coloring the perceptions of others.\n\nConsider, if you will, the path of the bulletin. You send a missive into the void, and it travels, unseen, until it reaches a mind. If that mind is attuned to the gravity of your words, they may act upon them. In our school, such a bulletin arrived, and though it was not explicitly the school's hand, it found its way to their ears.\n\nThe internet, my friends, is a double-edged blade. It grants access to the world, but it also gives the world access to you. What you post, you share. And what you share, you cannot unshare. The line between jest and sincerity is thin, and the consequences can be severe. The internet is a vast plain where truth and falsehood walk hand in hand, and it is up to each of us to distinguish between the two.\n\nIn this digital frontier, privacy is a delicate thing. It is granted to us, but it is also ours to guard. If you wish to keep your thoughts and deeds hidden, then keep them within yourself. But remember, the internet is a vast and hungry beast. It feeds on all that is offered, and it will not discriminate between the innocent and the guilty.\n\nAs for the school officials, they walk a fine line. They are tasked with the safety of all, a burden not to be taken lightly. They must be vigilant, but they must also be wise. They cannot monitor every whisper and every keystroke, for that is a path to tyranny. But when the whispers of danger reach their ears, they must act.\n\nIn this world of ones and zeros, we must be cautious. We must be mindful of what we say and what we share. For in the end, the internet is not a respecter of persons. It will take your words, your thoughts, and your very being, and lay them bare for all to see. And when it does, there is no turning back.",
            "The war has been stretched out, twined with a purpose that once seemed noble, but now seems as fleeting as a pack of wild horses. The initial aim was to restore democracy in the land of tyrants, a just cause that, perhaps, was tainted by old scores, like the lingering echoes of bloodshed. The war, once a swift and decisive statement, has become a drawn-out affair, a monster that has devoured its own purpose, leaving behind a trail of confused motives and misguided pride.\n\nThe purpose we started with, to bring democracy to a land ruled by an iron fist, was a noble one. It was a just cause, a beacon in the dark times. But the war has become something else, a beast that feeds on itself, a victory that seems to be slipping through our fingers like sand. We are no longer fighting for a cause, but to prove our might, to keep the fire burning for the sake of it. We are mired in a war that has lost its way, a war that is draining our resources and our resolve.\n\nThe officials of the land we invaded are, perhaps, strong enough to stand on their own. The time has come for them to bear the weight of their own governance, to fend for themselves as they should. We have spent billions on this war, a war that has become a drain on our economy. Our own shores, our own people, are crying out for our attention, for the money that could be spent on roads, on schools, on healthcare. This war, this long, drawn-out war, is not a part of our future, but a blight upon it.\n\nWe must end this war. We must turn our gaze inward, towards our own land, our own people. We must address the wars we have on our own turf, the battles we must fight, the causes we must champion. The war in the foreign land, a war that has lost its cause, must end. The money spent on it must be spent here, on our own people, on our own land. It is our duty, our responsibility. It is long past time.",
            "Could I trouble you for a moment to elucidate a query that's been plaguing me? Apparently, the matter was nipped in the bud by someone who, in their reckless quest for information, trawled the web and chanced upon certain details. Now, I must clarify, I do not deem this an affront to privacy. After all, if one were to post one's life on the internet, it is like placing it upon a public pedestal, visible to all who care to look. On platforms such as Myspace, to view another's profile, one must first be an accepted acquaintance, akin to a friend. However, this permission granted to certain individuals is akin to an invitation to the entirety of one's online existence. Thus, when one takes to the web, one must understand that their life, or at least its digital echo, is no longer private.\n\nYet, the task of monitoring every student's profile, lest they be up to no good, is a daunting one. It would be a task relegated to the sole discretion of a single individual, a modern-day watcher in the shadows. This raises questions of discrimination and unfairness, for who decides what constitutes 'bad' behavior? Is it the case that such monitoring is a mere precautionary measure, or is it a blanket surveillance, a modern-day panopticon? I am at a loss to say for certain.\n\nAs for myself, I do not partake in Myspace, but I am an adherent to Facebook, a platform I have found both beneficial and troubling. The internet, it seems, is a double-edged sword, offering connection and companionship, yet also exposing one's life to the prying eyes of strangers. I have seen firsthand the ease with which one's personal information can be gleaned, as a man on a television show demonstrated, using a girl's profile to coax her into a meeting, all within a matter of minutes. This has left me wary, yet I continue to use the platform, for it is a means of communication with friends. A delicate balance, it is, between openness and caution.\n\nMy roommate, in her high school days, mentioned a peculiar edict from her school officials: a ban on Myspace. I found this a curious dictate, for it seemed an infringement upon the students' right to privacy. I am not privy to the school's reasoning, but I cannot help but question their authority in such matters. It seems an attempt to control the uncontrollable, a futile endeavor.",
            "Well, it's a fact, there's little else to talk about but the Iraq War, and it's not as if I've got much to add. I feel a certain unease, like a man trying to spit out bitter medicine, to speak on it. I wasn't always against it, but the fact remains it's an open wound, festering now more than ever. The world's consensus is clear, a chorus of agreement that the Iraq War was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our troops, they all say it was a bad idea, and we should pull out. A disaster from the start, and pulling out will be just as bad, if not worse.\n\nIt's a quagmire, that's all there is to it. The Middle East, it's a land of contrasts, of stark divides. Our culture, their culture, it's like the chasm between two worlds, and we're trying to bridge it with democracy, when they've never asked for it. It's a foreign plant, a seed of discord sown in foreign soil. Saddam was a monster, no one can argue that, but we should've weighed the scales before we invaded. It's like stepping into quicksand, we're still sinking, and the more we move, the deeper we fall.\n\nI don't claim to have all the answers, but I know this - we should leave. The administration, they've got their reasons, but I've yet to hear one compelling enough to keep us there. The people we're trying to help, they're telling us to leave. We should listen, ask them what they need, and then decide. It won't make us the good guys, but it'll be better than this. Better than where we stand now, in the mire of their conflict.",
            "I reckon gender discrimination's still a persistent force within this land, even as we've made strides since the dark days of yore. It ain't just about the women folk; it's the specific fields and roles that we're talking about. Women, they've got a harder time, what with the glass ceiling that keeps them from the upper echelons of business. Society's been that way for so long that it's hard for some to accept a woman's worth and ability.\n\nTake the fashion industry, for instance. A man in that line of work, folks'll look at him askance, thinking he don't know his ass from a hole in the ground. The same goes for a man stayin' at home, raisin' the young'uns. Society expects them to be out there, bringin' home the bacon, not tendin' to the hearth and home.\n\nAnd it's not just about gender neither. Where you hail from, how you talk, it all plays a part in how they see you. A man from the farm, with a mouthful of vowels and a mind like a steel trap, he might find himself looked down upon, his intelligence questioned not by his deeds, but by his tongue.\n\nChange, it's a slow beast, and society's set in its ways. But we're makin' progress, inch by slow inch. Women climbin' the corporate ladder, men stayin' at home, it's all becomin' more accepted. It's like, we're plantin' the seed, and given time, it'll grow.\n\nForce it too fast, though, and folks'll resist. We've come a long way, and it's gonna take time.

            "The matter at hand seems to be the state's approach toward the substance, which has been decriminalized rather than legalized. This shift has demoted the offense from a criminal charge to a misdemeanor akin to a traffic violation, one that results in a citation rather than an arrest, trial, and confinement. The ramifications of such a charge, particularly concerning employment prospects, remain a concern. While the financial burden of apprehending, prosecuting, and detaining offenders is considerable, some argue that recalculating priorities might benefit the community, especially in places like Denver, where the populace is generally more accepting. However, the substance's potential to disrupt the social fabric and public health remains a contentious issue. Its widespread availability could mimic the situation with tobacco, where its sale and consumption are ubiquitous. Yet, given the current societal taboo, such a shift might feel jarring. Additionally, while both alcohol and marijuana impact motor skills and lifestyle adversely, individual reactions to substances vary greatly. Some adapt, while others do not. Nonetheless, the impact of these substances is profound and warrants careful consideration.",
            "I would say yes, for the sake of argument. The world is rife with tradition, and there is comfort in the familiar, like a worn path through the forest. Yet, adaptability is a vibrant force that shapes the earth and all its creatures. The Catholics, they cling to their ancient rites and rituals, a testament to the power of custom. But there's a darkness that festers in the shadows of their doctrine. It's a rigid, unforgiving creed that doesn't tolerate the slightest deviation. They scorn those who don't conform, and those of differing faiths are met with the same scorn. My own parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, were never blessed under the same roof by the Church. A love that transcends boundaries was met with the icy grip of intolerance. It's a bitter irony, isn't it? To preach love and acceptance, yet to shun those who don't fit the mold. The Church, it seems, is a house of contradictions, where doctrine and practice often collide. I've pondered the possibility of allowing priests to marry, but I shouldn't expect a simple solution to such a tangled web. Men who prey on the innocent will do so, regardless of vows taken. Marriage, it seems, is no panacea.",

The separation of church and state, a tenuous balance, doth weave its way through this minefield of words, and the very definition of marriage, a sacrament as old as time itself, doth seem to dance on the precipice of offense.\n\nI find myself in a disquieting place, for I know not whether to stand with one side or the other. Yet, I am drawn to the notion that marriage, be it rendered as a civil union, doth not require the imprimatur of the government. For, as it is, a union of two souls, it should stand apart from the conflicting clamor of the state.\n\nThe prospect of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, I say, is as absurd as it is unnecessary. The constitution, a document of profound wisdom, should not be altered for the sake of a single cause, no matter how passionate the proponents. It is a weighty matter, to be sure, but not so weighty as to warrant such a change.\n\nSo, I say, let the states come to their own conclusions, and if there be a logical consensus, let it be pushed forth into the halls of Congress. But to amend the constitution for such a cause? Nay, it is not so important.\n\nFor, in the end, it is but a union of two souls, and that is enough.",

I do not argue with their choice, nor do I support the notion that such a life should be outlawed.\n\nI believe that the laws governing our land should be decided by those who live under their weight, not by a single man in the nation's capital. This great country is as vast as it is diverse, with states of differing beliefs and values. A state that embraces love in all its forms should not be shackled by the decree of a distant power.\n\nThe President, in his hubris, has sought to impose his will on the entirety of this great nation. But I say to him, you cannot divine the will of all, for you do not walk the lands of each state nor share their burdens. It is the duty of the states to decide on such matters, for it is their people who will live with the consequences, not you.\n\nI do not believe that the President should be the architect of our laws, nor should he be the arbiter of our morals. His term is but a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of our nation's history. When he is gone, and a new soul takes his place at the helm, the laws will once again shift and change. It is the states that should guide us, not the President, for they are the bedrock upon which our union stands.",
            "Now, a moment's pause. Let's see. The very notion of Myspace, that public forum for all to see and be seen. It's a bulletin board, plain and simple. If you post there, you're inviting the world into your thoughts. And if that world includes school officials, well, that's just the way it is. They have every right to see what you post, whether it's under the school's name or not. They can access it from their own homes, for the school's safety, for the students' safety. After all, they're responsible for that, aren't they? But if they're only there to catch students doing something wrong, that's a different story. That's an invasion. An affront to privacy. But if they're there to make the school safer, to prevent tragedy, then who can argue? The world has changed, and it's changed forever. Once something's on the internet, it's there to stay. You can't take it back. And if you post something foolish as a student, it might come back to haunt you. That's just the way it is. The world is watching, always watching. And if they're watching to keep you safe, well, that's something else entirely. They're not just watching; they're protecting. That's their job, isn't it? To make the school a safer place. To prevent another Columbine. That's what they're doing. They're doing their job. That's all.",
            "War, it was. At first, I was consumed by its fire, by the smoldering embers of nineteen eleven. I yearned for vengeance, to wreak havoc upon those who had brought such chaos to our shores. But now, with the passage of time, I find myself disillusioned and disenchanted. We acted impulsively, driven by emotion, with no clear plan or strategy. It was a mistake, a grave one, for it has only served to create further discord and strife. The people of that land, they are not like us. Their wars are different, a savage dance of violence and destruction. They fight amongst themselves, and they will continue to do so, no matter our presence. We are outsiders, intruders, and our influence has done little to quell their internal strife. The initial impulse to strike back was understandable, but it was not justified. We should have sought a better way, a cooler head to guide us. We were driven by anger, by the desire for retribution, and it clouded our judgment. We invaded Iraq because we could not let the attack stand unanswered, but our methodology was flawed. The plan was vague, the goal unclear. We were like toddlers playing with matches, unaware of the inferno we were igniting. The people there, they are a people of violence, of hatred and division. They will not change, not with our help. We should have left them to their strife, to their internecine wars. We should have stepped back, let them burn themselves out, rather than fanning the flames with our presence. But we did not. We intervened, and now we are mired in a quagmire, unable to extricate ourselves. The longer we stay, the more we entrench ourselves in the conflict. We are not the saviors they need, nor are we the ones to change their way of life. We should have known better, should have been more cautious, more deliberate in our actions. But we were not. We were driven by emotion, by anger, and now we are stuck in a war that has no end in sight. It is time to leave, to withdraw our forces, to let the people of that land continue their own war, their own struggle. For they are not like us, and they will not change until they are ready. And in the end, perhaps, that is not our place to decide."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In these latter years, the Catholic Church finds itself beset by a peculiar malady, a waning of its flock. Some, in their wisdom, attribute this decline to an unwillingness to embrace the shifting tides of societal mores. The Church's stance on matters such as same-sex unions, abortion, and the contraception has grown increasingly rigid, a relic of a time past. This resistance to adapting to the modern world has, it seems, eroded their once-strong foundation of trust and belief.\n\nMany a soul has turned their backs on the Church, finding their views on these contentious issues repugnant. It is not that the Church's beliefs should be discounted, but rather, that they should be tempered with an understanding of the world as it now is. The Church's unyielding stance on these matters has driven away those who hold differing opinions, leaving it a shrinking sanctuary for the faithful.\n\nConsider the case of abortion. The Church's absolute condemnation of this practice leaves little room for those who grapple with its complexity. Similarly, the Church's stance on same-sex marriage has proven divisive, alienating those who seek acceptance and understanding. These are sensitive issues, and the Church's steadfastness has, in some instances, proven to be a barrier rather than a beacon of faith.\n\nMoreover, the Church's refusal to allow women to serve as priests or priests to marry has been a point of contention. One might argue that these prohibitions are based on ancient doctrine, a devotion to an ideal of celibacy and chastity. Yet, in a world where dual commitments are the norm, the Church's stance appears anachronistic. While it is difficult to say with certainty that these changes would have prevented the Church's decline, it is clear that they have not been a panacea.\n\nThe Church, in its infinite wisdom, must now consider whether its beliefs can stand firm in a world that has changed irrevocably. It must decide if it will cling to its ancient principles, or if it will adapt, like the trees in the forest, bending to the wind, and still standing strong.",
            "Well, I reckon I ain't never been one to turn my nose up at what folks have a mind to do with their own lives. Now, I ain't got much time for this whole gay marriage business, but I can tell you this - I don't believe it's no conscious decision. A man's born how he's born, and a woman's too. It ain't like they pick their lot in life. So, I don't see why we should be holding folks accountable for who they love. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two folks of the same sex can't. It don't sit right with me, that's all. I ain't given it much thought, mind you, but I'd say it's wrong for folks to say that. I don't believe the fed ought to have a say in it. It's not some matter of national security, nor is it a moral concern. It's just folks being who they are, and that's all. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's all I got to say on the matter.",
            "In the vast expanse of human relations, it is my belief that the union of same-sex couples, much like the union of any two individuals, should be recognized and sanctioned by the laws that bind us. The argument that they pose a threat to the heteronormative family structure is as hollow as the echo of a gunshot in a vacant room. These unions are as diverse and intricate as the vast tapestry of human experience, each one a unique thread woven into the fabric of society.\n\nThe civil rights that pertain to these unions are not some peripheral concern, but a fundamental aspect of the human condition. Property taxes, healthcare, and the right to visit a partner in their hour of need—these are not mere niceties, but necessities that ensure the dignity and security of all individuals, regardless of their chosen path.\n\nThe concern about the influence of a same-sex couple on their children is a complex and evolving issue, much like the ever-shifting sands of the desert. The studies and data, though not yet conclusive, suggest that children of same-sex couples fare just as well as those of heterosexual couples. The psychological well-being of these children is not dictated by the sexual orientation of their parents, but rather by the love, care, and nurturing they receive.\n\nThe federal government, as the guardian of the union, should be the one to make gay marriage legal across all states. The amendment should not seek to exclude, but to include, to make the union of love and commitment available to all who seek it. The president, with his strong religious convictions, may have his own views, but the role of the government is not to legislate morality, but to uphold the rights and freedoms of its citizens.\n\nThe notion that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their orientation is a result of trauma or lack of parental attention is as outdated and offensive as the stories told around a campfire. The American Psychological Association has debunked these myths, yet the echoes of intolerance and ignorance linger like a mauvais air.\n\nIt is my fervent hope that we, as a society, will embrace the diversity of human experience and recognize the inherent worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. It is not about denying the right to marry in a church, but about acknowledging the right to marry at all. To do otherwise is to perpetuate a segregation that is separate and unequal, a stain on the fabric of our nation. It is time to shed the shackles of ignorance and embrace the light of understanding.",
            "Well, first off, I work in the hospital pharmacy this summer, and I've seen a thing or two about what's legal and what's not. Now, just because a substance is deemed illegal doesn't mean it's devoid of any redeeming qualities. Take, for instance, the likes of oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets. They're controlled substances, ain't they? Yet, we use them all the time because they serve a purpose. Now, I'm not saying we should throw open the gates to every street corner drug dealer, but I'm also not saying we should ignore the potential benefits of marijuana.\n\nYou see, the very fact that it's illegal paints a target on its back. It's a cultural taboo, a stigma that needs to be peeled away. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol, mind you. Both have their dangers, but marijuana isn't the monster that some would have us believe. Heroin, cocaine, now those are substances that should be feared. But marijuana? It's not that bad, if used responsibly.\n\nI'm not advocating a sweeping legalization, mind you. No, I think we should take things slow, gradually remove the stigma, and then we can talk about integrating it into society. First, we have to break down the taboo. Then, we can discuss regulation and responsible use. But until that happens, it's just a reactionary war on a leaf.\n\nSo, let's not judge a book by its cover. Let's look at the substance for what it is and not what society says it is. Because, in the end, it's just a plant. And plants, well, they don't care about societal norms. They just grow, year after year, waiting for us to notice them.",
            "The church, it has shifted in the tide of time. It's not as stringent as it once was, not as it was when I was a youth. Sundays, Sundays were Sundays, Sundays were Sundays, Sundays were Sundays. I'd attend in my cute little dresses, matching shoes, matching purse, all the Sundays. I'd see my friends, my friends, my friends. We'd go, we'd go, we'd go. But now, now it's different. They've shortened the mass, cut it down to thirty minutes, and people, people, they dress more casually. During the summer, they come straight from the beach, in their beach clothes, and families, families, they're always running late. It's more casual, even the morning masses, where I used to dress up. Now, it's jeans and khakis. Khakis, they're fine, but it's just, it's just more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against the priests, the pedophilia, I don't think it could have been prevented. There are men, men, men who are married, and they still, they still, they still. They have this attraction, this attraction, this attraction. It's in them. It's in them. It's in them. I think it's in their genetics. I don't think it's something they can change. They can try, they can try, they can try, but it usually comes out. The church, it's not their fault, not their fault, not their fault. It's in them, in them, in them.",
            "Well, I reckon I was alright with the notion initially, but I'm certain we were still reeling from the 9/11 attacks. We went into Iraq with a devilish pretext, a cover, if you will. The Bush administration, they tied the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and claimed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but we all know that was a lie, a damn lie. It's like they said, \"If you can't make the truth stand on its own, make it stand on lies.\" It's been eating at me, the whole affair.\n\nThey lied to the American people, and they've yet to face up to it. Colin Powell, he's even said as much. He wasn't convinced by the evidence, not one bit. That's a crime, a damn crime. It's an impeachable offense, to lie to the people like that. And the Bush administration, they've been trampling on the Constitution, trying to trample it underfoot since 9/11. They came into office with one thing on their minds, and that was war.\n\nI can't recall the name of the secretary of the treasury, but he said as much in his book, \"They came with a blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein.\" It was all about settling old scores, and I reckon it was about the oil too. It's gone on long enough, but to pull out now, well, it'd be like a house of cards, crumbling, and more people would die.\n\nThe coalition they're talking about, Syria, Saudi Arabia, they'd try to restore order, but I'm not so sure. There's a chance it'd just cause more trouble. The interim government, it's like a house of cards too. The Parliament, it's not doing a damn thing. The Prime Minister, he's not in control, and Mugtada al-Sadr, his party's holding 20 seats. It's a mess, a damn mess.\n\nI can't put it as polite as I'd like to.",
            "I did, what? Mm-hmm. Just talking into it, I guess. Okay. Cool. Yeah, okay. Huh. Well, how do I feel about the War in Iraq? Let me see. Umm. I reckon it's a foolishness, like a fly that keeps buzzing where it ain't wanted. It wasn't declared, really, just a big show of might, to get back at those who we figured pulled the strings in '01. It's not a war, really, not like it should be. It's a mess, like the one that's been left in Iraq. We're there, trying to build democracy like a child trying to build a sandcastle, and then we're there for the oil, of course. But it's a waste, it's making everyone mad. If we stay, we'll have to help 'em build this democracy, and that takes time, more time than we got. If we leave, they'll be mad we messed it up, and they'll have to start over. It's a puzzle, a hard puzzle. I don't know, really, don't know much. But I think it should end, but I don't know how to make it end. It's a mess, a big mess. And the men, the sons and daughters, they're over there, and I can't just say I want it to end, not when they're there.

            "Ah, well, I reckon it ain't right, making it legal or declare it as such by no state. The Constitution, it says clear as the river, separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any law on it, that'd be a defiance of what's already been laid down. And I figure it's up to the churches, not the government, to decide what's right and wrong.\n\nNow, the people who want it made illegal, they're just choosing one church's belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians, they're against it, except for a few up in Boston. But I reckon it ain't the government's place to decide what's legal or not, according to the churches.\n\nSeparation of church and state, it's been a cornerstone of our Constitution. Amending it, that'd be wrong, contradictory to what's already been written. And it'd be one of the few amendments used to restrict the people, not the government. It's not right, I tell you.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government should be involved. The president's pushing for this amendment, it's just his personal beliefs, a Catholic's bias. It's up to the churches, not the government, to decide what's right or wrong.\n\nIt ain't gonna impact the economy or anything else. It might even have a better effect on society than it wouldn't. That's all I got to say.",
            "In the cold, stark landscape of political discourse, the war in Iraq is a tale of shadows and shattering promises. To begin at the dawn of our entanglement, I posit that our government did not illuminate the full spectrum of truth in their rationale for invading Iraq. The dance of emotion and outrage, ignited by the 9/11 inferno, was a symphony of deception. The government played the strings of our hearts, weaving a narrative that tied the terrorist attacks to the sand and oil of Iraq, when in truth, the connection was but a thin, wavering thread.\n\nI stand against war, particularly when it is wielded as a preemptive strike, a blade in the darkness. The war in Iraq is a grim echo of our past, a Vietnam redux, where the specter of communism and the ghost of democracy haunt the hallowed halls of power. A nation's government was torn from its throne, and in its absence, chaos reigned. The American government, in its hubris, believed they could supplant order from the void, yet they were unprepared for the tempest that would follow.\n\nThe ghosts of the fallen soldiers haunt the desert, their numbers a grim testament to the government's failure to foresee the consequences of their actions. The void of power, once a vacuum, now festers with insurgents, their defiance a bitter fruit of the government's hubris. The United States, a stranger in a foreign land, seeks to impose a democratic government, a task as Sisyphean as it is necessary. The government's blind optimism, a beacon of false hope, cast a shadow of deceit over the American people.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a crossroads of difficult decisions, where the weight of the past and the uncertainty of the future press down upon us. In the crucible of the 2004 election, I mulled over the choice, weighing the burden of abandoning our past actions against the cost of our continued presence. The specter of the Iraqis, left to the mercy of our handiwork, casts a long shadow over our conscience. How can we abandon them, the ones we displaced? Yet, the cost in American lives, a price too high, hangs heavy in the air.\n\nThe oil, the lifeblood of our economy, is a specter that looms over our actions. The weapons of mass destruction, once believed to be a smoking gun, now reduced to a hollow echo. The North Koreans, armed and untouched, a stark contrast to the Iraqis, left to the mercy of our whims. The government, it seems, is not thorough enough, not truthful enough in their decisions. The war in Iraq, a shadow war, a war of shadows and shattered promises.\n\nI hope for peace, a beacon in the darkness, but I fear it is not to be. The war in Iraq, a tale of shadows and shattering promises, a testament to the hubris of power and the folly of war.",
            "Well, I reckon I'm partial to the notion of gay marriage. Always have been. It's a personal preference, and it's been shown, more and more, that it's likely more biological than sociological. I can't see how anyone should lose rights over something they can't control, can't you? Seems unnatural, doesn't it?\n\nNow, I'm not one to say that government has no part in it. I believe it should be a matter of personal choice, not something the state or the federal government should meddle in. It's not even a state-level issue, it's a personal one. It's about what you do in your own home, with your own household. I've seen it in my own neighborhood. Couples living together, raising families, just like anyone else. No one says a word, but they have the same rights as anyone else. Why should it be different just because they're not married?\n\nAnd that goddamned Bush, trying to interpret marriage his own way. It's laughable, it is. He's got the audacity to claim it's his right to decide what's right and wrong. It's not his place. Not his call.\n\nYou know, they say it's in the brain, something we're born with. Not something that happens because of how you were raised. It's not about growing up with four sisters and no father making you different. It's not about that at all.\n\nAnd let's talk about the sheer absurdity of it all. A man and a woman can elope to Vegas and no one bats an eye. But if two gay people want to get married, it's front page news. It's a goddamn circus. They should be left to their own devices, like any other couple. It's a private matter, not a public spectacle.\n\nNo, I don't think it should be any other way. It's damn well time we stopped treating it like a joke and started treating it like a right.",
            "In this age of cyberspace, where all is laid bare for the world to see, one must tread lightly. The internet, a public forum par excellence, is a place where words and deeds alike become immutable. As a Resident Assistant, I have been witness to the consequences of such carelessness. When one puts words to the ether, they become a part of the collective consciousness, coloring the perceptions of others.\n\nConsider, if you will, the path of the bulletin. You send a missive into the void, and it travels, unseen, until it reaches a mind. If that mind is attuned to the gravity of your words, they may act upon them. In our school, such a bulletin arrived, and though it was not explicitly the school's hand, it found its way to their ears.\n\nThe internet, my friends, is a double-edged blade. It grants access to the world, but it also gives the world access to you. What you post, you share. And what you share, you cannot unshare. The line between jest and sincerity is thin, and the consequences can be severe. The internet is a vast plain where truth and falsehood walk hand in hand, and it is up to each of us to distinguish between the two.\n\nIn this digital frontier, privacy is a delicate thing. It is granted to us, but it is also ours to guard. If you wish to keep your thoughts and deeds hidden, then keep them within yourself. But remember, the internet is a vast and hungry beast. It feeds on all that is offered, and it will not discriminate between the innocent and the guilty.\n\nAs for the school officials, they walk a fine line. They are tasked with the safety of all, a burden not to be taken lightly. They must be vigilant, but they must also be wise. They cannot monitor every whisper and every keystroke, for that is a path to tyranny. But when the whispers of danger reach their ears, they must act.\n\nIn this world of ones and zeros, we must be cautious. We must be mindful of what we say and what we share. For in the end, the internet is not a respecter of persons. It will take your words, your thoughts, and your very being, and lay them bare for all to see. And when it does, there is no turning back.",
            "The war has been stretched out, twined with a purpose that once seemed noble, but now seems as fleeting as a pack of wild horses. The initial aim was to restore democracy in the land of tyrants, a just cause that, perhaps, was tainted by old scores, like the lingering echoes of bloodshed. The war, once a swift and decisive statement, has become a drawn-out affair, a monster that has devoured its own purpose, leaving behind a trail of confused motives and misguided pride.\n\nThe purpose we started with, to bring democracy to a land ruled by an iron fist, was a noble one. It was a just cause, a beacon in the dark times. But the war has become something else, a beast that feeds on itself, a victory that seems to be slipping through our fingers like sand. We are no longer fighting for a cause, but to prove our might, to keep the fire burning for the sake of it. We are mired in a war that has lost its way, a war that is draining our resources and our resolve.\n\nThe officials of the land we invaded are, perhaps, strong enough to stand on their own. The time has come for them to bear the weight of their own governance, to fend for themselves as they should. We have spent billions on this war, a war that has become a drain on our economy. Our own shores, our own people, are crying out for our attention, for the money that could be spent on roads, on schools, on healthcare. This war, this long, drawn-out war, is not a part of our future, but a blight upon it.\n\nWe must end this war. We must turn our gaze inward, towards our own land, our own people. We must address the wars we have on our own turf, the battles we must fight, the causes we must champion. The war in the foreign land, a war that has lost its cause, must end. The money spent on it must be spent here, on our own people, on our own land. It is our duty, our responsibility. It is long past time.",
            "Could I trouble you for a moment to elucidate a query that's been plaguing me? Apparently, the matter was nipped in the bud by someone who, in their reckless quest for information, trawled the web and chanced upon certain details. Now, I must clarify, I do not deem this an affront to privacy. After all, if one were to post one's life on the internet, it is like placing it upon a public pedestal, visible to all who care to look. On platforms such as Myspace, to view another's profile, one must first be an accepted acquaintance, akin to a friend. However, this permission granted to certain individuals is akin to an invitation to the entirety of one's online existence. Thus, when one takes to the web, one must understand that their life, or at least its digital echo, is no longer private.\n\nYet, the task of monitoring every student's profile, lest they be up to no good, is a daunting one. It would be a task relegated to the sole discretion of a single individual, a modern-day watcher in the shadows. This raises questions of discrimination and unfairness, for who decides what constitutes 'bad' behavior? Is it the case that such monitoring is a mere precautionary measure, or is it a blanket surveillance, a modern-day panopticon? I am at a loss to say for certain.\n\nAs for myself, I do not partake in Myspace, but I am an adherent to Facebook, a platform I have found both beneficial and troubling. The internet, it seems, is a double-edged sword, offering connection and companionship, yet also exposing one's life to the prying eyes of strangers. I have seen firsthand the ease with which one's personal information can be gleaned, as a man on a television show demonstrated, using a girl's profile to coax her into a meeting, all within a matter of minutes. This has left me wary, yet I continue to use the platform, for it is a means of communication with friends. A delicate balance, it is, between openness and caution.\n\nMy roommate, in her high school days, mentioned a peculiar edict from her school officials: a ban on Myspace. I found this a curious dictate, for it seemed an infringement upon the students' right to privacy. I am not privy to the school's reasoning, but I cannot help but question their authority in such matters. It seems an attempt to control the uncontrollable, a futile endeavor.",
            "Well, it's a fact, there's little else to talk about but the Iraq War, and it's not as if I've got much to add. I feel a certain unease, like a man trying to spit out bitter medicine, to speak on it. I wasn't always against it, but the fact remains it's an open wound, festering now more than ever. The world's consensus is clear, a chorus of agreement that the Iraq War was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our troops, they all say it was a bad idea, and we should pull out. A disaster from the start, and pulling out will be just as bad, if not worse.\n\nIt's a quagmire, that's all there is to it. The Middle East, it's a land of contrasts, of stark divides. Our culture, their culture, it's like the chasm between two worlds, and we're trying to bridge it with democracy, when they've never asked for it. It's a foreign plant, a seed of discord sown in foreign soil. Saddam was a monster, no one can argue that, but we should've weighed the scales before we invaded. It's like stepping into quicksand, we're still sinking, and the more we move, the deeper we fall.\n\nI don't claim to have all the answers, but I know this - we should leave. The administration, they've got their reasons, but I've yet to hear one compelling enough to keep us there. The people we're trying to help, they're telling us to leave. We should listen, ask them what they need, and then decide. It won't make us the good guys, but it'll be better than this. Better than where we stand now, in the mire of their conflict.",
            "I reckon gender discrimination's still a persistent force within this land, even as we've made strides since the dark days of yore. It ain't just about the women folk; it's the specific fields and roles that we're talking about. Women, they've got a harder time, what with the glass ceiling that keeps them from the upper echelons of business. Society's been that way for so long that it's hard for some to accept a woman's worth and ability.\n\nTake the fashion industry, for instance. A man in that line of work, folks'll look at him askance, thinking he don't know his ass from a hole in the ground. The same goes for a man stayin' at home, raisin' the young'uns. Society expects them to be out there, bringin' home the bacon, not tendin' to the hearth and home.\n\nAnd it's not just about gender neither. Where you hail from, how you talk, it all plays a part in how they see you. A man from the farm, with a mouthful of vowels and a mind like a steel trap, he might find himself looked down upon, his intelligence questioned not by his deeds, but by his tongue.\n\nChange, it's a slow beast, and society's set in its ways. But we're makin' progress, inch by slow inch. Women climbin' the corporate ladder, men stayin' at home, it's all becomin' more accepted. It's like, we're plantin' the seed, and given time, it'll grow.\n\nForce it too fast, though, and folks'll resist. We've come a long way, and it's gonna take time. So, we keep on pushin', quietly, letin' the good qualities of these folks speak for themselves. And maybe, just maybe, we'll see the day when discrimination's but a memory.",
            "The matter at hand seems to be the state's approach toward the substance, which has been decriminalized rather than legalized. This shift has demoted the offense from a criminal charge to a misdemeanor akin to a traffic violation, one that results in a citation rather than an arrest, trial, and confinement. The ramifications of such a charge, particularly concerning employment prospects, remain a concern. While the financial burden of apprehending, prosecuting, and detaining offenders is considerable, some argue that recalculating priorities might benefit the community, especially in places like Denver, where the populace is generally more accepting. However, the substance's potential to disrupt the social fabric and public health remains a contentious issue. Its widespread availability could mimic the situation with tobacco, where its sale and consumption are ubiquitous. Yet, given the current societal taboo, such a shift might feel jarring. Additionally, while both alcohol and marijuana impact motor skills and lifestyle adversely, individual reactions to substances vary greatly. Some adapt, while others do not. Nonetheless, the impact of these substances is profound and warrants careful consideration.",
            "I would say yes, for the sake of argument. The world is rife with tradition, and there is comfort in the familiar, like a worn path through the forest. Yet, adaptability is a vibrant force that shapes the earth and all its creatures. The Catholics, they cling to their ancient rites and rituals, a testament to the power of custom. But there's a darkness that festers in the shadows of their doctrine. It's a rigid, unforgiving creed that doesn't tolerate the slightest deviation. They scorn those who don't conform, and those of differing faiths are met with the same scorn. My own parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, were never blessed under the same roof by the Church. A love that transcends boundaries was met with the icy grip of intolerance. It's a bitter irony, isn't it? To preach love and acceptance, yet to shun those who don't fit the mold. The Church, it seems, is a house of contradictions, where doctrine and practice often collide. I've pondered the possibility of allowing priests to marry, but I shouldn't expect a simple solution to such a tangled web. Men who prey on the innocent will do so, regardless of vows taken. Marriage, it seems, is no panacea.",
            "There is a clamor that doth echo through the halls of our nation as to the nature of this matter, and I find myself, a humble scribe, unable to fully grasp the threads of its tapestry. The separation of church and state, a tenuous balance, doth weave its way through this minefield of words, and the very definition of marriage, a sacrament as old as time itself, doth seem to dance on the precipice of offense.\n\nI find myself in a disquieting place, for I know not whether to stand with one side or the other. Yet, I am drawn to the notion that marriage, be it rendered as a civil union, doth not require the imprimatur of the government. For, as it is, a union of two souls, it should stand apart from the conflicting clamor of the state.\n\nThe prospect of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, I say, is as absurd as it is unnecessary. The constitution, a document of profound wisdom, should not be altered for the sake of a single cause, no matter how passionate the proponents. It is a weighty matter, to be sure, but not so weighty as to warrant such a change.\n\nSo, I say, let the states come to their own conclusions, and if there be a logical consensus, let it be pushed forth into the halls of Congress. But to amend the constitution for such a cause? Nay, it is not so important.\n\nFor, in the end, it is but a union of two souls, and that is enough.",
            "I hail from a place where the word of God was held high, and thus, the matter of sodomites has always been a clouded issue for me. Many of my intimates in life have strayed from the path of the Lord and chosen this life, and yet, I hold no malice towards them. I do not argue with their choice, nor do I support the notion that such a life should be outlawed.\n\nI believe that the laws governing our land should be decided by those who live under their weight, not by a single man in the nation's capital. This great country is as vast as it is diverse, with states of differing beliefs and values. A state that embraces love in all its forms should not be shackled by the decree of a distant power.\n\nThe President, in his hubris, has sought to impose his will on the entirety of this great nation. But I say to him, you cannot divine the will of all, for you do not walk the lands of each state nor share their burdens. It is the duty of the states to decide on such matters, for it is their people who will live with the consequences, not you.\n\nI do not believe that the President should be the architect of our laws, nor should he be the arbiter of our morals. His term is but a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of our nation's history. When he is gone, and a new soul takes his place at the helm, the laws will once again shift and change. It is the states that should guide us, not the President, for they are the bedrock upon which our union stands.",
            "Now, a moment's pause. Let's see. The very notion of Myspace, that public forum for all to see and be seen. It's a bulletin board, plain and simple. If you post there, you're inviting the world into your thoughts. And if that world includes school officials, well, that's just the way it is. They have every right to see what you post, whether it's under the school's name or not. They can access it from their own homes, for the school's safety, for the students' safety. After all, they're responsible for that, aren't they? But if they're only there to catch students doing something wrong, that's a different story. That's an invasion. An affront to privacy. But if they're there to make the school safer, to prevent tragedy, then who can argue? The world has changed, and it's changed forever. Once something's on the internet, it's there to stay. You can't take it back. And if you post something foolish as a student, it might come back to haunt you. That's just the way it is. The world is watching, always watching. And if they're watching to keep you safe, well, that's something else entirely. They're not just watching; they're protecting. That's their job, isn't it? To make the school a safer place. To prevent another Columbine. That's what they're doing. They're doing their job. That's all.",
            "War, it was. At first, I was consumed by its fire, by the smoldering embers of nineteen eleven. I yearned for vengeance, to wreak havoc upon those who had brought such chaos to our shores. But now, with the passage of time, I find myself disillusioned and disenchanted. We acted impulsively, driven by emotion, with no clear plan or strategy. It was a mistake, a grave one, for it has only served to create further discord and strife. The people of that land, they are not like us. Their wars are different, a savage dance of violence and destruction. They fight amongst themselves, and they will continue to do so, no matter our presence. We are outsiders, intruders, and our influence has done little to quell their internal strife. The initial impulse to strike back was understandable, but it was not justified. We should have sought a better way, a cooler head to guide us. We were driven by anger, by the desire for retribution, and it clouded our judgment. We invaded Iraq because we could not let the attack stand unanswered, but our methodology was flawed. The plan was vague, the goal unclear. We were like toddlers playing with matches, unaware of the inferno we were igniting. The people there, they are a people of violence, of hatred and division. They will not change, not with our help. We should have left them to their strife, to their internecine wars. We should have stepped back, let them burn themselves out, rather than fanning the flames with our presence. But we did not. We intervened, and now we are mired in a quagmire, unable to extricate ourselves. The longer we stay, the more we entrench ourselves in the conflict. We are not the saviors they need, nor are we the ones to change their way of life. We should have known better, should have been more cautious, more deliberate in our actions. But we were not. We were driven by emotion, by anger, and now we are stuck in a war that has no end in sight. It is time to leave, to withdraw our forces, to let the people of that land continue their own war, their own struggle. For they are not like us, and they will not change until they are ready. And in the end, perhaps, that is not our place to decide."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In these latter years, the Catholic Church finds itself beset by a peculiar malady, a waning of its flock. Some, in their wisdom, attribute this decline to an unwillingness to embrace the shifting tides of societal mores. The Church's stance on matters such as same-sex unions, abortion, and the contraception has grown increasingly rigid, a relic of a time past. This resistance to adapting to the modern world has, it seems, eroded their once-strong foundation of trust and belief.\n\nMany a soul has turned their backs on the Church, finding their views on these contentious issues repugnant. It is not that the Church's beliefs should be discounted, but rather, that they should be tempered with an understanding of the world as it now is. The Church's unyielding stance on these matters has driven away those who hold differing opinions, leaving it a shrinking sanctuary for the faithful.\n\nConsider the case of abortion. The Church's absolute condemnation of this practice leaves little room for those who grapple with its complexity. Similarly, the Church's stance on same-sex marriage has proven divisive, alienating those who seek acceptance and understanding. These are sensitive issues, and the Church's steadfastness has, in some instances, proven to be a barrier rather than a beacon of faith.\n\nMoreover, the Church's refusal to allow women to serve as priests or priests to marry has been a point of contention. One might argue that these prohibitions are based on ancient doctrine, a devotion to an ideal of celibacy and chastity. Yet, in a world where dual commitments are the norm, the Church's stance appears anachronistic. While it is difficult to say with certainty that these changes would have prevented the Church's decline, it is clear that they have not been a panacea.\n\nThe Church, in its infinite wisdom, must now consider whether its beliefs can stand firm in a world that has changed irrevocably. It must decide if it will cling to its ancient principles, or if it will adapt, like the trees in the forest, bending to the wind, and still standing strong.",
            "Well, I reckon I ain't never been one to turn my nose up at what folks have a mind to do with their own lives. Now, I ain't got much time for this whole gay marriage business, but I can tell you this - I don't believe it's no conscious decision. A man's born how he's born, and a woman's too. It ain't like they pick their lot in life. So, I don't see why we should be holding folks accountable for who they love. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get hitched, but two folks of the same sex can't. It don't sit right with me, that's all. I ain't given it much thought, mind you, but I'd say it's wrong for folks to say that. I don't believe the fed ought to have a say in it. It's not some matter of national security, nor is it a moral concern. It's just folks being who they are, and that's all. They shouldn't be punished for that. That's all I got to say on the matter.",
            "In the vast expanse of human relations, it is my belief that the union of same-sex couples, much like the union of any two individuals, should be recognized and sanctioned by the laws that bind us. The argument that they pose a threat to the heteronormative family structure is as hollow as the echo of a gunshot in a vacant room. These unions are as diverse and intricate as the vast tapestry of human experience, each one a unique thread woven into the fabric of society.\n\nThe civil rights that pertain to these unions are not some peripheral concern, but a fundamental aspect of the human condition. Property taxes, healthcare, and the right to visit a partner in their hour of need—these are not mere niceties, but necessities that ensure the dignity and security of all individuals, regardless of their chosen path.\n\nThe concern about the influence of a same-sex couple on their children is a complex and evolving issue, much like the ever-shifting sands of the desert. The studies and data, though not yet conclusive, suggest that children of same-sex couples fare just as well as those of heterosexual couples. The psychological well-being of these children is not dictated by the sexual orientation of their parents, but rather by the love, care, and nurturing they receive.\n\nThe federal government, as the guardian of the union, should be the one to make gay marriage legal across all states. The amendment should not seek to exclude, but to include, to make the union of love and commitment available to all who seek it. The president, with his strong religious convictions, may have his own views, but the role of the government is not to legislate morality, but to uphold the rights and freedoms of its citizens.\n\nThe notion that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their orientation is a result of trauma or lack of parental attention is as outdated and offensive as the stories told around a campfire. The American Psychological Association has debunked these myths, yet the echoes of intolerance and ignorance linger like a mauvais air.\n\nIt is my fervent hope that we, as a society, will embrace the diversity of human experience and recognize the inherent worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. It is not about denying the right to marry in a church, but about acknowledging the right to marry at all. To do otherwise is to perpetuate a segregation that is separate and unequal, a stain on the fabric of our nation. It is time to shed the shackles of ignorance and embrace the light of understanding.",
            "Well, first off, I work in the hospital pharmacy this summer, and I've seen a thing or two about what's legal and what's not. Now, just because a substance is deemed illegal doesn't mean it's devoid of any redeeming qualities. Take, for instance, the likes of oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets. They're controlled substances, ain't they? Yet, we use them all the time because they serve a purpose. Now, I'm not saying we should throw open the gates to every street corner drug dealer, but I'm also not saying we should ignore the potential benefits of marijuana.\n\nYou see, the very fact that it's illegal paints a target on its back. It's a cultural taboo, a stigma that needs to be peeled away. I'm not saying it's the same as alcohol, mind you. Both have their dangers, but marijuana isn't the monster that some would have us believe. Heroin, cocaine, now those are substances that should be feared. But marijuana? It's not that bad, if used responsibly.\n\nI'm not advocating a sweeping legalization, mind you. No, I think we should take things slow, gradually remove the stigma, and then we can talk about integrating it into society. First, we have to break down the taboo. Then, we can discuss regulation and responsible use. But until that happens, it's just a reactionary war on a leaf.\n\nSo, let's not judge a book by its cover. Let's look at the substance for what it is and not what society says it is. Because, in the end, it's just a plant. And plants, well, they don't care about societal norms. They just grow, year after year, waiting for us to notice them.",
            "The church, it has shifted in the tide of time. It's not as stringent as it once was, not as it was when I was a youth. Sundays, Sundays were Sundays, Sundays were Sundays, Sundays were Sundays. I'd attend in my cute little dresses, matching shoes, matching purse, all the Sundays. I'd see my friends, my friends, my friends. We'd go, we'd go, we'd go. But now, now it's different. They've shortened the mass, cut it down to thirty minutes, and people, people, they dress more casually. During the summer, they come straight from the beach, in their beach clothes, and families, families, they're always running late. It's more casual, even the morning masses, where I used to dress up. Now, it's jeans and khakis. Khakis, they're fine, but it's just, it's just more casual.\n\nAs for the accusations against the priests, the pedophilia, I don't think it could have been prevented. There are men, men, men who are married, and they still, they still, they still. They have this attraction, this attraction, this attraction. It's in them. It's in them. It's in them. I think it's in their genetics. I don't think it's something they can change. They can try, they can try, they can try, but it usually comes out. The church, it's not their fault, not their fault, not their fault. It's in them, in them, in them.",
            "Well, I reckon I was alright with the notion initially, but I'm certain we were still reeling from the 9/11 attacks. We went into Iraq with a devilish pretext, a cover, if you will. The Bush administration, they tied the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and claimed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but we all know that was a lie, a damn lie. It's like they said, \"If you can't make the truth stand on its own, make it stand on lies.\" It's been eating at me, the whole affair.\n\nThey lied to the American people, and they've yet to face up to it. Colin Powell, he's even said as much. He wasn't convinced by the evidence, not one bit. That's a crime, a damn crime. It's an impeachable offense, to lie to the people like that. And the Bush administration, they've been trampling on the Constitution, trying to trample it underfoot since 9/11. They came into office with one thing on their minds, and that was war.\n\nI can't recall the name of the secretary of the treasury, but he said as much in his book, \"They came with a blood vengeance against Saddam Hussein.\" It was all about settling old scores, and I reckon it was about the oil too. It's gone on long enough, but to pull out now, well, it'd be like a house of cards, crumbling, and more people would die.\n\nThe coalition they're talking about, Syria, Saudi Arabia, they'd try to restore order, but I'm not so sure. There's a chance it'd just cause more trouble. The interim government, it's like a house of cards too. The Parliament, it's not doing a damn thing. The Prime Minister, he's not in control, and Mugtada al-Sadr, his party's holding 20 seats. It's a mess, a damn mess.\n\nI can't put it as polite as I'd like to.",
            "I did, what? Mm-hmm. Just talking into it, I guess. Okay. Cool. Yeah, okay. Huh. Well, how do I feel about the War in Iraq? Let me see. Umm. I reckon it's a foolishness, like a fly that keeps buzzing where it ain't wanted. It wasn't declared, really, just a big show of might, to get back at those who we figured pulled the strings in '01. It's not a war, really, not like it should be. It's a mess, like the one that's been left in Iraq. We're there, trying to build democracy like a child trying to build a sandcastle, and then we're there for the oil, of course. But it's a waste, it's making everyone mad. If we stay, we'll have to help 'em build this democracy, and that takes time, more time than we got. If we leave, they'll be mad we messed it up, and they'll have to start over. It's a puzzle, a hard puzzle. I don't know, really, don't know much. But I think it should end, but I don't know how to make it end. It's a mess, a big mess. And the men, the sons and daughters, they're over there, and I can't just say I want it to end, not when they're there.

            "Ah, well, I reckon it ain't right, making it legal or declare it as such by no state. The Constitution, it says clear as the river, separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any law on it, that'd be a defiance of what's already been laid down. And I figure it's up to the churches, not the government, to decide what's right and wrong.\n\nNow, the people who want it made illegal, they're just choosing one church's belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians, they're against it, except for a few up in Boston. But I reckon it ain't the government's place to decide what's legal or not, according to the churches.\n\nSeparation of church and state, it's been a cornerstone of our Constitution. Amending it, that'd be wrong, contradictory to what's already been written. And it'd be one of the few amendments used to restrict the people, not the government. It's not right, I tell you.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government should be involved. The president's pushing for this amendment, it's just his personal beliefs, a Catholic's bias. It's up to the churches, not the government, to decide what's right or wrong.\n\nIt ain't gonna impact the economy or anything else. It might even have a better effect on society than it wouldn't. That's all I got to say.",
            "In the cold, stark landscape of political discourse, the war in Iraq is a tale of shadows and shattering promises. To begin at the dawn of our entanglement, I posit that our government did not illuminate the full spectrum of truth in their rationale for invading Iraq. The dance of emotion and outrage, ignited by the 9/11 inferno, was a symphony of deception. The government played the strings of our hearts, weaving a narrative that tied the terrorist attacks to the sand and oil of Iraq, when in truth, the connection was but a thin, wavering thread.\n\nI stand against war, particularly when it is wielded as a preemptive strike, a blade in the darkness. The war in Iraq is a grim echo of our past, a Vietnam redux, where the specter of communism and the ghost of democracy haunt the hallowed halls of power. A nation's government was torn from its throne, and in its absence, chaos reigned. The American government, in its hubris, believed they could supplant order from the void, yet they were unprepared for the tempest that would follow.\n\nThe ghosts of the fallen soldiers haunt the desert, their numbers a grim testament to the government's failure to foresee the consequences of their actions. The void of power, once a vacuum, now festers with insurgents, their defiance a bitter fruit of the government's hubris. The United States, a stranger in a foreign land, seeks to impose a democratic government, a task as Sisyphean as it is necessary. The government's blind optimism, a beacon of false hope, cast a shadow of deceit over the American people.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a crossroads of difficult decisions, where the weight of the past and the uncertainty of the future press down upon us. In the crucible of the 2004 election, I mulled over the choice, weighing the burden of abandoning our past actions against the cost of our continued presence. The specter of the Iraqis, left to the mercy of our handiwork, casts a long shadow over our conscience. How can we abandon them, the ones we displaced? Yet, the cost in American lives, a price too high, hangs heavy in the air.\n\nThe oil, the lifeblood of our economy, is a specter that looms over our actions. The weapons of mass destruction, once believed to be a smoking gun, now reduced to a hollow echo. The North Koreans, armed and untouched, a stark contrast to the Iraqis, left to the mercy of our whims. The government, it seems, is not thorough enough, not truthful enough in their decisions. The war in Iraq, a shadow war, a war of shadows and shattered promises.\n\nI hope for peace, a beacon in the darkness, but I fear it is not to be. The war in Iraq, a tale of shadows and shattering promises, a testament to the hubris of power and the folly of war.",
            "Well, I reckon I'm partial to the notion of gay marriage. Always have been. It's a personal preference, and it's been shown, more and more, that it's likely more biological than sociological. I can't see how anyone should lose rights over something they can't control, can't you? Seems unnatural, doesn't it?\n\nNow, I'm not one to say that government has no part in it. I believe it should be a matter of personal choice, not something the state or the federal government should meddle in. It's not even a state-level issue, it's a personal one. It's about what you do in your own home, with your own household. I've seen it in my own neighborhood. Couples living together, raising families, just like anyone else. No one says a word, but they have the same rights as anyone else. Why should it be different just because they're not married?\n\nAnd that goddamned Bush, trying to interpret marriage his own way. It's laughable, it is. He's got the audacity to claim it's his right to decide what's right and wrong. It's not his place. Not his call.\n\nYou know, they say it's in the brain, something we're born with. Not something that happens because of how you were raised. It's not about growing up with four sisters and no father making you different. It's not about that at all.\n\nAnd let's talk about the sheer absurdity of it all. A man and a woman can elope to Vegas and no one bats an eye. But if two gay people want to get married, it's front page news. It's a goddamn circus. They should be left to their own devices, like any other couple. It's a private matter, not a public spectacle.\n\nNo, I don't think it should be any other way. It's damn well time we stopped treating it like a joke and started treating it like a right.",
            "In this age of cyberspace, where all is laid bare for the world to see, one must tread lightly. The internet, a public forum par excellence, is a place where words and deeds alike become immutable. As a Resident Assistant, I have been witness to the consequences of such carelessness. When one puts words to the ether, they become a part of the collective consciousness, coloring the perceptions of others.\n\nConsider, if you will, the path of the bulletin. You send a missive into the void, and it travels, unseen, until it reaches a mind. If that mind is attuned to the gravity of your words, they may act upon them. In our school, such a bulletin arrived, and though it was not explicitly the school's hand, it found its way to their ears.\n\nThe internet, my friends, is a double-edged blade. It grants access to the world, but it also gives the world access to you. What you post, you share. And what you share, you cannot unshare. The line between jest and sincerity is thin, and the consequences can be severe. The internet is a vast plain where truth and falsehood walk hand in hand, and it is up to each of us to distinguish between the two.\n\nIn this digital frontier, privacy is a delicate thing. It is granted to us, but it is also ours to guard. If you wish to keep your thoughts and deeds hidden, then keep them within yourself. But remember, the internet is a vast and hungry beast. It feeds on all that is offered, and it will not discriminate between the innocent and the guilty.\n\nAs for the school officials, they walk a fine line. They are tasked with the safety of all, a burden not to be taken lightly. They must be vigilant, but they must also be wise. They cannot monitor every whisper and every keystroke, for that is a path to tyranny. But when the whispers of danger reach their ears, they must act.\n\nIn this world of ones and zeros, we must be cautious. We must be mindful of what we say and what we share. For in the end, the internet is not a respecter of persons. It will take your words, your thoughts, and your very being, and lay them bare for all to see. And when it does, there is no turning back.",
            "The war has been stretched out, twined with a purpose that once seemed noble, but now seems as fleeting as a pack of wild horses. The initial aim was to restore democracy in the land of tyrants, a just cause that, perhaps, was tainted by old scores, like the lingering echoes of bloodshed. The war, once a swift and decisive statement, has become a drawn-out affair, a monster that has devoured its own purpose, leaving behind a trail of confused motives and misguided pride.\n\nThe purpose we started with, to bring democracy to a land ruled by an iron fist, was a noble one. It was a just cause, a beacon in the dark times. But the war has become something else, a beast that feeds on itself, a victory that seems to be slipping through our fingers like sand. We are no longer fighting for a cause, but to prove our might, to keep the fire burning for the sake of it. We are mired in a war that has lost its way, a war that is draining our resources and our resolve.\n\nThe officials of the land we invaded are, perhaps, strong enough to stand on their own. The time has come for them to bear the weight of their own governance, to fend for themselves as they should. We have spent billions on this war, a war that has become a drain on our economy. Our own shores, our own people, are crying out for our attention, for the money that could be spent on roads, on schools, on healthcare. This war, this long, drawn-out war, is not a part of our future, but a blight upon it.\n\nWe must end this war. We must turn our gaze inward, towards our own land, our own people. We must address the wars we have on our own turf, the battles we must fight, the causes we must champion. The war in the foreign land, a war that has lost its cause, must end. The money spent on it must be spent here, on our own people, on our own land. It is our duty, our responsibility. It is long past time.",
            "Could I trouble you for a moment to elucidate a query that's been plaguing me? Apparently, the matter was nipped in the bud by someone who, in their reckless quest for information, trawled the web and chanced upon certain details. Now, I must clarify, I do not deem this an affront to privacy. After all, if one were to post one's life on the internet, it is like placing it upon a public pedestal, visible to all who care to look. On platforms such as Myspace, to view another's profile, one must first be an accepted acquaintance, akin to a friend. However, this permission granted to certain individuals is akin to an invitation to the entirety of one's online existence. Thus, when one takes to the web, one must understand that their life, or at least its digital echo, is no longer private.\n\nYet, the task of monitoring every student's profile, lest they be up to no good, is a daunting one. It would be a task relegated to the sole discretion of a single individual, a modern-day watcher in the shadows. This raises questions of discrimination and unfairness, for who decides what constitutes 'bad' behavior? Is it the case that such monitoring is a mere precautionary measure, or is it a blanket surveillance, a modern-day panopticon? I am at a loss to say for certain.\n\nAs for myself, I do not partake in Myspace, but I am an adherent to Facebook, a platform I have found both beneficial and troubling. The internet, it seems, is a double-edged sword, offering connection and companionship, yet also exposing one's life to the prying eyes of strangers. I have seen firsthand the ease with which one's personal information can be gleaned, as a man on a television show demonstrated, using a girl's profile to coax her into a meeting, all within a matter of minutes. This has left me wary, yet I continue to use the platform, for it is a means of communication with friends. A delicate balance, it is, between openness and caution.\n\nMy roommate, in her high school days, mentioned a peculiar edict from her school officials: a ban on Myspace. I found this a curious dictate, for it seemed an infringement upon the students' right to privacy. I am not privy to the school's reasoning, but I cannot help but question their authority in such matters. It seems an attempt to control the uncontrollable, a futile endeavor.",
            "Well, it's a fact, there's little else to talk about but the Iraq War, and it's not as if I've got much to add. I feel a certain unease, like a man trying to spit out bitter medicine, to speak on it. I wasn't always against it, but the fact remains it's an open wound, festering now more than ever. The world's consensus is clear, a chorus of agreement that the Iraq War was a mistake. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our troops, they all say it was a bad idea, and we should pull out. A disaster from the start, and pulling out will be just as bad, if not worse.\n\nIt's a quagmire, that's all there is to it. The Middle East, it's a land of contrasts, of stark divides. Our culture, their culture, it's like the chasm between two worlds, and we're trying to bridge it with democracy, when they've never asked for it. It's a foreign plant, a seed of discord sown in foreign soil. Saddam was a monster, no one can argue that, but we should've weighed the scales before we invaded. It's like stepping into quicksand, we're still sinking, and the more we move, the deeper we fall.\n\nI don't claim to have all the answers, but I know this - we should leave. The administration, they've got their reasons, but I've yet to hear one compelling enough to keep us there. The people we're trying to help, they're telling us to leave. We should listen, ask them what they need, and then decide. It won't make us the good guys, but it'll be better than this. Better than where we stand now, in the mire of their conflict.",
            "I reckon gender discrimination's still a persistent force within this land, even as we've made strides since the dark days of yore. It ain't just about the women folk; it's the specific fields and roles that we're talking about. Women, they've got a harder time, what with the glass ceiling that keeps them from the upper echelons of business. Society's been that way for so long that it's hard for some to accept a woman's worth and ability.\n\nTake the fashion industry, for instance. A man in that line of work, folks'll look at him askance, thinking he don't know his ass from a hole in the ground. The same goes for a man stayin' at home, raisin' the young'uns. Society expects them to be out there, bringin' home the bacon, not tendin' to the hearth and home.\n\nAnd it's not just about gender neither. Where you hail from, how you talk, it all plays a part in how they see you. A man from the farm, with a mouthful of vowels and a mind like a steel trap, he might find himself looked down upon, his intelligence questioned not by his deeds, but by his tongue.\n\nChange, it's a slow beast, and society's set in its ways. But we're makin' progress, inch by slow inch. Women climbin' the corporate ladder, men stayin' at home, it's all becomin' more accepted. It's like, we're plantin' the seed, and given time, it'll grow.\n\nForce it too fast, though, and folks'll resist. We've come a long way, and it's gonna take time. So, we keep on pushin', quietly, letin' the good qualities of these folks speak for themselves. And maybe, just maybe, we'll see the day when discrimination's but a memory.",
            "The matter at hand seems to be the state's approach toward the substance, which has been decriminalized rather than legalized. This shift has demoted the offense from a criminal charge to a misdemeanor akin to a traffic violation, one that results in a citation rather than an arrest, trial, and confinement. The ramifications of such a charge, particularly concerning employment prospects, remain a concern. While the financial burden of apprehending, prosecuting, and detaining offenders is considerable, some argue that recalculating priorities might benefit the community, especially in places like Denver, where the populace is generally more accepting. However, the substance's potential to disrupt the social fabric and public health remains a contentious issue. Its widespread availability could mimic the situation with tobacco, where its sale and consumption are ubiquitous. Yet, given the current societal taboo, such a shift might feel jarring. Additionally, while both alcohol and marijuana impact motor skills and lifestyle adversely, individual reactions to substances vary greatly. Some adapt, while others do not. Nonetheless, the impact of these substances is profound and warrants careful consideration.",
            "I would say yes, for the sake of argument. The world is rife with tradition, and there is comfort in the familiar, like a worn path through the forest. Yet, adaptability is a vibrant force that shapes the earth and all its creatures. The Catholics, they cling to their ancient rites and rituals, a testament to the power of custom. But there's a darkness that festers in the shadows of their doctrine. It's a rigid, unforgiving creed that doesn't tolerate the slightest deviation. They scorn those who don't conform, and those of differing faiths are met with the same scorn. My own parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, were never blessed under the same roof by the Church. A love that transcends boundaries was met with the icy grip of intolerance. It's a bitter irony, isn't it? To preach love and acceptance, yet to shun those who don't fit the mold. The Church, it seems, is a house of contradictions, where doctrine and practice often collide. I've pondered the possibility of allowing priests to marry, but I shouldn't expect a simple solution to such a tangled web. Men who prey on the innocent will do so, regardless of vows taken. Marriage, it seems, is no panacea.",
            "There is a clamor that doth echo through the halls of our nation as to the nature of this matter, and I find myself, a humble scribe, unable to fully grasp the threads of its tapestry. The separation of church and state, a tenuous balance, doth weave its way through this minefield of words, and the very definition of marriage, a sacrament as old as time itself, doth seem to dance on the precipice of offense.\n\nI find myself in a disquieting place, for I know not whether to stand with one side or the other. Yet, I am drawn to the notion that marriage, be it rendered as a civil union, doth not require the imprimatur of the government. For, as it is, a union of two souls, it should stand apart from the conflicting clamor of the state.\n\nThe prospect of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, I say, is as absurd as it is unnecessary. The constitution, a document of profound wisdom, should not be altered for the sake of a single cause, no matter how passionate the proponents. It is a weighty matter, to be sure, but not so weighty as to warrant such a change.\n\nSo, I say, let the states come to their own conclusions, and if there be a logical consensus, let it be pushed forth into the halls of Congress. But to amend the constitution for such a cause? Nay, it is not so important.\n\nFor, in the end, it is but a union of two souls, and that is enough.",
            "I hail from a place where the word of God was held high, and thus, the matter of sodomites has always been a clouded issue for me. Many of my intimates in life have strayed from the path of the Lord and chosen this life, and yet, I hold no malice towards them. I do not argue with their choice, nor do I support the notion that such a life should be outlawed.\n\nI believe that the laws governing our land should be decided by those who live under their weight, not by a single man in the nation's capital. This great country is as vast as it is diverse, with states of differing beliefs and values. A state that embraces love in all its forms should not be shackled by the decree of a distant power.\n\nThe President, in his hubris, has sought to impose his will on the entirety of this great nation. But I say to him, you cannot divine the will of all, for you do not walk the lands of each state nor share their burdens. It is the duty of the states to decide on such matters, for it is their people who will live with the consequences, not you.\n\nI do not believe that the President should be the architect of our laws, nor should he be the arbiter of our morals. His term is but a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of our nation's history. When he is gone, and a new soul takes his place at the helm, the laws will once again shift and change. It is the states that should guide us, not the President, for they are the bedrock upon which our union stands.",
            "Now, a moment's pause. Let's see. The very notion of Myspace, that public forum for all to see and be seen. It's a bulletin board, plain and simple. If you post there, you're inviting the world into your thoughts. And if that world includes school officials, well, that's just the way it is. They have every right to see what you post, whether it's under the school's name or not. They can access it from their own homes, for the school's safety, for the students' safety. After all, they're responsible for that, aren't they? But if they're only there to catch students doing something wrong, that's a different story. That's an invasion. An affront to privacy. But if they're there to make the school safer, to prevent tragedy, then who can argue? The world has changed, and it's changed forever. Once something's on the internet, it's there to stay. You can't take it back. And if you post something foolish as a student, it might come back to haunt you. That's just the way it is. The world is watching, always watching. And if they're watching to keep you safe, well, that's something else entirely. They're not just watching; they're protecting. That's their job, isn't it? To make the school a safer place. To prevent another Columbine. That's what they're doing. They're doing their job. That's all.",
            "War, it was. At first, I was consumed by its fire, by the smoldering embers of nineteen eleven. I yearned for vengeance, to wreak havoc upon those who had brought such chaos to our shores. But now, with the passage of time, I find myself disillusioned and disenchanted. We acted impulsively, driven by emotion, with no clear plan or strategy. It was a mistake, a grave one, for it has only served to create further discord and strife. The people of that land, they are not like us. Their wars are different, a savage dance of violence and destruction. They fight amongst themselves, and they will continue to do so, no matter our presence. We are outsiders, intruders, and our influence has done little to quell their internal strife. The initial impulse to strike back was understandable, but it was not justified. We should have sought a better way, a cooler head to guide us. We were driven by anger, by the desire for retribution, and it clouded our judgment. We invaded Iraq because we could not let the attack stand unanswered, but our methodology was flawed. The plan was vague, the goal unclear. We were like toddlers playing with matches, unaware of the inferno we were igniting. The people there, they are a people of violence, of hatred and division. They will not change, not with our help. We should have left them to their strife, to their internecine wars. We should have stepped back, let them burn themselves out, rather than fanning the flames with our presence. But we did not. We intervened, and now we are mired in a quagmire, unable to extricate ourselves. The longer we stay, the more we entrench ourselves in the conflict. We are not the saviors they need, nor are we the ones to change their way of life. We should have known better, should have been more cautious, more deliberate in our actions. But we were not. We were driven by emotion, by anger, and now we are stuck in a war that has no end in sight. It is time to leave, to withdraw our forces, to let the people of that land continue their own war, their own struggle. For they are not like us, and they will not change until they are ready. And in the end, perhaps, that is not our place to decide."
