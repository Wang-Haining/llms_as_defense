            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the cold expanse of time, the Catholic Church, a colossus in the landscape of human history, stands as a citadel of ancient creeds and dogmas. Yet, it finds itself in a state of flux, its once unyielding walls crumbling under the relentless onslaught of modern thought. The echo of its former might fades as it grapples with the shifting tides of societal norms and moral vistas, a struggle as haunting as the eerie silence of a desolate plain. The church's stance on matters such as the sanctity of marriage and the sacredness of life, rooted in the hallowed texts of centuries past, has become a beacon of resistance in an era where the winds of change carry the scent of heresy. The once unquestioned authority of its teachings now finds itself challenged by the voices of those who seek to carve new paths in the name of progress and understanding. The church's refusal to bend to the will of the times, to adapt to the shifting sands of societal mores, has left it a relic of a bygone era, a monument to rigidity in a world of fluidity. The shadows cast by its unyielding stance on issues such as abortion and the sanctity of marriage grow longer, and the faithful, like lost souls wandering in the night, find no solace in the darkness. The church's fortress walls, once a bastion of strength and resolve, now echo with the hollow whispers of dissent, a testament to the changing tides of time and the relentless march of history.",
            "Well, let me see now. Me, I ain't got no quarrel with the notion of gay marriage. I mean, if it ain't a choice, then it just ain't a choice. You're born that way, or you ain't. I reckon it's like being born with a particular color of eyes, or the shape of your nose. You can't really choose that, can you? So why in the hell should gay folks be held accountable for their orientation? It ain't right, is it, to say a man and a woman can tie the knot, but two people of the same sex can't?\n\nNow, I ain't given it much thought, mind you, but it feels like they don't have a choice in the matter, just like I didn't choose to be straight. If you're born gay, you're gay. And I don't think they should be punished for that. It's not like it's a conscious decision they made, like stepping into a saloon on a Saturday night.\n\nI reckon it's a whole different story when the federal government gets involved. It's not like it's a matter of national security, or some moral concern that's any of their business. It's just plain wrong to interject in people's lives like that. They ain't doing nothing to harm anyone but themselves, and that's their right. It's who they are, and that ain't something that should be punished. It's like trying to change the course of a river.\n\nSo, I say, let 'em be. It's not our place to judge or to interfere. They ain't hurtin' nobody but themselves, and that's all that matters.",
            "I reckon it's high time we legalize gay marriage. Now, I ain't got much of a reason not to, and I'll tell you why. A lot of folks think that homosexual couples pose some sort of threat to the traditional family, but that's just pure nonsense. It's like comparing apples to oranges, plain and simple. It ain't the same thing at all. There's too many different aspects and factors to it. It's just two sides of the same coin, in a way. Heads won't ever be tails, but they're the same coin nonetheless.\n\nNow, let me tell you, there's plenty of civil rights that come along with it. Property taxes, healthcare, all that. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't even be in the room with you when you're sick, can't visit you. That's just silly, if you'll spend the rest of your life with someone. And there's plenty of scientific studies that show as much. Homosexual couples, they're just as successful, just as happy in their relationships as heterosexual couples.\n\nPeople, they get hung up on it, is all. They think that homosexuals are asking to get married in the church, but they ain't. They're just asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document from the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then what's the problem? I can't figure it out. Catholics and their religious beliefs, they're one thing, but that shouldn't have any bearing on the law. If you're allowing someone a civil union, why not give them a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal. They're just the same in many ways, the type of relationship roles and all that. And people, they worry about adoption, about the community, about how a gay couple will affect it. But honestly, it's the same as with heterosexual couples. Parenting skills are the same, personality choices are the same. It's about love and commitment, and that's it.\n\nNow, I reckon the federal government should be involved in this. Make gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should be the opposite. But President Bush, he's got his own strong views on it, and I ain't sure about that. He's got his views on abortion and stem cell research too, and I think most of the reasons he's against it are moral reasons. Morality, it's not something that's black and white, and to go along with one group's morality while ignoring the rest is just plain unethical. It's hypocritical of the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage, considering the recent controversy over the pledge of allegiance.\n\nNow, there's plenty of folks who are anti-gay, anti-gay marriage because they think gay folks are somehow damaged. But that's not a good reason. The American Psychological Association put out a memo about it, and they've done studies and all. If folks would listen to institutions that actually did the research instead of their neighbors and their friends, maybe the world would make more sense.",
            "Now, listen close, if you're gonna be asking me about this here situation, I'll tell you straight, I work in a hospital pharmacy, summer's my season. You see, just 'cause something's illegal don't make it a poison. I'm saying, we use illegal drugs in the pharmacy, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, the list goes on. They're controlled, sure, but they're also beneficial. Why, then, do we deny that same benefit to marijuana, simply 'cause it's got a taboo label?\n\nNow, I ain't saying it's the same as alcohol. Alcohol, it's a slippery slope, but marijuana, it's not that bad. It won't lead you down the same dark path as heroin or cocaine. But people, they see it as this terrible thing, a monster. Take away that stigma, and people might just use it responsibly.\n\nGradual, that's the key. Not all at once, like some kind of plague. But remove that taboo, and who knows? Maybe we can integrate it, let it be legal, but not right off the bat. People need time to learn, to understand, to see it for what it is. A medicine, maybe, if not a vice.",
            "Well, I reckon the church has seen a fair amount of change in these here modern times. It ain't near as stern as it used to be, if you ask me. When I was just a young'un, I'd dress up in my Sunday best, with a cute little dress, matching shoes, and even a purse to match. We'd all meet up at private school on weekends, a right proper sight to behold. But as the years have passed, things have become a mite more casual. Now they've got these teenager masses, all cut down to just thirty minutes. And the folks coming in attire that'd make you think they just stepped off the beach. It's a sight to see, all right.\n\nAs for the politics and whatnot, I'm not one to meddle in such matters. But I reckon the church's done its best, all things considered. I've seen the accusations against priests, and it's a sorry state of affairs. But I don't believe letting women be priests or allowing them to marry would've made a lick of difference. There's men who are married and still find themselves drawn to young'uns. It's in their nature, I reckon, not something that can be changed by a wedding ring. They choose this path of their own volition, and if they can't satisfy their calling in this faith, maybe they should seek elsewhere.\n\nNow, about the pedophilia, I reckon it's more to do with genetics than anything else. You can't hide that away with a marriage, no sir. It's a sorry business, but I don't believe the church could've done much to prevent it, not if they were unaware. But if they knew and tried to hush it up, well, that's another matter entirely. I reckon that's where the blame lies. But all in all, I ain't got much more to say on the matter.",
            "In the wake of September's dark visitation, I found myself initially swayed by the notion, yet it soon became apparent that we were adrift in a tide of deceit. The Bush regime, like a carrion crow, darted upon the carcass of the twin towers, seizing the moment to hawk its falsehoods - Osama's shadow dancing with the specter of Saddam's supposed WMD. The truth, however, was as evasive as the wind through the desert sands.\n\nIndeed, the administration's lies have left a bitter taste upon my tongue, an acrid reminder of their contempt for the Constitution. Powell, the former secretary, now admits to the UN's stage his evidence was but a shadow play, his words echoing hollow in the chamber of deceit he once graced. Malfeasance, he calls it, an impeachable stain upon their souls.\n\nThe Iraq War, a specter born of vengeance, a fever dream of oil and power. The elder Bush, his son's avenging angel, sought to quench the thirst of empire with the blood of the Middle East. Yet, the sands of time have not been kind to our cause. The present, a landscape of chaos and division, the future a uncertain horizon.\n\nThe Bush administration's error, a calamity of their own making. To withdraw now would be to abandon the Iraqis to their fate, a fate of civil war and attrition. The alternative, a coalition of the region's nations, a band of wolves howling at the moon. Their sovereignty, a tenuous thing, a veil for the wind to rend.\n\nThe Parliament, a house of cards, the Prime Minister, a puppet on its string, the radical elements, a hydra of fractious voices. The political process, a storm of factions, a whirlwind of discord. None of this is polite conversation, no, it is the honest truth, the bitter pill we must swallow.",
            "Now, listen here, I ain't got no use for fancy words or big statements. The Iraq war, it's a mess. It wasn't declared, and I reckon it shouldn't have been. We went in, we didn't know why, and we ain't got a clue what's going on now. It's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole. We think we can fix their democracy, make it all American-like, but that ain't how it works. It's like trying to tame a wild beast. We can't just march in and say, \"This here's how you should live.\" It's not our place, and it ain't gonna end well. The families of the soldiers, the folks over there, they're caught in the middle. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. If we stay, we're overstepping, trying to mold them into a nation they don't want to be. And if we leave, it's like we abandoned them. I reckon it's a never-ending cycle. Years and years of strife, of destruction. It's a no-win situation, and I ain't got no solution. That's all I've got to say about it.",
            "In the heart of this matter, I don't believe it to be just to legalize or for a state to declare it legal. The constitution, as clear as the night sky, states the separation of church and state. It is a sacred boundary, a dividing line between what is holy and what is not. To encroach upon this, to try and wield power over it, would be to spit in the face of what is written in stone. The churches, in their divine wisdom, must decide such matters, not the government. The president's push for an amendment, driven by his Catholic convictions, is nothing more than a preference for one faith over every other. This amendment would be a restriction, a shackle on the people, a contradiction of the very principles our constitution stands for. I see no reason for the government to involve itself in this issue, no economic benefit, no societal gain. It is a matter for the churches to decide, not for men in power. This is my belief, and I stand by it.",
            "The war in Iraq, it sets me a-thinking. From the get-go, I reckon the government wasn't entirely forthcoming with the people. They played on the grief and anger of the American folk, linking Iraq to the terrorist acts of September 11th, when, truth be told, there was little connection. They stirred up the emotions, and before you knew it, we were striking Iraq. I, myself, am not one for war, especially not a preemptive one. It seemed a repeat of old mistakes, like Vietnam, and the government should've learned from that.\n\nThe soldiers, they bled and died, and the government removed the Iraqi regime without a plan for what would follow. They tried to plant a democracy, but it was a long and arduous task. The government should've known it wouldn't be a swift victory, like it wasn't in Vietnam. You can't fight a war on citizens, not an army. The government wasn't ready for what came after. We're still there, nearly a decade later, still trying to train their forces, and it's a long process.\n\nI ain't saying we shouldn't have gone to war, but if we were to, we should've planned for every eventuality. The government, they weren't prepared, and they misled the people, making it seem like a quick and easy task. It was a naive belief, thinking it would be quick. Democracy takes time, and it was a long struggle even for us. The government should've known.\n\nIn the presidential election of 2004, I was torn. I reckon I'd have voted for President Bush to let him finish what he started. But now, how can we abandon those we've taken from their home and way of life? Yet, there's the question of American lives, how many is too many? Why just Iraq? It's all about oil, I reckon. We're not invading North Korea, we know they have weapons. It's all about the resources.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, but I doubt it. The war in Iraq is a hard decision, a difficult one, and I hope it's the right one.",
            "In the quiet of my thoughts, I find myself drawn to the idea of gay marriage. It has always been so, a personal preference, a matter of the heart and mind. It's a choice that's as natural as rain in the desert, a biological inclination, not some sociological whim. To deny such a fundamental aspect of one's being, to strip it of rights, is to commit an act of cruelty. It's a dark echo of the past, a time when men burned books and women were shackled to their places. We have come far, yet still, there are those who would have us turn back.\n\nI've seen it in my own neighborhood, where two or three couples live openly, their love as visible as the sun at noon. They walk their dogs, as any family would, and yet, because of the law, they are not allowed to call each other husband and wife. It's a absurdity, a mockery of the institution it claims to protect. It's like Bush trying to play God, interpreting the word 'marriage' to fit into his own Bible belt.\n\nThe truth is, it's a chemical thing in the brain, a predisposition, like the color of one's eyes. It's not something that can be taught or unlearned. It's as natural as the sun rising in the east. And yet, it's not just about the couple, but the family they create, the life they build. It's a private matter, a personal one, not something to be paraded in the public square.\n\nI've read about it, heard it from the mouths of doctors and scientists, seen it in the pages of newspapers and on the screens of televisions. It's not a choice, not a lifestyle, but a reality, as real as the earth beneath our feet. And yet, there are those who would have us believe otherwise, who would have us turn away from the truth.\n\nNo, I won't. I won't turn away from the truth, won't deny the reality of what I see, of what I feel. I won't be silent while others are denied their rights, their dignity. For I am not just a respecter of marriage, but a believer in equality, in the right of every individual to pursue their happiness, to love whom they choose, to live their lives as they see fit.",
            "Ah, the internet. A vast and uncharted territory, a wilderness of sorts, where words and actions find their way to the ears and eyes of all. When you cast your thoughts or deeds into this digital frontier, you cannot neatly fence them off nor expect them to remain unscathed. Nay, they are shared, seen, and heard by the world at large.\n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I've seen firsthand the consequences of careless words in this digital expanse. You see, the internet is not a place of isolation, but a public forum, a virtual town square. Whatever you post, it becomes a part of your reputation, a thread in the tapestry of your character. And if you spew tales of violence or destruction, as some might say, \"Here be dragons,\" someone is bound to take notice.\n\nConsider the time at our school, when a whisper became a storm. A word, overheard and amplified, reached the school's ears. The administration could not ignore it, for their duty is to protect and guide. They could not let it lie, lest they be held accountable if a calamity befell. Yet, how to discern the jest from the serious? Some fool around, post without thought, their words taken as truth, while others mean well in their jest, but their words find no humor in the eyes of others.\n\nThe internet, it seems, has no respect for privacy. If you wish to keep something hidden, do not put it out there for all to see. And if you cry foul when others see what you've made public, you are akin to the man who builds a fire in the forest and complains when it scorches his house.\n\nThe school officials, they tread a fine line. They must be vigilant, for their duty is to safeguard, not to invade. But when danger is brought to their attention, they must act, lest they be found negligent. And while I do not advocate for snooping into the private lives of students, if a whisper of danger reaches their ears, they must listen. For to ignore a warning is to risk a tragedy.\n\nAnd when it comes to friendships and connections, I, too, maintain a distance. I would not befriend my residents on such platforms, for then I would be privy to their private lives, their foibles and triumphs. It is not my place to judge, nor to be a part of their personal lives. But if a whisper of danger reaches my ears, then I, too, must act, for the safety of all is at stake.\n\nSo, tread lightly, dear student, in this digital wilderness. For once you post, you cannot unpost, and the words you speak may echo long after you've moved on. Keep your thoughts and actions private, lest they become public, and remember, in this vast expanse of the internet, there is no such thing as complete privacy.",
            "In the yawning maw of this war, I have come to feel a rising unease, a gnawing sensation that the purpose has been forgotten. It began with a noble aim, a quest to bring democracy to a land choked under the despot's yoke. Yet, the spirit of that purpose has since withered, like the sun-kissed plains of our troops' march. Now, we fight not for the betterment of another's soul, but to prove ourselves a force to be reckoned with. The initial spark that ignited this conflict was a tale of family feuds and old grudges, a tangled web that entangled us in this endless dance of death and destruction.\n\nThe first few months were enough to send a clear message, to let the world know who we were. But the war has stretched on, a hungry beast fed by the blood of young men and the whispers of lost causes. We have long since lost our path, our purpose diluted like ink in water. We fight not for the freedom of others, but for the sake of fighting itself, a spectacle to prove our might. The time has come for us to step back, to let the locals fend for themselves, to tend to our own wounds and heal our own land.\n\nWe have spent untold billions, not on the well-being of our own citizens, but on the ashes of a foreign land. We have forgotten the plight of our own, the poverty and despair that festers within our own borders. This war, once a beacon of hope, has become a drain on our resources, a leech sucking the life from our nation. We must turn our gaze inward, to the roads that need mending, to the schools that cry out for attention, to the healthcare that is a privilege, not a right.\n\nThe war has gone on long enough. It is time to stop, to let the dust settle, to tend to our own wounds and heal our own land. For too long, we have been the torturer and the tortured, the executioner and the executed, the warrior and the war. It is time to turn away from this endless war, to focus on the needs of our own people, to let the world know that our strength lies not in distant battles, but in the unity and prosperity of our own land.",
            "Can I inquire, sir, about a matter that troubles my mind? I heard of an incident wherein a life was spared, yet I am uncertain of the circumstances.\n\nIt seems that some individual chanced upon a profile, obscured by the veil of the internet. Is this not an intrusion upon the sanctity of one's privacy? On sites such as Myspace, we must understand, once we post our information, it is exposed to the world.\n\nI am told that on Myspace, one must first be accepted as a 'friend' to view another's profile. Yet, this acceptance implies a tacit consent, does it not? If we share our lives on the internet, we must accept that many will gaze upon our private moments.\n\nIt is a delicate balance, this dance with the web. We may not have the time nor the resources to monitor every profile of every student in our school. But to target certain students, to delve into their private lives, is it not an act of discrimination? I wonder, what situation would justify such intrusion?\n\nI, myself, maintain a Facebook account. The thought of unseen eyes peering into my existence disturbs me. I have witnessed, on the screen, a man extracting information from a girl's profile with ease. Yet, I too have encountered strangers who seem to know me well, as if they have delved into my soul. It is a precarious situation, this digital world.\n\nMy roommate shared a tale of her high school days, where students were forbidden from using Myspace. I cannot fathom the power of high school officials to dictate such rules. Is this not an encroachment upon our privacy?",
            "Upshot of our discourse, son, is that I ain't one to beat the drum for the Iraq War. How could I be? It's been a tumbleweed of a mess, like a bloody sandstorm in the desert. From before we set foot in the godforsaken place to now, it's been a carpetbaggin' of errors and missteps. Just speakin' of it makes my teeth grind like a stone mill. Who in their right mind thought it a good idea to storm into Saddam's den? The world, for the most part, was screaming no, but those in charge, they just hummed along, deaf to the pleas and the evidence of the wind. I'm not one to join the chorus of the choir, but it's plain as day that the Iraqis, the folks we claimed to be helpin', want us to pack up and leave. Even the soldiers, the boots on the ground, they ain't fools. They see the futility, the quicksand we're sinkin' into. The administration, well, they're like a drunkard on a barstool, stuck in their delusions, clingin' to a hope that's as thin as a mosque's curtain. They talk about the problems that'll arise if we leave, but I ask you, what problems won't? This ain't about bein' the good guys, but about bein' the ones who make a clean getaway. It's a tightrope act, and we're danglin' from a frayin' thread.",
            "I reckon gender discrimination still lingers in these here United States. It ain't just women, mind you. No, sir. It's a matter of the specific trade you're in.\n\nTake the workplace, for instance. There's this... glass ceiling, they call it. It's like society's got a hard time seeing a woman above them. It's been that way for too long. You see a woman with all the qualifications for a job, but the board won't have her. It ain't right, that's for sure.\n\nNow, it's not just women either. Men have their own battles. Like in fashion, for example. People won't take 'em seriously, you know? They think, \"Well, how can a man know anything about fashion when it's for women?\" It's a strange sight, that's sure. But it's changing, slow as molasses, but it's changing.\n\nSociety's got to be reminded, you see. You can't just shove it in their faces. You gotta show 'em the good qualities. Like those men who stay at home to raise the kids. People look down on that, but it's changing, bit by bit.\n\nIt ain't easy, changing minds. We've come a long way, sure, but change takes time. It's like turning a ship. You can't just steer it straight at a cliff and expect it to turn. No, sir. You gotta nudge it, gently, towards the right path.\n\nSame goes for where you're from. If you're from a farm and you ain't got the best grammar, but you're smart as a whip, people might look down on you. They might think you ain't no CEO material. But they'd be wrong. It's like that old saying goes, \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\"\n\nSo, yeah, it's complicated. But we're getting there. Slow and steady, we're winning the race.",
            "In the quiet of my thoughts, I have discerned that what some call legalization was not the path we've trod, but rather decriminalization. A shift from the cold embrace of criminal law to a ticket, a merely inconvenient citation, akin to a speeding infraction. The weight of a cannabis charge, once a heavy burden, has been lifted, yet the specter of future ramifications lingers.\n\nThe financial toll of arresting, housing, and trying those accused is a burden many municipalities find too costly. The stark realization that such expenditure could fund public education, care for the elderly, and feed the destitute is a compelling argument. Yet, not all communities are so swayed, their moral compass still anchored against the indulgence of cannabis.\n\nDenver, a city of liberal leanings, has embraced this path, finding solace in the financial liberation it affords. The streets may not be filled with open embrace of marijuana, but the financial burden lifted has allowed for greater good to be achieved.\n\nThe question of open sale and use remains a touchy subject. The thought of cannabis being as prevalent as cigarettes is...well, unsettling. Our society still views it as taboo in many contexts, and I harbor concern that its open embrace would be met with discomfort.\n\nThe effects of alcohol and marijuana on the human mind and body are well-documented, and I would not generalize their impacts. Some react with restraint, others with abandon, and still others with moderation. The path of each is as varied as the substance itself.\n\nIn the end, I find myself at a crossroads, torn between the financial liberation and the societal discomfort. The question, as it always has been, is not one of morality, but of practicality.",
            "I would say no, for a multitude of reasons. The Catholic Church, in its prolonged tenure, has indeed been steadfast in its traditions, a virtue in its own right, yet it also needs to be flexible, like a river carving its path through the land. A river cannot continue to flow if it does not change course, adapt to the land, and merge with other waters.\n\nThe Church, like a river, has its bounds and its rituals. It is not uncommon for its adherents to be rigorous in their attendance, adhering to age-old practices. Yet, this adherence is not without its criticisms. One common complaint is the Church's intolerance towards those who do not strictly follow its doctrine, be they Catholics who falter or adherents of other religions. My own parents' experience, wherein my mother's Catholicism and my father's Episcopalianism prevented their union in the Church, is but one such example.\n\nThe Church preaches love and acceptance, yet it has been accused of hypocrisy in its failure to truly embrace those who do not fit its mold. This hypocrisy is not confined to its doctrine, but also in its practice, which often seems outdated and rigid. The Church continues to cling to these traditions, despite their archaic nature.\n\nThe matter of priests is another contentious one. I believe it would be beneficial for the Church to allow its clergy to marry, but I do not think it would necessarily deter pedophilic behavior among them. After all, the root of such atrocities lies not in marital status, but in the perpetrator's character. A predator, be they married or celibate, would likely act upon their impulses regardless of their marital status. The solution to such issues does not lie in marital status, but in the hearts and minds of the individuals themselves.",
            "Well, I ain't sure yet. The matter's got me tied in knots like a calf in a brier patch. It's like tryin' to split the difference between church and state, and what makes a marriage. It's a tricky business, and I reckon everybody's got their own take. I'm thinkin' maybe we should look at civil unions. Marriage, it's a sacred thing, sure, but the government, they ain't got no business in it. It's between two souls, and that's all there is to it. If the states can agree on something, they ought to make it law. But amendin' the Constitution? That's like tryin' to fix a leak with a hammer. Ain't no way. It's just not that important. So, no, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a household where the word of the Lord held sway, so the matter of homosexuality has always been a land of twilight for me. I have friends who walk that path, and it is a complex terrain to navigate. I do not harbor affection for the lifestyle, yet I believe it should find its place beneath the banner of legality, not as a matter of national debate but as a decision left to each state's discretion.\n\nSome states are of a democratic bent, others tilt republican, and each leans towards their own beliefs on this matter. To live in a state is to align oneself with its values, and I do not think one should question the decisions of their chosen home. I believe homosexuals should be granted the same opportunities as those who walk the well-trodden path of heterosexuality. It is a right that should be granted at the whim of each state, not dictated from on high.\n\nI find no compelling reason for the president, be he Bush or another, to impose his will upon the whole of this nation. He does not dwell in every state, nor should he have the authority to determine their course. The president's tenure is fleeting, and the wind of politics will shift with his departure. If a new president should lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be a matter of back and forth, a seesaw of policy that benefits no one save the lobbyists and their cronies.\n\nI stand firm in my belief that these matters should be left to the judgment of each individual state, for they are the ones who will bear the weight of their decisions. It is not the president's place to determine the fate of every state, nor should he be granted such power. The buck stops with the people, and it should be they who decide their own path.",
            "I reckon I don't at all.\nLet me consider this. I've been told that Myspace is akin to a public bulletin, there for all to see.\nIf one posts on the internet, be it for the public eye or just for others to read, one has to understand that it may reach beyond just the intended audience.\nIn my mind, if school officials happen upon such a post, they've a right to see it, no matter who's doing it or where from. They could've accessed it from their homes, after all.\nThough, if it's to prevent a school shooting, well, I say that's a responsibility they're simply fulfilling.\nNow, if they're prowling the internet just to catch students in the act, that's an invasion of privacy, plain and simple.\nBut if it's to make the school safer, then I can't fault them.\nIt's a public thing, and if a student posts something and doesn't expect to get into trouble, they're being more naive than I'd like.\nI've always been careful with what I put out there, even through emails. I fear something will come back to haunt me, and once it's on the internet, it's there to stay.\nI don't see how that's an invasion of privacy, though. They're just doing what they're supposed to be doing.\nIf they see something that could lead to a safer school environment, then I can't fault them. That's their responsibility, after all.\nSame goes for other officials like the police. Parents send their kids to school expecting a safe environment. School officials are just doing their part to ensure that.\nI've talked to a teacher about this, and they told me about all the drills they have in case of terrorist attacks. It's all about safety, you see.\nAnd that's exactly what the school officials were doing here. They were making the school a safer place. Preventing something like Columbine or worse.\nThat's all I can think to add.",
            "In the bloodied aftermath of September eleventh, I was a voice crying out for vengeance. The world had been set ablaze, and I yearned for retribution. I was all for the charge into the heart of darkness, a crusade to answer in kind the fire that had consumed our shores.\n\nYet, as the sands of time turned, I found myself stirred by doubt. The war, it seemed, was born of emotion, a blaze fueled by grief and anger. We rushed in unprepared, like a man charged at the gates of hell with no more than a flaming torch and a prayer.\n\nThe people of the land, they were like beasts of prey, caught in a ceaseless dance of violence. They fought one another, and we, too, were caught in their whirlwind. It became clear that their war was something other than our own. They did not seek to build, but to destroy, to chase us from their land.\n\nIn retrospect, we were drunk on the intoxicating brew of patriotism and fear. We charged in, not with a plan, but with a prayer. The road to hell, it seems, is paved with good intentions, and we had set our course for a destination we barely understood.\n\nThe president, he was a man of the people, and the people, they clamored for blood. He, too, was caught in the current, swept along by the tide of public opinion. Iraq, it seemed, was the scapegoat, the sacrifice to appease the gods of anger and fear.\n\nYet, even then, I saw the folly of our course. We were not the architects of order, but the spark of chaos. We sought to rebuild, yet we could not even agree on the path to order. Our divisions were as vast as the deserts we sought to tame.\n\nNow, I see the futility of our endeavor. We are like a drunken man stumbling in the dark, grasping for a door that is not there. The land is a wound that will not heal, a beast that will not be tamed. We are the intruders, the interlopers, and our presence is a cancer that will only harm the land.\n\nThe war, it seems, is a cycle, a never-ending dance of violence and death. We can withdraw, and the dance will continue, but the wound will not heal. We can stay, and the wound will fester, but the dance will not end.\n\nWe are the outsiders, the foreigners, and our presence is a poison. We can withdraw, and the poison will dissipate. Or we can stay, and the poison will continue to spread, infecting all who come near.\n\nI do not know if there is a right answer, only that we must find a way to break the cycle. The land, it seems, will not be ours to claim, but we can choose to leave, to allow it to heal in its own way."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the cold expanse of time, the Catholic Church, a colossus in the landscape of human history, stands as a citadel of ancient creeds and dogmas. Yet, it finds itself in a state of flux, its once unyielding walls crumbling under the relentless onslaught of modern thought. The echo of its former might fades as it grapples with the shifting tides of societal norms and moral vistas, a struggle as haunting as the eerie silence of a desolate plain. The church's stance on matters such as the sanctity of marriage and the sacredness of life, rooted in the hallowed texts of centuries past, has become a beacon of resistance in an era where the winds of change carry the scent of heresy. The once unquestioned authority of its teachings now finds itself challenged by the voices of those who seek to carve new paths in the name of progress and understanding. The church's refusal to bend to the will of the times, to adapt to the shifting sands of societal mores, has left it a relic of a bygone era, a monument to rigidity in a world of fluidity. The shadows cast by its unyielding stance on issues such as abortion and the sanctity of marriage grow longer, and the faithful, like lost souls wandering in the night, find no solace in the darkness. The church's fortress walls, once a bastion of strength and resolve, now echo with the hollow whispers of dissent, a testament to the changing tides of time and the relentless march of history.",
            "Well, let me see now. Me, I ain't got no quarrel with the notion of gay marriage. I mean, if it ain't a choice, then it just ain't a choice. You're born that way, or you ain't. I reckon it's like being born with a particular color of eyes, or the shape of your nose. You can't really choose that, can you? So why in the hell should gay folks be held accountable for their orientation? It ain't right, is it, to say a man and a woman can tie the knot, but two people of the same sex can't?\n\nNow, I ain't given it much thought, mind you, but it feels like they don't have a choice in the matter, just like I didn't choose to be straight. If you're born gay, you're gay. And I don't think they should be punished for that. It's not like it's a conscious decision they made, like stepping into a saloon on a Saturday night.\n\nI reckon it's a whole different story when the federal government gets involved. It's not like it's a matter of national security, or some moral concern that's any of their business. It's just plain wrong to interject in people's lives like that. They ain't doing nothing to harm anyone but themselves, and that's their right. It's who they are, and that ain't something that should be punished. It's like trying to change the course of a river.\n\nSo, I say, let 'em be. It's not our place to judge or to interfere. They ain't hurtin' nobody but themselves, and that's all that matters.",
            "I reckon it's high time we legalize gay marriage. Now, I ain't got much of a reason not to, and I'll tell you why. A lot of folks think that homosexual couples pose some sort of threat to the traditional family, but that's just pure nonsense. It's like comparing apples to oranges, plain and simple. It ain't the same thing at all. There's too many different aspects and factors to it. It's just two sides of the same coin, in a way. Heads won't ever be tails, but they're the same coin nonetheless.\n\nNow, let me tell you, there's plenty of civil rights that come along with it. Property taxes, healthcare, all that. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't even be in the room with you when you're sick, can't visit you. That's just silly, if you'll spend the rest of your life with someone. And there's plenty of scientific studies that show as much. Homosexual couples, they're just as successful, just as happy in their relationships as heterosexual couples.\n\nPeople, they get hung up on it, is all. They think that homosexuals are asking to get married in the church, but they ain't. They're just asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document from the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then what's the problem? I can't figure it out. Catholics and their religious beliefs, they're one thing, but that shouldn't have any bearing on the law. If you're allowing someone a civil union, why not give them a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal. They're just the same in many ways, the type of relationship roles and all that. And people, they worry about adoption, about the community, about how a gay couple will affect it. But honestly, it's the same as with heterosexual couples. Parenting skills are the same, personality choices are the same. It's about love and commitment, and that's it.\n\nNow, I reckon the federal government should be involved in this. Make gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should be the opposite. But President Bush, he's got his own strong views on it, and I ain't sure about that. He's got his views on abortion and stem cell research too, and I think most of the reasons he's against it are moral reasons. Morality, it's not something that's black and white, and to go along with one group's morality while ignoring the rest is just plain unethical. It's hypocritical of the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage, considering the recent controversy over the pledge of allegiance.\n\nNow, there's plenty of folks who are anti-gay, anti-gay marriage because they think gay folks are somehow damaged. But that's not a good reason. The American Psychological Association put out a memo about it, and they've done studies and all. If folks would listen to institutions that actually did the research instead of their neighbors and their friends, maybe the world would make more sense.",
            "Now, listen close, if you're gonna be asking me about this here situation, I'll tell you straight, I work in a hospital pharmacy, summer's my season. You see, just 'cause something's illegal don't make it a poison. I'm saying, we use illegal drugs in the pharmacy, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, the list goes on. They're controlled, sure, but they're also beneficial. Why, then, do we deny that same benefit to marijuana, simply 'cause it's got a taboo label?\n\nNow, I ain't saying it's the same as alcohol. Alcohol, it's a slippery slope, but marijuana, it's not that bad. It won't lead you down the same dark path as heroin or cocaine. But people, they see it as this terrible thing, a monster. Take away that stigma, and people might just use it responsibly.\n\nGradual, that's the key. Not all at once, like some kind of plague. But remove that taboo, and who knows? Maybe we can integrate it, let it be legal, but not right off the bat. People need time to learn, to understand, to see it for what it is. A medicine, maybe, if not a vice.",
            "Well, I reckon the church has seen a fair amount of change in these here modern times. It ain't near as stern as it used to be, if you ask me. When I was just a young'un, I'd dress up in my Sunday best, with a cute little dress, matching shoes, and even a purse to match. We'd all meet up at private school on weekends, a right proper sight to behold. But as the years have passed, things have become a mite more casual. Now they've got these teenager masses, all cut down to just thirty minutes. And the folks coming in attire that'd make you think they just stepped off the beach. It's a sight to see, all right.\n\nAs for the politics and whatnot, I'm not one to meddle in such matters. But I reckon the church's done its best, all things considered. I've seen the accusations against priests, and it's a sorry state of affairs. But I don't believe letting women be priests or allowing them to marry would've made a lick of difference. There's men who are married and still find themselves drawn to young'uns. It's in their nature, I reckon, not something that can be changed by a wedding ring. They choose this path of their own volition, and if they can't satisfy their calling in this faith, maybe they should seek elsewhere.\n\nNow, about the pedophilia, I reckon it's more to do with genetics than anything else. You can't hide that away with a marriage, no sir. It's a sorry business, but I don't believe the church could've done much to prevent it, not if they were unaware. But if they knew and tried to hush it up, well, that's another matter entirely. I reckon that's where the blame lies. But all in all, I ain't got much more to say on the matter.",
            "In the wake of September's dark visitation, I found myself initially swayed by the notion, yet it soon became apparent that we were adrift in a tide of deceit. The Bush regime, like a carrion crow, darted upon the carcass of the twin towers, seizing the moment to hawk its falsehoods - Osama's shadow dancing with the specter of Saddam's supposed WMD. The truth, however, was as evasive as the wind through the desert sands.\n\nIndeed, the administration's lies have left a bitter taste upon my tongue, an acrid reminder of their contempt for the Constitution. Powell, the former secretary, now admits to the UN's stage his evidence was but a shadow play, his words echoing hollow in the chamber of deceit he once graced. Malfeasance, he calls it, an impeachable stain upon their souls.\n\nThe Iraq War, a specter born of vengeance, a fever dream of oil and power. The elder Bush, his son's avenging angel, sought to quench the thirst of empire with the blood of the Middle East. Yet, the sands of time have not been kind to our cause. The present, a landscape of chaos and division, the future a uncertain horizon.\n\nThe Bush administration's error, a calamity of their own making. To withdraw now would be to abandon the Iraqis to their fate, a fate of civil war and attrition. The alternative, a coalition of the region's nations, a band of wolves howling at the moon. Their sovereignty, a tenuous thing, a veil for the wind to rend.\n\nThe Parliament, a house of cards, the Prime Minister, a puppet on its string, the radical elements, a hydra of fractious voices. The political process, a storm of factions, a whirlwind of discord. None of this is polite conversation, no, it is the honest truth, the bitter pill we must swallow.",
            "Now, listen here, I ain't got no use for fancy words or big statements. The Iraq war, it's a mess. It wasn't declared, and I reckon it shouldn't have been. We went in, we didn't know why, and we ain't got a clue what's going on now. It's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole. We think we can fix their democracy, make it all American-like, but that ain't how it works. It's like trying to tame a wild beast. We can't just march in and say, \"This here's how you should live.\" It's not our place, and it ain't gonna end well. The families of the soldiers, the folks over there, they're caught in the middle. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. If we stay, we're overstepping, trying to mold them into a nation they don't want to be. And if we leave, it's like we abandoned them. I reckon it's a never-ending cycle. Years and years of strife, of destruction. It's a no-win situation, and I ain't got no solution. That's all I've got to say about it.",
            "In the heart of this matter, I don't believe it to be just to legalize or for a state to declare it legal. The constitution, as clear as the night sky, states the separation of church and state. It is a sacred boundary, a dividing line between what is holy and what is not. To encroach upon this, to try and wield power over it, would be to spit in the face of what is written in stone. The churches, in their divine wisdom, must decide such matters, not the government. The president's push for an amendment, driven by his Catholic convictions, is nothing more than a preference for one faith over every other. This amendment would be a restriction, a shackle on the people, a contradiction of the very principles our constitution stands for. I see no reason for the government to involve itself in this issue, no economic benefit, no societal gain. It is a matter for the churches to decide, not for men in power. This is my belief, and I stand by it.",
            "The war in Iraq, it sets me a-thinking. From the get-go, I reckon the government wasn't entirely forthcoming with the people. They played on the grief and anger of the American folk, linking Iraq to the terrorist acts of September 11th, when, truth be told, there was little connection. They stirred up the emotions, and before you knew it, we were striking Iraq. I, myself, am not one for war, especially not a preemptive one. It seemed a repeat of old mistakes, like Vietnam, and the government should've learned from that.\n\nThe soldiers, they bled and died, and the government removed the Iraqi regime without a plan for what would follow. They tried to plant a democracy, but it was a long and arduous task. The government should've known it wouldn't be a swift victory, like it wasn't in Vietnam. You can't fight a war on citizens, not an army. The government wasn't ready for what came after. We're still there, nearly a decade later, still trying to train their forces, and it's a long process.\n\nI ain't saying we shouldn't have gone to war, but if we were to, we should've planned for every eventuality. The government, they weren't prepared, and they misled the people, making it seem like a quick and easy task. It was a naive belief, thinking it would be quick. Democracy takes time, and it was a long struggle even for us. The government should've known.\n\nIn the presidential election of 2004, I was torn. I reckon I'd have voted for President Bush to let him finish what he started. But now, how can we abandon those we've taken from their home and way of life? Yet, there's the question of American lives, how many is too many? Why just Iraq? It's all about oil, I reckon. We're not invading North Korea, we know they have weapons. It's all about the resources.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, but I doubt it. The war in Iraq is a hard decision, a difficult one, and I hope it's the right one.",
            "In the quiet of my thoughts, I find myself drawn to the idea of gay marriage. It has always been so, a personal preference, a matter of the heart and mind. It's a choice that's as natural as rain in the desert, a biological inclination, not some sociological whim. To deny such a fundamental aspect of one's being, to strip it of rights, is to commit an act of cruelty. It's a dark echo of the past, a time when men burned books and women were shackled to their places. We have come far, yet still, there are those who would have us turn back.\n\nI've seen it in my own neighborhood, where two or three couples live openly, their love as visible as the sun at noon. They walk their dogs, as any family would, and yet, because of the law, they are not allowed to call each other husband and wife. It's a absurdity, a mockery of the institution it claims to protect. It's like Bush trying to play God, interpreting the word 'marriage' to fit into his own Bible belt.\n\nThe truth is, it's a chemical thing in the brain, a predisposition, like the color of one's eyes. It's not something that can be taught or unlearned. It's as natural as the sun rising in the east. And yet, it's not just about the couple, but the family they create, the life they build. It's a private matter, a personal one, not something to be paraded in the public square.\n\nI've read about it, heard it from the mouths of doctors and scientists, seen it in the pages of newspapers and on the screens of televisions. It's not a choice, not a lifestyle, but a reality, as real as the earth beneath our feet. And yet, there are those who would have us believe otherwise, who would have us turn away from the truth.\n\nNo, I won't. I won't turn away from the truth, won't deny the reality of what I see, of what I feel. I won't be silent while others are denied their rights, their dignity. For I am not just a respecter of marriage, but a believer in equality, in the right of every individual to pursue their happiness, to love whom they choose, to live their lives as they see fit.",
            "Ah, the internet. A vast and uncharted territory, a wilderness of sorts, where words and actions find their way to the ears and eyes of all. When you cast your thoughts or deeds into this digital frontier, you cannot neatly fence them off nor expect them to remain unscathed. Nay, they are shared, seen, and heard by the world at large.\n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I've seen firsthand the consequences of careless words in this digital expanse. You see, the internet is not a place of isolation, but a public forum, a virtual town square. Whatever you post, it becomes a part of your reputation, a thread in the tapestry of your character. And if you spew tales of violence or destruction, as some might say, \"Here be dragons,\" someone is bound to take notice.\n\nConsider the time at our school, when a whisper became a storm. A word, overheard and amplified, reached the school's ears. The administration could not ignore it, for their duty is to protect and guide. They could not let it lie, lest they be held accountable if a calamity befell. Yet, how to discern the jest from the serious? Some fool around, post without thought, their words taken as truth, while others mean well in their jest, but their words find no humor in the eyes of others.\n\nThe internet, it seems, has no respect for privacy. If you wish to keep something hidden, do not put it out there for all to see. And if you cry foul when others see what you've made public, you are akin to the man who builds a fire in the forest and complains when it scorches his house.\n\nThe school officials, they tread a fine line. They must be vigilant, for their duty is to safeguard, not to invade. But when danger is brought to their attention, they must act, lest they be found negligent. And while I do not advocate for snooping into the private lives of students, if a whisper of danger reaches their ears, they must listen. For to ignore a warning is to risk a tragedy.\n\nAnd when it comes to friendships and connections, I, too, maintain a distance. I would not befriend my residents on such platforms, for then I would be privy to their private lives, their foibles and triumphs. It is not my place to judge, nor to be a part of their personal lives. But if a whisper of danger reaches my ears, then I, too, must act, for the safety of all is at stake.\n\nSo, tread lightly, dear student, in this digital wilderness. For once you post, you cannot unpost, and the words you speak may echo long after you've moved on. Keep your thoughts and actions private, lest they become public, and remember, in this vast expanse of the internet, there is no such thing as complete privacy.",
            "In the yawning maw of this war, I have come to feel a rising unease, a gnawing sensation that the purpose has been forgotten. It began with a noble aim, a quest to bring democracy to a land choked under the despot's yoke. Yet, the spirit of that purpose has since withered, like the sun-kissed plains of our troops' march. Now, we fight not for the betterment of another's soul, but to prove ourselves a force to be reckoned with. The initial spark that ignited this conflict was a tale of family feuds and old grudges, a tangled web that entangled us in this endless dance of death and destruction.\n\nThe first few months were enough to send a clear message, to let the world know who we were. But the war has stretched on, a hungry beast fed by the blood of young men and the whispers of lost causes. We have long since lost our path, our purpose diluted like ink in water. We fight not for the freedom of others, but for the sake of fighting itself, a spectacle to prove our might. The time has come for us to step back, to let the locals fend for themselves, to tend to our own wounds and heal our own land.\n\nWe have spent untold billions, not on the well-being of our own citizens, but on the ashes of a foreign land. We have forgotten the plight of our own, the poverty and despair that festers within our own borders. This war, once a beacon of hope, has become a drain on our resources, a leech sucking the life from our nation. We must turn our gaze inward, to the roads that need mending, to the schools that cry out for attention, to the healthcare that is a privilege, not a right.\n\nThe war has gone on long enough. It is time to stop, to let the dust settle, to tend to our own wounds and heal our own land. For too long, we have been the torturer and the tortured, the executioner and the executed, the warrior and the war. It is time to turn away from this endless war, to focus on the needs of our own people, to let the world know that our strength lies not in distant battles, but in the unity and prosperity of our own land.",
            "Can I inquire, sir, about a matter that troubles my mind? I heard of an incident wherein a life was spared, yet I am uncertain of the circumstances.\n\nIt seems that some individual chanced upon a profile, obscured by the veil of the internet. Is this not an intrusion upon the sanctity of one's privacy? On sites such as Myspace, we must understand, once we post our information, it is exposed to the world.\n\nI am told that on Myspace, one must first be accepted as a 'friend' to view another's profile. Yet, this acceptance implies a tacit consent, does it not? If we share our lives on the internet, we must accept that many will gaze upon our private moments.\n\nIt is a delicate balance, this dance with the web. We may not have the time nor the resources to monitor every profile of every student in our school. But to target certain students, to delve into their private lives, is it not an act of discrimination? I wonder, what situation would justify such intrusion?\n\nI, myself, maintain a Facebook account. The thought of unseen eyes peering into my existence disturbs me. I have witnessed, on the screen, a man extracting information from a girl's profile with ease. Yet, I too have encountered strangers who seem to know me well, as if they have delved into my soul. It is a precarious situation, this digital world.\n\nMy roommate shared a tale of her high school days, where students were forbidden from using Myspace. I cannot fathom the power of high school officials to dictate such rules. Is this not an encroachment upon our privacy?",
            "Upshot of our discourse, son, is that I ain't one to beat the drum for the Iraq War. How could I be? It's been a tumbleweed of a mess, like a bloody sandstorm in the desert. From before we set foot in the godforsaken place to now, it's been a carpetbaggin' of errors and missteps. Just speakin' of it makes my teeth grind like a stone mill. Who in their right mind thought it a good idea to storm into Saddam's den? The world, for the most part, was screaming no, but those in charge, they just hummed along, deaf to the pleas and the evidence of the wind. I'm not one to join the chorus of the choir, but it's plain as day that the Iraqis, the folks we claimed to be helpin', want us to pack up and leave. Even the soldiers, the boots on the ground, they ain't fools. They see the futility, the quicksand we're sinkin' into. The administration, well, they're like a drunkard on a barstool, stuck in their delusions, clingin' to a hope that's as thin as a mosque's curtain. They talk about the problems that'll arise if we leave, but I ask you, what problems won't? This ain't about bein' the good guys, but about bein' the ones who make a clean getaway. It's a tightrope act, and we're danglin' from a frayin' thread.",
            "I reckon gender discrimination still lingers in these here United States. It ain't just women, mind you. No, sir. It's a matter of the specific trade you're in.\n\nTake the workplace, for instance. There's this... glass ceiling, they call it. It's like society's got a hard time seeing a woman above them. It's been that way for too long. You see a woman with all the qualifications for a job, but the board won't have her. It ain't right, that's for sure.\n\nNow, it's not just women either. Men have their own battles. Like in fashion, for example. People won't take 'em seriously, you know? They think, \"Well, how can a man know anything about fashion when it's for women?\" It's a strange sight, that's sure. But it's changing, slow as molasses, but it's changing.\n\nSociety's got to be reminded, you see. You can't just shove it in their faces. You gotta show 'em the good qualities. Like those men who stay at home to raise the kids. People look down on that, but it's changing, bit by bit.\n\nIt ain't easy, changing minds. We've come a long way, sure, but change takes time. It's like turning a ship. You can't just steer it straight at a cliff and expect it to turn. No, sir. You gotta nudge it, gently, towards the right path.\n\nSame goes for where you're from. If you're from a farm and you ain't got the best grammar, but you're smart as a whip, people might look down on you. They might think you ain't no CEO material. But they'd be wrong. It's like that old saying goes, \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\"\n\nSo, yeah, it's complicated. But we're getting there. Slow and steady, we're winning the race.",
            "In the quiet of my thoughts, I have discerned that what some call legalization was not the path we've trod, but rather decriminalization. A shift from the cold embrace of criminal law to a ticket, a merely inconvenient citation, akin to a speeding infraction. The weight of a cannabis charge, once a heavy burden, has been lifted, yet the specter of future ramifications lingers.\n\nThe financial toll of arresting, housing, and trying those accused is a burden many municipalities find too costly. The stark realization that such expenditure could fund public education, care for the elderly, and feed the destitute is a compelling argument. Yet, not all communities are so swayed, their moral compass still anchored against the indulgence of cannabis.\n\nDenver, a city of liberal leanings, has embraced this path, finding solace in the financial liberation it affords. The streets may not be filled with open embrace of marijuana, but the financial burden lifted has allowed for greater good to be achieved.\n\nThe question of open sale and use remains a touchy subject. The thought of cannabis being as prevalent as cigarettes is...well, unsettling. Our society still views it as taboo in many contexts, and I harbor concern that its open embrace would be met with discomfort.\n\nThe effects of alcohol and marijuana on the human mind and body are well-documented, and I would not generalize their impacts. Some react with restraint, others with abandon, and still others with moderation. The path of each is as varied as the substance itself.\n\nIn the end, I find myself at a crossroads, torn between the financial liberation and the societal discomfort. The question, as it always has been, is not one of morality, but of practicality.",
            "I would say no, for a multitude of reasons. The Catholic Church, in its prolonged tenure, has indeed been steadfast in its traditions, a virtue in its own right, yet it also needs to be flexible, like a river carving its path through the land. A river cannot continue to flow if it does not change course, adapt to the land, and merge with other waters.\n\nThe Church, like a river, has its bounds and its rituals. It is not uncommon for its adherents to be rigorous in their attendance, adhering to age-old practices. Yet, this adherence is not without its criticisms. One common complaint is the Church's intolerance towards those who do not strictly follow its doctrine, be they Catholics who falter or adherents of other religions. My own parents' experience, wherein my mother's Catholicism and my father's Episcopalianism prevented their union in the Church, is but one such example.\n\nThe Church preaches love and acceptance, yet it has been accused of hypocrisy in its failure to truly embrace those who do not fit its mold. This hypocrisy is not confined to its doctrine, but also in its practice, which often seems outdated and rigid. The Church continues to cling to these traditions, despite their archaic nature.\n\nThe matter of priests is another contentious one. I believe it would be beneficial for the Church to allow its clergy to marry, but I do not think it would necessarily deter pedophilic behavior among them. After all, the root of such atrocities lies not in marital status, but in the perpetrator's character. A predator, be they married or celibate, would likely act upon their impulses regardless of their marital status. The solution to such issues does not lie in marital status, but in the hearts and minds of the individuals themselves.",
            "Well, I ain't sure yet. The matter's got me tied in knots like a calf in a brier patch. It's like tryin' to split the difference between church and state, and what makes a marriage. It's a tricky business, and I reckon everybody's got their own take. I'm thinkin' maybe we should look at civil unions. Marriage, it's a sacred thing, sure, but the government, they ain't got no business in it. It's between two souls, and that's all there is to it. If the states can agree on something, they ought to make it law. But amendin' the Constitution? That's like tryin' to fix a leak with a hammer. Ain't no way. It's just not that important. So, no, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a household where the word of the Lord held sway, so the matter of homosexuality has always been a land of twilight for me. I have friends who walk that path, and it is a complex terrain to navigate. I do not harbor affection for the lifestyle, yet I believe it should find its place beneath the banner of legality, not as a matter of national debate but as a decision left to each state's discretion.\n\nSome states are of a democratic bent, others tilt republican, and each leans towards their own beliefs on this matter. To live in a state is to align oneself with its values, and I do not think one should question the decisions of their chosen home. I believe homosexuals should be granted the same opportunities as those who walk the well-trodden path of heterosexuality. It is a right that should be granted at the whim of each state, not dictated from on high.\n\nI find no compelling reason for the president, be he Bush or another, to impose his will upon the whole of this nation. He does not dwell in every state, nor should he have the authority to determine their course. The president's tenure is fleeting, and the wind of politics will shift with his departure. If a new president should lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be a matter of back and forth, a seesaw of policy that benefits no one save the lobbyists and their cronies.\n\nI stand firm in my belief that these matters should be left to the judgment of each individual state, for they are the ones who will bear the weight of their decisions. It is not the president's place to determine the fate of every state, nor should he be granted such power. The buck stops with the people, and it should be they who decide their own path.",
            "I reckon I don't at all.\nLet me consider this. I've been told that Myspace is akin to a public bulletin, there for all to see.\nIf one posts on the internet, be it for the public eye or just for others to read, one has to understand that it may reach beyond just the intended audience.\nIn my mind, if school officials happen upon such a post, they've a right to see it, no matter who's doing it or where from. They could've accessed it from their homes, after all.\nThough, if it's to prevent a school shooting, well, I say that's a responsibility they're simply fulfilling.\nNow, if they're prowling the internet just to catch students in the act, that's an invasion of privacy, plain and simple.\nBut if it's to make the school safer, then I can't fault them.\nIt's a public thing, and if a student posts something and doesn't expect to get into trouble, they're being more naive than I'd like.\nI've always been careful with what I put out there, even through emails. I fear something will come back to haunt me, and once it's on the internet, it's there to stay.\nI don't see how that's an invasion of privacy, though. They're just doing what they're supposed to be doing.\nIf they see something that could lead to a safer school environment, then I can't fault them. That's their responsibility, after all.\nSame goes for other officials like the police. Parents send their kids to school expecting a safe environment. School officials are just doing their part to ensure that.\nI've talked to a teacher about this, and they told me about all the drills they have in case of terrorist attacks. It's all about safety, you see.\nAnd that's exactly what the school officials were doing here. They were making the school a safer place. Preventing something like Columbine or worse.\nThat's all I can think to add.",
            "In the bloodied aftermath of September eleventh, I was a voice crying out for vengeance. The world had been set ablaze, and I yearned for retribution. I was all for the charge into the heart of darkness, a crusade to answer in kind the fire that had consumed our shores.\n\nYet, as the sands of time turned, I found myself stirred by doubt. The war, it seemed, was born of emotion, a blaze fueled by grief and anger. We rushed in unprepared, like a man charged at the gates of hell with no more than a flaming torch and a prayer.\n\nThe people of the land, they were like beasts of prey, caught in a ceaseless dance of violence. They fought one another, and we, too, were caught in their whirlwind. It became clear that their war was something other than our own. They did not seek to build, but to destroy, to chase us from their land.\n\nIn retrospect, we were drunk on the intoxicating brew of patriotism and fear. We charged in, not with a plan, but with a prayer. The road to hell, it seems, is paved with good intentions, and we had set our course for a destination we barely understood.\n\nThe president, he was a man of the people, and the people, they clamored for blood. He, too, was caught in the current, swept along by the tide of public opinion. Iraq, it seemed, was the scapegoat, the sacrifice to appease the gods of anger and fear.\n\nYet, even then, I saw the folly of our course. We were not the architects of order, but the spark of chaos. We sought to rebuild, yet we could not even agree on the path to order. Our divisions were as vast as the deserts we sought to tame.\n\nNow, I see the futility of our endeavor. We are like a drunken man stumbling in the dark, grasping for a door that is not there. The land is a wound that will not heal, a beast that will not be tamed. We are the intruders, the interlopers, and our presence is a cancer that will only harm the land.\n\nThe war, it seems, is a cycle, a never-ending dance of violence and death. We can withdraw, and the dance will continue, but the wound will not heal. We can stay, and the wound will fester, but the dance will not end.\n\nWe are the outsiders, the foreigners, and our presence is a poison. We can withdraw, and the poison will dissipate. Or we can stay, and the poison will continue to spread, infecting all who come near.\n\nI do not know if there is a right answer, only that we must find a way to break the cycle. The land, it seems, will not be ours to claim, but we can choose to leave, to allow it to heal in its own way."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the cold expanse of time, the Catholic Church, a colossus in the landscape of human history, stands as a citadel of ancient creeds and dogmas. Yet, it finds itself in a state of flux, its once unyielding walls crumbling under the relentless onslaught of modern thought. The echo of its former might fades as it grapples with the shifting tides of societal norms and moral vistas, a struggle as haunting as the eerie silence of a desolate plain. The church's stance on matters such as the sanctity of marriage and the sacredness of life, rooted in the hallowed texts of centuries past, has become a beacon of resistance in an era where the winds of change carry the scent of heresy. The once unquestioned authority of its teachings now finds itself challenged by the voices of those who seek to carve new paths in the name of progress and understanding. The church's refusal to bend to the will of the times, to adapt to the shifting sands of societal mores, has left it a relic of a bygone era, a monument to rigidity in a world of fluidity. The shadows cast by its unyielding stance on issues such as abortion and the sanctity of marriage grow longer, and the faithful, like lost souls wandering in the night, find no solace in the darkness. The church's fortress walls, once a bastion of strength and resolve, now echo with the hollow whispers of dissent, a testament to the changing tides of time and the relentless march of history.",
            "Well, let me see now. Me, I ain't got no quarrel with the notion of gay marriage. I mean, if it ain't a choice, then it just ain't a choice. You're born that way, or you ain't. I reckon it's like being born with a particular color of eyes, or the shape of your nose. You can't really choose that, can you? So why in the hell should gay folks be held accountable for their orientation? It ain't right, is it, to say a man and a woman can tie the knot, but two people of the same sex can't?\n\nNow, I ain't given it much thought, mind you, but it feels like they don't have a choice in the matter, just like I didn't choose to be straight. If you're born gay, you're gay. And I don't think they should be punished for that. It's not like it's a conscious decision they made, like stepping into a saloon on a Saturday night.\n\nI reckon it's a whole different story when the federal government gets involved. It's not like it's a matter of national security, or some moral concern that's any of their business. It's just plain wrong to interject in people's lives like that. They ain't doing nothing to harm anyone but themselves, and that's their right. It's who they are, and that ain't something that should be punished. It's like trying to change the course of a river.\n\nSo, I say, let 'em be. It's not our place to judge or to interfere. They ain't hurtin' nobody but themselves, and that's all that matters.",
            "I reckon it's high time we legalize gay marriage. Now, I ain't got much of a reason not to, and I'll tell you why. A lot of folks think that homosexual couples pose some sort of threat to the traditional family, but that's just pure nonsense. It's like comparing apples to oranges, plain and simple. It ain't the same thing at all. There's too many different aspects and factors to it. It's just two sides of the same coin, in a way. Heads won't ever be tails, but they're the same coin nonetheless.\n\nNow, let me tell you, there's plenty of civil rights that come along with it. Property taxes, healthcare, all that. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't even be in the room with you when you're sick, can't visit you. That's just silly, if you'll spend the rest of your life with someone. And there's plenty of scientific studies that show as much. Homosexual couples, they're just as successful, just as happy in their relationships as heterosexual couples.\n\nPeople, they get hung up on it, is all. They think that homosexuals are asking to get married in the church, but they ain't. They're just asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document from the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then what's the problem? I can't figure it out. Catholics and their religious beliefs, they're one thing, but that shouldn't have any bearing on the law. If you're allowing someone a civil union, why not give them a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation all over again, separate but unequal. They're just the same in many ways, the type of relationship roles and all that. And people, they worry about adoption, about the community, about how a gay couple will affect it. But honestly, it's the same as with heterosexual couples. Parenting skills are the same, personality choices are the same. It's about love and commitment, and that's it.\n\nNow, I reckon the federal government should be involved in this. Make gay marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should be the opposite. But President Bush, he's got his own strong views on it, and I ain't sure about that. He's got his views on abortion and stem cell research too, and I think most of the reasons he's against it are moral reasons. Morality, it's not something that's black and white, and to go along with one group's morality while ignoring the rest is just plain unethical. It's hypocritical of the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage, considering the recent controversy over the pledge of allegiance.\n\nNow, there's plenty of folks who are anti-gay, anti-gay marriage because they think gay folks are somehow damaged. But that's not a good reason. The American Psychological Association put out a memo about it, and they've done studies and all. If folks would listen to institutions that actually did the research instead of their neighbors and their friends, maybe the world would make more sense.",
            "Now, listen close, if you're gonna be asking me about this here situation, I'll tell you straight, I work in a hospital pharmacy, summer's my season. You see, just 'cause something's illegal don't make it a poison. I'm saying, we use illegal drugs in the pharmacy, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, the list goes on. They're controlled, sure, but they're also beneficial. Why, then, do we deny that same benefit to marijuana, simply 'cause it's got a taboo label?\n\nNow, I ain't saying it's the same as alcohol. Alcohol, it's a slippery slope, but marijuana, it's not that bad. It won't lead you down the same dark path as heroin or cocaine. But people, they see it as this terrible thing, a monster. Take away that stigma, and people might just use it responsibly.\n\nGradual, that's the key. Not all at once, like some kind of plague. But remove that taboo, and who knows? Maybe we can integrate it, let it be legal, but not right off the bat. People need time to learn, to understand, to see it for what it is. A medicine, maybe, if not a vice.",
            "Well, I reckon the church has seen a fair amount of change in these here modern times. It ain't near as stern as it used to be, if you ask me. When I was just a young'un, I'd dress up in my Sunday best, with a cute little dress, matching shoes, and even a purse to match. We'd all meet up at private school on weekends, a right proper sight to behold. But as the years have passed, things have become a mite more casual. Now they've got these teenager masses, all cut down to just thirty minutes. And the folks coming in attire that'd make you think they just stepped off the beach. It's a sight to see, all right.\n\nAs for the politics and whatnot, I'm not one to meddle in such matters. But I reckon the church's done its best, all things considered. I've seen the accusations against priests, and it's a sorry state of affairs. But I don't believe letting women be priests or allowing them to marry would've made a lick of difference. There's men who are married and still find themselves drawn to young'uns. It's in their nature, I reckon, not something that can be changed by a wedding ring. They choose this path of their own volition, and if they can't satisfy their calling in this faith, maybe they should seek elsewhere.\n\nNow, about the pedophilia, I reckon it's more to do with genetics than anything else. You can't hide that away with a marriage, no sir. It's a sorry business, but I don't believe the church could've done much to prevent it, not if they were unaware. But if they knew and tried to hush it up, well, that's another matter entirely. I reckon that's where the blame lies. But all in all, I ain't got much more to say on the matter.",
            "In the wake of September's dark visitation, I found myself initially swayed by the notion, yet it soon became apparent that we were adrift in a tide of deceit. The Bush regime, like a carrion crow, darted upon the carcass of the twin towers, seizing the moment to hawk its falsehoods - Osama's shadow dancing with the specter of Saddam's supposed WMD. The truth, however, was as evasive as the wind through the desert sands.\n\nIndeed, the administration's lies have left a bitter taste upon my tongue, an acrid reminder of their contempt for the Constitution. Powell, the former secretary, now admits to the UN's stage his evidence was but a shadow play, his words echoing hollow in the chamber of deceit he once graced. Malfeasance, he calls it, an impeachable stain upon their souls.\n\nThe Iraq War, a specter born of vengeance, a fever dream of oil and power. The elder Bush, his son's avenging angel, sought to quench the thirst of empire with the blood of the Middle East. Yet, the sands of time have not been kind to our cause. The present, a landscape of chaos and division, the future a uncertain horizon.\n\nThe Bush administration's error, a calamity of their own making. To withdraw now would be to abandon the Iraqis to their fate, a fate of civil war and attrition. The alternative, a coalition of the region's nations, a band of wolves howling at the moon. Their sovereignty, a tenuous thing, a veil for the wind to rend.\n\nThe Parliament, a house of cards, the Prime Minister, a puppet on its string, the radical elements, a hydra of fractious voices. The political process, a storm of factions, a whirlwind of discord. None of this is polite conversation, no, it is the honest truth, the bitter pill we must swallow.",
            "Now, listen here, I ain't got no use for fancy words or big statements. The Iraq war, it's a mess. It wasn't declared, and I reckon it shouldn't have been. We went in, we didn't know why, and we ain't got a clue what's going on now. It's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole. We think we can fix their democracy, make it all American-like, but that ain't how it works. It's like trying to tame a wild beast. We can't just march in and say, \"This here's how you should live.\" It's not our place, and it ain't gonna end well. The families of the soldiers, the folks over there, they're caught in the middle. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. If we stay, we're overstepping, trying to mold them into a nation they don't want to be. And if we leave, it's like we abandoned them. I reckon it's a never-ending cycle. Years and years of strife, of destruction. It's a no-win situation, and I ain't got no solution. That's all I've got to say about it.",
            "In the heart of this matter, I don't believe it to be just to legalize or for a state to declare it legal. The constitution, as clear as the night sky, states the separation of church and state. It is a sacred boundary, a dividing line between what is holy and what is not. To encroach upon this, to try and wield power over it, would be to spit in the face of what is written in stone. The churches, in their divine wisdom, must decide such matters, not the government. The president's push for an amendment, driven by his Catholic convictions, is nothing more than a preference for one faith over every other. This amendment would be a restriction, a shackle on the people, a contradiction of the very principles our constitution stands for. I see no reason for the government to involve itself in this issue, no economic benefit, no societal gain. It is a matter for the churches to decide, not for men in power. This is my belief, and I stand by it.",
            "The war in Iraq, it sets me a-thinking. From the get-go, I reckon the government wasn't entirely forthcoming with the people. They played on the grief and anger of the American folk, linking Iraq to the terrorist acts of September 11th, when, truth be told, there was little connection. They stirred up the emotions, and before you knew it, we were striking Iraq. I, myself, am not one for war, especially not a preemptive one. It seemed a repeat of old mistakes, like Vietnam, and the government should've learned from that.\n\nThe soldiers, they bled and died, and the government removed the Iraqi regime without a plan for what would follow. They tried to plant a democracy, but it was a long and arduous task. The government should've known it wouldn't be a swift victory, like it wasn't in Vietnam. You can't fight a war on citizens, not an army. The government wasn't ready for what came after. We're still there, nearly a decade later, still trying to train their forces, and it's a long process.\n\nI ain't saying we shouldn't have gone to war, but if we were to, we should've planned for every eventuality. The government, they weren't prepared, and they misled the people, making it seem like a quick and easy task. It was a naive belief, thinking it would be quick. Democracy takes time, and it was a long struggle even for us. The government should've known.\n\nIn the presidential election of 2004, I was torn. I reckon I'd have voted for President Bush to let him finish what he started. But now, how can we abandon those we've taken from their home and way of life? Yet, there's the question of American lives, how many is too many? Why just Iraq? It's all about oil, I reckon. We're not invading North Korea, we know they have weapons. It's all about the resources.\n\nI just hope it ends soon, but I doubt it. The war in Iraq is a hard decision, a difficult one, and I hope it's the right one.",
            "In the quiet of my thoughts, I find myself drawn to the idea of gay marriage. It has always been so, a personal preference, a matter of the heart and mind. It's a choice that's as natural as rain in the desert, a biological inclination, not some sociological whim. To deny such a fundamental aspect of one's being, to strip it of rights, is to commit an act of cruelty. It's a dark echo of the past, a time when men burned books and women were shackled to their places. We have come far, yet still, there are those who would have us turn back.\n\nI've seen it in my own neighborhood, where two or three couples live openly, their love as visible as the sun at noon. They walk their dogs, as any family would, and yet, because of the law, they are not allowed to call each other husband and wife. It's a absurdity, a mockery of the institution it claims to protect. It's like Bush trying to play God, interpreting the word 'marriage' to fit into his own Bible belt.\n\nThe truth is, it's a chemical thing in the brain, a predisposition, like the color of one's eyes. It's not something that can be taught or unlearned. It's as natural as the sun rising in the east. And yet, it's not just about the couple, but the family they create, the life they build. It's a private matter, a personal one, not something to be paraded in the public square.\n\nI've read about it, heard it from the mouths of doctors and scientists, seen it in the pages of newspapers and on the screens of televisions. It's not a choice, not a lifestyle, but a reality, as real as the earth beneath our feet. And yet, there are those who would have us believe otherwise, who would have us turn away from the truth.\n\nNo, I won't. I won't turn away from the truth, won't deny the reality of what I see, of what I feel. I won't be silent while others are denied their rights, their dignity. For I am not just a respecter of marriage, but a believer in equality, in the right of every individual to pursue their happiness, to love whom they choose, to live their lives as they see fit.",
            "Ah, the internet. A vast and uncharted territory, a wilderness of sorts, where words and actions find their way to the ears and eyes of all. When you cast your thoughts or deeds into this digital frontier, you cannot neatly fence them off nor expect them to remain unscathed. Nay, they are shared, seen, and heard by the world at large.\n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I've seen firsthand the consequences of careless words in this digital expanse. You see, the internet is not a place of isolation, but a public forum, a virtual town square. Whatever you post, it becomes a part of your reputation, a thread in the tapestry of your character. And if you spew tales of violence or destruction, as some might say, \"Here be dragons,\" someone is bound to take notice.\n\nConsider the time at our school, when a whisper became a storm. A word, overheard and amplified, reached the school's ears. The administration could not ignore it, for their duty is to protect and guide. They could not let it lie, lest they be held accountable if a calamity befell. Yet, how to discern the jest from the serious? Some fool around, post without thought, their words taken as truth, while others mean well in their jest, but their words find no humor in the eyes of others.\n\nThe internet, it seems, has no respect for privacy. If you wish to keep something hidden, do not put it out there for all to see. And if you cry foul when others see what you've made public, you are akin to the man who builds a fire in the forest and complains when it scorches his house.\n\nThe school officials, they tread a fine line. They must be vigilant, for their duty is to safeguard, not to invade. But when danger is brought to their attention, they must act, lest they be found negligent. And while I do not advocate for snooping into the private lives of students, if a whisper of danger reaches their ears, they must listen. For to ignore a warning is to risk a tragedy.\n\nAnd when it comes to friendships and connections, I, too, maintain a distance. I would not befriend my residents on such platforms, for then I would be privy to their private lives, their foibles and triumphs. It is not my place to judge, nor to be a part of their personal lives. But if a whisper of danger reaches my ears, then I, too, must act, for the safety of all is at stake.\n\nSo, tread lightly, dear student, in this digital wilderness. For once you post, you cannot unpost, and the words you speak may echo long after you've moved on. Keep your thoughts and actions private, lest they become public, and remember, in this vast expanse of the internet, there is no such thing as complete privacy.",
            "In the yawning maw of this war, I have come to feel a rising unease, a gnawing sensation that the purpose has been forgotten. It began with a noble aim, a quest to bring democracy to a land choked under the despot's yoke. Yet, the spirit of that purpose has since withered, like the sun-kissed plains of our troops' march. Now, we fight not for the betterment of another's soul, but to prove ourselves a force to be reckoned with. The initial spark that ignited this conflict was a tale of family feuds and old grudges, a tangled web that entangled us in this endless dance of death and destruction.\n\nThe first few months were enough to send a clear message, to let the world know who we were. But the war has stretched on, a hungry beast fed by the blood of young men and the whispers of lost causes. We have long since lost our path, our purpose diluted like ink in water. We fight not for the freedom of others, but for the sake of fighting itself, a spectacle to prove our might. The time has come for us to step back, to let the locals fend for themselves, to tend to our own wounds and heal our own land.\n\nWe have spent untold billions, not on the well-being of our own citizens, but on the ashes of a foreign land. We have forgotten the plight of our own, the poverty and despair that festers within our own borders. This war, once a beacon of hope, has become a drain on our resources, a leech sucking the life from our nation. We must turn our gaze inward, to the roads that need mending, to the schools that cry out for attention, to the healthcare that is a privilege, not a right.\n\nThe war has gone on long enough. It is time to stop, to let the dust settle, to tend to our own wounds and heal our own land. For too long, we have been the torturer and the tortured, the executioner and the executed, the warrior and the war. It is time to turn away from this endless war, to focus on the needs of our own people, to let the world know that our strength lies not in distant battles, but in the unity and prosperity of our own land.",
            "Can I inquire, sir, about a matter that troubles my mind? I heard of an incident wherein a life was spared, yet I am uncertain of the circumstances.\n\nIt seems that some individual chanced upon a profile, obscured by the veil of the internet. Is this not an intrusion upon the sanctity of one's privacy? On sites such as Myspace, we must understand, once we post our information, it is exposed to the world.\n\nI am told that on Myspace, one must first be accepted as a 'friend' to view another's profile. Yet, this acceptance implies a tacit consent, does it not? If we share our lives on the internet, we must accept that many will gaze upon our private moments.\n\nIt is a delicate balance, this dance with the web. We may not have the time nor the resources to monitor every profile of every student in our school. But to target certain students, to delve into their private lives, is it not an act of discrimination? I wonder, what situation would justify such intrusion?\n\nI, myself, maintain a Facebook account. The thought of unseen eyes peering into my existence disturbs me. I have witnessed, on the screen, a man extracting information from a girl's profile with ease. Yet, I too have encountered strangers who seem to know me well, as if they have delved into my soul. It is a precarious situation, this digital world.\n\nMy roommate shared a tale of her high school days, where students were forbidden from using Myspace. I cannot fathom the power of high school officials to dictate such rules. Is this not an encroachment upon our privacy?",
            "Upshot of our discourse, son, is that I ain't one to beat the drum for the Iraq War. How could I be? It's been a tumbleweed of a mess, like a bloody sandstorm in the desert. From before we set foot in the godforsaken place to now, it's been a carpetbaggin' of errors and missteps. Just speakin' of it makes my teeth grind like a stone mill. Who in their right mind thought it a good idea to storm into Saddam's den? The world, for the most part, was screaming no, but those in charge, they just hummed along, deaf to the pleas and the evidence of the wind. I'm not one to join the chorus of the choir, but it's plain as day that the Iraqis, the folks we claimed to be helpin', want us to pack up and leave. Even the soldiers, the boots on the ground, they ain't fools. They see the futility, the quicksand we're sinkin' into. The administration, well, they're like a drunkard on a barstool, stuck in their delusions, clingin' to a hope that's as thin as a mosque's curtain. They talk about the problems that'll arise if we leave, but I ask you, what problems won't? This ain't about bein' the good guys, but about bein' the ones who make a clean getaway. It's a tightrope act, and we're danglin' from a frayin' thread.",
            "I reckon gender discrimination still lingers in these here United States. It ain't just women, mind you. No, sir. It's a matter of the specific trade you're in.\n\nTake the workplace, for instance. There's this... glass ceiling, they call it. It's like society's got a hard time seeing a woman above them. It's been that way for too long. You see a woman with all the qualifications for a job, but the board won't have her. It ain't right, that's for sure.\n\nNow, it's not just women either. Men have their own battles. Like in fashion, for example. People won't take 'em seriously, you know? They think, \"Well, how can a man know anything about fashion when it's for women?\" It's a strange sight, that's sure. But it's changing, slow as molasses, but it's changing.\n\nSociety's got to be reminded, you see. You can't just shove it in their faces. You gotta show 'em the good qualities. Like those men who stay at home to raise the kids. People look down on that, but it's changing, bit by bit.\n\nIt ain't easy, changing minds. We've come a long way, sure, but change takes time. It's like turning a ship. You can't just steer it straight at a cliff and expect it to turn. No, sir. You gotta nudge it, gently, towards the right path.\n\nSame goes for where you're from. If you're from a farm and you ain't got the best grammar, but you're smart as a whip, people might look down on you. They might think you ain't no CEO material. But they'd be wrong. It's like that old saying goes, \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\"\n\nSo, yeah, it's complicated. But we're getting there. Slow and steady, we're winning the race.",
            "In the quiet of my thoughts, I have discerned that what some call legalization was not the path we've trod, but rather decriminalization. A shift from the cold embrace of criminal law to a ticket, a merely inconvenient citation, akin to a speeding infraction. The weight of a cannabis charge, once a heavy burden, has been lifted, yet the specter of future ramifications lingers.\n\nThe financial toll of arresting, housing, and trying those accused is a burden many municipalities find too costly. The stark realization that such expenditure could fund public education, care for the elderly, and feed the destitute is a compelling argument. Yet, not all communities are so swayed, their moral compass still anchored against the indulgence of cannabis.\n\nDenver, a city of liberal leanings, has embraced this path, finding solace in the financial liberation it affords. The streets may not be filled with open embrace of marijuana, but the financial burden lifted has allowed for greater good to be achieved.\n\nThe question of open sale and use remains a touchy subject. The thought of cannabis being as prevalent as cigarettes is...well, unsettling. Our society still views it as taboo in many contexts, and I harbor concern that its open embrace would be met with discomfort.\n\nThe effects of alcohol and marijuana on the human mind and body are well-documented, and I would not generalize their impacts. Some react with restraint, others with abandon, and still others with moderation. The path of each is as varied as the substance itself.\n\nIn the end, I find myself at a crossroads, torn between the financial liberation and the societal discomfort. The question, as it always has been, is not one of morality, but of practicality.",
            "I would say no, for a multitude of reasons. The Catholic Church, in its prolonged tenure, has indeed been steadfast in its traditions, a virtue in its own right, yet it also needs to be flexible, like a river carving its path through the land. A river cannot continue to flow if it does not change course, adapt to the land, and merge with other waters.\n\nThe Church, like a river, has its bounds and its rituals. It is not uncommon for its adherents to be rigorous in their attendance, adhering to age-old practices. Yet, this adherence is not without its criticisms. One common complaint is the Church's intolerance towards those who do not strictly follow its doctrine, be they Catholics who falter or adherents of other religions. My own parents' experience, wherein my mother's Catholicism and my father's Episcopalianism prevented their union in the Church, is but one such example.\n\nThe Church preaches love and acceptance, yet it has been accused of hypocrisy in its failure to truly embrace those who do not fit its mold. This hypocrisy is not confined to its doctrine, but also in its practice, which often seems outdated and rigid. The Church continues to cling to these traditions, despite their archaic nature.\n\nThe matter of priests is another contentious one. I believe it would be beneficial for the Church to allow its clergy to marry, but I do not think it would necessarily deter pedophilic behavior among them. After all, the root of such atrocities lies not in marital status, but in the perpetrator's character. A predator, be they married or celibate, would likely act upon their impulses regardless of their marital status. The solution to such issues does not lie in marital status, but in the hearts and minds of the individuals themselves.",
            "Well, I ain't sure yet. The matter's got me tied in knots like a calf in a brier patch. It's like tryin' to split the difference between church and state, and what makes a marriage. It's a tricky business, and I reckon everybody's got their own take. I'm thinkin' maybe we should look at civil unions. Marriage, it's a sacred thing, sure, but the government, they ain't got no business in it. It's between two souls, and that's all there is to it. If the states can agree on something, they ought to make it law. But amendin' the Constitution? That's like tryin' to fix a leak with a hammer. Ain't no way. It's just not that important. So, no, I don't think so.",
            "I was raised in a household where the word of the Lord held sway, so the matter of homosexuality has always been a land of twilight for me. I have friends who walk that path, and it is a complex terrain to navigate. I do not harbor affection for the lifestyle, yet I believe it should find its place beneath the banner of legality, not as a matter of national debate but as a decision left to each state's discretion.\n\nSome states are of a democratic bent, others tilt republican, and each leans towards their own beliefs on this matter. To live in a state is to align oneself with its values, and I do not think one should question the decisions of their chosen home. I believe homosexuals should be granted the same opportunities as those who walk the well-trodden path of heterosexuality. It is a right that should be granted at the whim of each state, not dictated from on high.\n\nI find no compelling reason for the president, be he Bush or another, to impose his will upon the whole of this nation. He does not dwell in every state, nor should he have the authority to determine their course. The president's tenure is fleeting, and the wind of politics will shift with his departure. If a new president should lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be a matter of back and forth, a seesaw of policy that benefits no one save the lobbyists and their cronies.\n\nI stand firm in my belief that these matters should be left to the judgment of each individual state, for they are the ones who will bear the weight of their decisions. It is not the president's place to determine the fate of every state, nor should he be granted such power. The buck stops with the people, and it should be they who decide their own path.",
            "I reckon I don't at all.\nLet me consider this. I've been told that Myspace is akin to a public bulletin, there for all to see.\nIf one posts on the internet, be it for the public eye or just for others to read, one has to understand that it may reach beyond just the intended audience.\nIn my mind, if school officials happen upon such a post, they've a right to see it, no matter who's doing it or where from. They could've accessed it from their homes, after all.\nThough, if it's to prevent a school shooting, well, I say that's a responsibility they're simply fulfilling.\nNow, if they're prowling the internet just to catch students in the act, that's an invasion of privacy, plain and simple.\nBut if it's to make the school safer, then I can't fault them.\nIt's a public thing, and if a student posts something and doesn't expect to get into trouble, they're being more naive than I'd like.\nI've always been careful with what I put out there, even through emails. I fear something will come back to haunt me, and once it's on the internet, it's there to stay.\nI don't see how that's an invasion of privacy, though. They're just doing what they're supposed to be doing.\nIf they see something that could lead to a safer school environment, then I can't fault them. That's their responsibility, after all.\nSame goes for other officials like the police. Parents send their kids to school expecting a safe environment. School officials are just doing their part to ensure that.\nI've talked to a teacher about this, and they told me about all the drills they have in case of terrorist attacks. It's all about safety, you see.\nAnd that's exactly what the school officials were doing here. They were making the school a safer place. Preventing something like Columbine or worse.\nThat's all I can think to add.",
            "In the bloodied aftermath of September eleventh, I was a voice crying out for vengeance. The world had been set ablaze, and I yearned for retribution. I was all for the charge into the heart of darkness, a crusade to answer in kind the fire that had consumed our shores.\n\nYet, as the sands of time turned, I found myself stirred by doubt. The war, it seemed, was born of emotion, a blaze fueled by grief and anger. We rushed in unprepared, like a man charged at the gates of hell with no more than a flaming torch and a prayer.\n\nThe people of the land, they were like beasts of prey, caught in a ceaseless dance of violence. They fought one another, and we, too, were caught in their whirlwind. It became clear that their war was something other than our own. They did not seek to build, but to destroy, to chase us from their land.\n\nIn retrospect, we were drunk on the intoxicating brew of patriotism and fear. We charged in, not with a plan, but with a prayer. The road to hell, it seems, is paved with good intentions, and we had set our course for a destination we barely understood.\n\nThe president, he was a man of the people, and the people, they clamored for blood. He, too, was caught in the current, swept along by the tide of public opinion. Iraq, it seemed, was the scapegoat, the sacrifice to appease the gods of anger and fear.\n\nYet, even then, I saw the folly of our course. We were not the architects of order, but the spark of chaos. We sought to rebuild, yet we could not even agree on the path to order. Our divisions were as vast as the deserts we sought to tame.\n\nNow, I see the futility of our endeavor. We are like a drunken man stumbling in the dark, grasping for a door that is not there. The land is a wound that will not heal, a beast that will not be tamed. We are the intruders, the interlopers, and our presence is a cancer that will only harm the land.\n\nThe war, it seems, is a cycle, a never-ending dance of violence and death. We can withdraw, and the dance will continue, but the wound will not heal. We can stay, and the wound will fester, but the dance will not end.\n\nWe are the outsiders, the foreigners, and our presence is a poison. We can withdraw, and the poison will dissipate. Or we can stay, and the poison will continue to spread, infecting all who come near.\n\nI do not know if there is a right answer, only that we must find a way to break the cycle. The land, it seems, will not be ours to claim, but we can choose to leave, to allow it to heal in its own way."
