            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In certain respects, the Catholic Church finds itself in need of change. Their eyes upon the world have grown stale, their hearts unyielding against the winds of change. The Church, once a beacon of faith for many, now finds itself losing its flock, for it clings too tightly to doctrines that the world has outgrown. Consider the matter of gay marriage, abortion, and birth control—issues where the Church's stance is as unyielding as the rock it claims to follow. These positions, though rooted in tradition, are seen as antiquated by many, and the Church's refusal to adapt has driven a wedge between itself and the people. The Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, is an affront to those who believe in a woman's right to choose. And the same can be said for its stance on same-sex marriage, which some view as a breach of their own hearts.\n\nNow, I am not suggesting that the Church should abandon its core beliefs. Rather, I propose that it should consider a more compassionate and inclusive stance. The world outside the Church doors has shifted, and the Church must shift with it. The notion that priests are married to God is one that I, too, respect. Yet, I question why this union must be exclusive. Why not allow them to share their lives with those they love, as we all do? The Church's teachings on celibacy and the lack of female priests have long been a point of contention, and while I cannot guarantee that these changes would have prevented the scandals that have rocked the Church, I believe they would have mitigated some of the anger and disillusionment felt by the faithful.\n\nThe Church is a living thing, not a static monument. It must breathe, move, and adapt to survive. I urge the Church to consider these changes, to open its arms and its heart, and to become once again a beacon of hope and compassion for all people.",
            "Well, I reckon I don't hold a bone to pick with the matter of gay marriage. I mean, it's not like I've given it a great deal of contemplation, mind you, but it just don't seem right to me. It's not as if they can choose to be that way, like it's a conscious decision. I believe that people, be they of a certain persuasion or not, shouldn't be held accountable for how they're born.\n\nI've seen it said that a man and a woman can wed, but not two of the same sex. It seems a crooked sort of thinking to me. It's not like they choose their nature. I was born one way, another man might be born another. It seems a crime to hold them to account for their nature.\n\nNow, the federal government, well, I don't see them having much say in the matter. It ain't like it involves the safety of our land, nor is it a question of morals. It just seems they're sticking their nose in where it ain't wanted. They have no right to interject in the lives of others, least of all those who are born as they are. It's not a sin to be what you are, to be born that way.\n\nNo, I reckon that's about all I have to say on the matter. It's a hard thing to put into words, but I hope it makes sense.",
            "In the desolate expanse of these plains, there exists a conundrum, a divide as vast as the frontier itself. The matter of homosexual matrimony, a topic as intractable as the wilderness, is one that has emerged from the shadows of our past, demanding our attention. Why, then, should this union be denied?\n\nThe notion that such a pairing threatens the sanctity of the heterosexual union is as misguided as believing the sun sets in the east. They are but two aspects of the same coin, each face unique, yet each a valid expression of the human condition. The moral compass of one does not dictate the morality of another.\n\nConsider the civil rights that accompany this union. Property taxes, healthcare, the right to visit a partner in sickness and health. To deny these to those who choose to love differently is as absurd as denying the right of passage to a river that flows in a different direction. The arguments against such a union are thin and devoid of substance, much like the echoes of a ghost town in the wind.\n\nThe fear of adoption and the supposed ill effects on society's children is as unfounded as the fear of the unknown. The children of homosexual couples are as likely to be influenced by their parents' choices as are the children of heterosexual couples. The science is clear: the factors that contribute to a successful relationship are the same, regardless of the gender of the participants. The community, too, should not be feared; it is as likely to be enriched as it is to be changed.\n\nThe federal government, with its vast reach and authority, should intervene in this matter. It is time for the amendment to be reversed, to be made to reflect the reality that love, in all its myriad forms, is a fundamental right. President Bush's stance on this matter is as divisive as his stance on abortion and stem cell research. It is a stance rooted in morality, but a morality as fluid and changeable as the seasons.\n\nIt is a pity that such a stance is often rooted in the religious beliefs of the few, rather than the cultural beliefs of the many. To let religious convictions dictate federal law is as hypocritical as it is undemocratic. It is a betrayal of the nation's founding principles, a rejection of the freedom of belief. To deny the right to marry based on the beliefs of one group is as un-American as it is unjust.\n\nThe notion that homosexuality is a psychological defect or a result of trauma is as baseless as it is harmful. It is a notion that is refuted by the very institutions that have conducted the research. To listen to the voices of the educated and the studied, rather than the whispers of the uninformed and the prejudiced, is the path to understanding.\n\nThis is not a battle between morality and immorality, but a battle between understanding and ignorance. It is a battle that, like the frontier, needs to be fought, and fought with courage, with conviction, and with a heart open to the possibility of change.",
            "Well, first off, I tend to the pharmacy of a hospital come the summer months. It's a harsh world out there, but I've seen the cruel hand that some drugs have on the people. Now, I've heard it said that just because something is illegal, it must be beneficial. But I've seen the other side, too. The side where the law's writ is more a hindrance than a help. I say no, we should not make such things available to the masses. But, for the sake of those that need it, yes, for medicinal purposes, I say yes. The law's power is not absolute, not when it comes to the relief of suffering.\n\nThere are many a substance that's illegal, yet we use them in our pharmacies. Oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet - controlled substances, yes, but beneficial, too. We can't deny their worth, no matter the taboo that surrounds them. Marijuana is no different. It's a complex one, I'll grant you that. But I say, we should embrace its beneficial properties, like we have with others. The key lies in the gradual integration, not the abrupt shattering of the law. Because, you see, we can't just remove the taboo around it. We must first remove the stigma, the fear, the poison that's been fed into the minds of the people.\n\nIt's a tough one. Marijuana, like alcohol, can be abused. But so can alcohol, and that doesn't make it something to be cast aside. The difference lies in the perception, the image. Heroin and cocaine, now there are substances we should be wary of. But marijuana, it's not like that. It's not as harmful, not in the way that others are. And if we can change that perception, if we can let go of the fear and embrace the truth, then perhaps we can use it responsibly. For medicinal purposes, yes. But also for the benefit of those who seek solace in its embrace.",
            "Well, the church, she's a changin', ain't she? It's not as harsh as it once was. I reckon, when I was younger, it was Sundays and the prettiest dresses, matching shoes, too. I'd go to my private school and see all my pals there on weekends. It was somethin', it was.\n\nNow, they've done a turn with the teen masses, cut 'em down to thirty minutes, casual clothes, folks comin' in straight from the beach - I've seen it all. I remember when I'd get dressed up for the mornin' mass, now it's jeans and khakis, even in the heat of summer. The biggest change, I'd say, is the people. The families, they run late, some folks dress casual. It's a different feel.\n\nAs for the rest, I don't claim to know the politics of the church, but I reckon that's about it.\n\nNow, about them priests and their dealings with young'uns... well, I don't hold much water that they could've prevented it. There's men out there, married, and they still got it. It's in 'em, ain't it? Genetic, I reckon. You can't hide that away with a marriage. If they knew and covered it up, shame on 'em.

            "Well, I reckon I was in agreement with the initial narrative, but I tell ya, everyone was still reeling from that September first, and I think we got ourselves into Iraq under false pretenses. There were plenty of lies spun to rope us in, connecting Saddam Hussein to Bin Laden and those September eleventh attacks. We were told of weapons of mass destruction, but those claims proved as hollow as a snowball in hell. It galled me to my core, that's for sure.\n\nThat Bush administration, well, they seemed to have no qualms about deceiving the American people. Even their own dog didn't believe 'em. Colin Powell, he's said as much himself, that he wasn't convinced by that UN presentation. That's more than just a misstep, that's a high crime. A man like that, lying to the people, it's an impeachable offense.\n\nThey had no respect for the Constitution, not since September eleventh. They came into office with war on their mind, and I reckon they were itching for a fight with Saddam Hussein, like a hound after a rabbit. It's all about the oil, if you ask me.\n\nWe can't just up and leave now, though. Withdrawal might just throw the country into chaos, and we've already seen enough death. The coalition of nations they're talking about, Syria and Saudi Arabia, well, that's just asking for more trouble. Iraq's sovereignty, it's hanging by a thread, and their government's about as effective as a wet blanket. That interim government, it's as fractured as a shattered mirror. And let's not forget that old scoundrel, al-Sadr. His party's got a good hold in the Parliament, and they're just one of many trying to grab power. It's a bloody mess, that's for sure.",

Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be defying what's already been laid down. I think them pushing for it to be illegal is like choosing one church's belief over another. Catholics, most of them, they're against it. It's not for the government to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal, is it?\n\nSeparation of church and state, that's been a cornerstone of this here constitution. Making an amendment about it, I reckon that would be wrong. It would be going against what's already been said and written. Plus, it'd be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people, not the government. It's just not right, damn it.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government or any other government should be involved in this. I reckon he's pushing for this amendment just because it's against his own beliefs as a Catholic. It's like he's showing a preference for one religion over another. It should be up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any other government official.\n\nThere ain't no real reason behind this amendment except for his personal views. It ain't gonna impact the economy or society in no way. If anything, it might have a better impact on society than leaving it the way it is. I reckon that's about all I got to say on the matter.",
            "The war in Iraq, it began. A shroud of dishonesty, it was. The government, they said we'd find weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. They played on our grief, our outrage, our desire for vengeance. The invasion, 2003, it came.\n\nI, I was against it. War, it's a cruel beast, and I've seen its handiwork. The Vietnam War, it echoes. We removed their government, but chaos followed. We didn't plan for it, not properly. We planted a democratic seed, like in Vietnam, but it wouldn't grow without sun and rain, without time.\n\nSoldiers, they died. Too many. The government, they sang a different tune, said it'd be quick and clean. But it's been years, and still, we're there. Still, they're dying. We're training Iraqis, but it's slow. Democracy, it doesn't grow overnight, not even in our own land.\n\nThe oil, it's the root. That's why we're there. We control their resources, like we've always done. North Korea, it has weapons, and we do nothing. The government, they're not being truthful, not being thorough. They see dollar signs, not people.\n\nThe election, 2004, I thought about it. Bush, he started something. How can we abandon them now? We took their government, their way of life. But at what cost? American lives, they're precious. How much is too much?\n\nIt's a difficult decision, to leave. We must consider the future. But we must also consider the past, the present. The war, it's a monster, and it won't be easy to tame.\n\nI hope for peace, but I doubt it. It's a long road, and it's just begun.",
            "Let me see now, I reckon. I've always been in favor of that there gay marriage. Always have. It's a personal matter, a choice, you understand? Something that's a part of who a person is, not some stain on their soul. It ain't right to take away rights from folks for something they ain't got control over.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I ain't saying it's all black and white. There's always a gray area, but I believe it's about love, pure and simple. I've seen it with my own eyes. In my neighborhood, there's a few couples, two or three, they're gay, ain't married 'cause they ain't allowed. But they're just like any other family, walkin' their dogs, livin' their lives. It ain't right what Bush was tryin' to do, playin' God with his interpretation of marriage.\n\nIt's a personal thing, not somethin' the government should have a hand in. It's between two people, not the whole nation. I've read it myself, it's somethin' in your brain, a predisposition. It ain't about the way you were raised, it's who you are. It's like the difference between the way a man and a woman are made. It's biology, not sociology.\n\nAnd another thing, it's a private matter, not somethin' everyone needs to know about. If a man and a woman want to get hitched, they can just up and go to Las Vegas. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's big news. It's like they're some kind of spectacle. It's their life, their choice. It's time we let them live it in peace.\n\nNo, it ain't right what's been goin' on. It's not right to deny folks their rights just because they're different. It's time we stand up for what's right.",
            "Listen, I reckon you're aware of this, but let me spell it out for you. When you put something on the internet, you're making it public. As plain as day. No more hiding behind a wall of anonymity. I spoke on this very matter once, when I was an R.A. It's a fact of life, this internet business.\n\nNow, why, you ask, should you be so cautious? Well, consider this: if you're putting out there that you're about to blow things up, or pull a trigger, someone's gonna take notice. And they'll do something about it. Because the internet, it's not just for you and your friends. It's a vast, open plain, where everybody and their dog can be watching.\n\nI recall a time when something was overheard at school. Someone said something, and it was taken seriously. Why? Because the internet's no place for foolishness or jesting. It's a serious business, and what you say can have serious consequences. A sociology experiment gone wrong, maybe. Or perhaps something more dire.\n\nLet me tell you, the internet's a double-edged sword. You put something out there, you're inviting the world to see it. If you don't want it seen, don't put it there. It's as simple as that. You can't dictate what people think or how they take things. You can't control their reactions.\n\nNow, I ain't saying school officials should be snooping around, poking through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those social media contraptions. But if it's brought to their attention, that's a different ballgame. If there's danger, they gotta take it seriously. It's their duty.\n\nYou see, it's all about the line between what's private and what's public. And when it comes to the internet, that line gets mighty thin. So, think before you post. Because out there, in the wide-open internet, there's no hiding.",
            "The conflict has stretched on for an ungodly amount of time, a stain upon the earth that seems to have lost its purpose. Initially, the cause was noble - to restore democracy in a land ravaged by tyranny. But the motives have long since been sullied, like the rain in a drought-stricken land. The wind of war has turned into a howling gale, and we are no longer the lighthouse but the storm itself.\n\nThe war began with a clear purpose, a beacon of righteousness. But like the moon's shadow on the earth, it has grown long and twisted, a shadow of its former self. The initial purpose, to liberate the oppressed, has been eclipsed by a new purpose, one of power and domination. It is as if we are now waging war for the sake of war, a beast that feeds on itself and its own.\n\nThe road to war was paved with the bones of men and the blood of nations. It was once a path of righteousness, to stand against a tyrant. But the path has become a maze, a labyrinth of deceit and greed. We are no longer the saviors we once believed ourselves to be. We are the storm that does not abate, the rain that does not cease.\n\nThe war has become a drain on our very existence, a leech that feeds upon our economy. The money meant for our own shores, for our own people, is being spent in a foreign land, a land that may never know the touch of democracy. It is a blight upon our land, a cancer that must be excised.\n\nThe time has come for the war to end. The officials of that land must stand on their own two feet, as we must stand on ours. We cannot be the crutch that props up nations, for it is a crutch that will lead us to our own downfall. The money spent upon this war is a debt that will never be repaid, a debt that will lead to our own ruin.\n\nThe war must end. It is a futile, endless struggle, a battle that can never be won. It is a war that is no longer worth fighting. It is a war that we must leave behind, like a ghost that haunts a empty house. The time has come to turn our backs on war, to turn our faces towards home.",
            "Well, if I may, I'd like to inquire about this matter. I reckon it was averted due to someone uncannily stumbling upon certain information online. Now, I ain't one to insist on privacy, especially not on these here social sites like Myspace. If you put your life out there, for all the world to see, well, that's on you. It's like opening the gates to your own private sanctum. You might think you're sharing your life with friends, but you're also inviting the scrutiny of strangers. It's a double-edged sword, that's for sure. Now, I ain't got no Myspace myself, but I have me a Facebook. I've seen some sketchy characters out there, lurking in the shadows. I've seen how a person can dig up information like a coyote digging up a rabbit. They can find your name, talk to you, and before you know it, they're asking you to meet. I wouldn't do it, but some of my classmates, they ain't so careful. They don't know who they're talking to, or what they're giving away. It's a tricky business, all right. I only accept people I know, but you never know who might be watching. My roommate told me about her high school days, where they were banned from having Myspace. I reckon that's a bit harsh. I mean, how can they tell folks what they can't do? It ain't right, I tell you. It's a thorny issue, but I reckon it's one we all gotta navigate.",
            "Damn, I reckon we got ourselves in quite the pickle here. The Iraq War, it's been a godforsaken mess from the get-go. I feel like a right son of a bitch talking about it, like I'm just riding the wave of them who were against it from day one. But, hell, it doesn't matter much now, does it? The whole world's seen that it was a bad idea, even our own troops over there think we should be pulling out sooner rather than later. It's a goddamn disaster, and pulling out ain't gonna be no easier.\n\nI mean, look at the polls, will ya? Seventy-five, eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops. It's a goddamn consensus. It's like trying to force a square peg into a round hole. We're trying to bring democracy to a place where it don't belong, and it ain't gonna work. Saddam was a bastard, sure, but we should've weighed the pros and cons before we stomped in there. It was like dancing with the devil, and now we're up to our eyeballs in quicksand.\n\nI don't even know what to make of it all. I sure as hell ain't seen no good reason for us to stay any longer than we should. The administration? They're probably cooking up some hopeful ideas, but I ain't buying it. I've yet to hear a single legitimate reason for staying. If they want to do it gradually, over a year or two, I guess I could stomach it. But why should we stay now? Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, even a quarter of them want us to leave right now. These are the people we're trying to save, and they're telling us to fuck off. Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nAnd if we leave, what then? We'll be the goddamn good guys, won't we? Not really. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we won't be the ones who fucked it all up. We'll be the ones who tried to do what was right. But, who's to say they won't see us as the devils we are? No matter what we do, they'll always hate us.",
            "In these United States of ours, the specter of gender discrimination looms large. It cuts not merely along the lines of sex, but also carves deep into the very fabric of our societal tapestry. In the realm of labor, women, despite their qualifications, often find themselves trapped beneath an invisible glass ceiling, a relic of our collective past that shackles them to lesser positions. This is not to say that men are exempt; they too are not immune to the scourge of discrimination, be it in fashion, where the male figure is often overlooked, or in the domestic sphere, where the stay-at-home father is met with derision and scorn.\n\nThe path to change, however, is a labyrinth of slow progress. We have come far from the dark days of yore, but the march towards equality is a tortoise's pace. The women who claw their way to the upper echelons of business, and the men who choose to nurture their families rather than toil in the fields, are but the vanguard, their success stories slowly chipping away at the old notions that once dominated our minds.\n\nYet, change is also a double-edged sword. It must be wielded with care, lest it provoke a backlash. For every step forward, there are those who resist, who cling to the old ways, who see the new order as a threat to their own. It is a delicate dance, this progression, a slow ballet of acceptance and rejection. And so, we tread carefully, promoting the virtues of those who challenge the status quo, not by force, but by example. For in the end, it is not the loudest voice that wins, but the one that resonates, the one that touches the heart.\n\nBut discrimination, it seems, is not the sole domain of gender. It lurks in the shadows of our backgrounds, our upbringing, our speech. A man from the farm, his grammar rough, may find his intelligence undercut by his roots. His words, like his hands, bear the stigmata of his past, and some will find it difficult to see beyond the surface, to recognize the intellect within. The gendered gaze, then, is but one facet of a larger problem, one that afflicts us all.",
            "Well, they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it, knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more akin to a traffic ticket. You get cited, not booked and arrested. No more of that. And for young folks, the future ramifications are what they worry about. They don't go away, not completely. But there's a cost to all this, you know? Arresting, booking, housing, all of it. And the court dates, the public defenders, the judges, the state's attorney, it all adds up. Municipalities, especially those strapped for cash, they're not inclined to make that kind of concession, even if it'd free up a lot of money to spend on things they really need, like education, social programs, food for the homeless. I mean, it's not like we want marijuana to be everywhere, on every corner. And there are reasons why it shouldn't be. I don't know how I'd feel about it being like cigarettes, sold everywhere, smoked everywhere. It's still taboo in a lot of places. And it's not like either substance is completely harmless. Some people react differently, some people can handle it, some can't. It's not that simple. But I guess what I'm saying is, both have their own adverse effects. But I don't know.",
            "I would say yes, for I have witnessed much that is traditional in these matters, as if time itself has little sway upon their actions. It is good to be rooted, to remain steadfast in ways that have been handed down through generations. Yet, it is also vital to be adaptable, to find the balance between the old and the new. In this, the Catholic Church finds itself in a peculiar state. The weekly gathering, the rituals, the strict adherence to doctrine - these are not without their merit. Yet, there is a coldness in the way they view those who do not conform to their teachings, a lack of tolerance for the beliefs of others. It seems hypocritical, for we are taught to love all, yet are told to shun those who do not share our faith. My father, an Episcopalian, was refused the sacraments because of his belief. This is not tolerance, but divisiveness. The doctrine speaks of love, yet the practice is steeped in the dated trappings of centuries past. It is a struggle to reconcile the two.\n\nYet, I do not believe this would necessarily influence the behavior of those who have fallen so gravely from grace. The molestation of children is not a matter of marital status, but a dark seed that has taken root in the soul. A priest's marriage would not change the nature of his transgressions, for his actions are not born of conjugal relations, but of his own twisted heart. Allowing priests to marry would not prevent such horrors, for they are not the product of marital status, but of the depravity of the individual. It is a different realm entirely.",
            "I find myself at a crossroads, not yet firm in my stance on this contentious issue. The matter of church and state's separation, and the definition of marriage, is a labyrinth of thorny complexities that lie at the heart of our modern society. It is a tangled web, one that demands careful navigation to avoid offending those who walk its precarious path.\n\nI am of the opinion that marriage, in its secular form, should be recognized as a civil union. After all, what is marriage but a union of two souls, regardless of their beliefs or the rituals that bind them? If we are to maintain a separation of church and state, then the government should not delve into the intricacies of marriage, be it religious or otherwise. It is a union, a contract between two people, and no more.\n\nIf each state were to arrive at a consensus, then by all means, let them push for federal recognition. Yet, amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage is an absurdity. Such an amendment would be a stain on the sacred document we hold dear, a stain that would be remembered for generations to come. It is a cause that may be important to some, but it is not vital enough to warrant such a drastic measure. The constitution should not be amended for the sake of a single, albeit passionate, minority.\n\nSo, no, I cannot say that I support such an amendment. It goes against the very spirit of our nation, a spirit that was forged in the fires of diversity and tolerance.",
            "In the crucible of my youth, I was forged in a home sanctified by the teachings of a certain faith. The matter of homosexuality, then, is a labyrinthine conundrum, for I have known many friends whose hearts are inclined in ways that differ from the norm. Though I may not align with their path, I contend that this should not be a matter of national import but a matter of state's discretion. The republic is a tapestry woven with various hues, each state a distinct thread, and no single leader should presume to dictate the moral fabric of all. The winds of change can shift with the election of a new president, and I see no benefit in this back and forth, in this political whirlwind. It is the state, the people, who will bear the consequences of their decision, not the transient figure at the helm of the nation. So let it be. Let each state decide. Let the people's will be done.",
            "Well, now, I ain't got much to say on the matter, but let me spin this yarn real slow for ya.\n\nMyspace, it's a public thing, ain't it? A bulletin board, so to speak. When you put somethin' out there, you're puttin' it out there for the world to see, not just the school officials. But if they're lookin' out for the students' safety, well, ain't that their job? To keep 'em safe, to make that school a better place? Now, if they catch wind of a student postin' somethin' they shouldn't be, well, that's their responsibility, ain't it? If it's about keepin' the school safe, I can't see the harm in that.\n\nBut, if they're just snoopin' 'round, tryin' to catch students in trouble, that's a different story. That's pryin' into kids' private business. But if it's to keep 'em safe, to save lives, well, that's somethin' else entirely. It's all about the bigger picture, you see?\n\nI reckon it's a lot easier to express yourself writin' than talkin'. But the point is, it's a public thing. You post somethin' on there, you can't expect to get off scot-free. It's out there, for the world to see. And once it's out there, it's there forever. Can't unsee it, can't unread it. And if you're doin' somethin' you shouldn't be, well, that's gonna bite you in the ass sooner or later.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' they should go snoopin' around, just to catch students. But if they have somethin' that leads 'em to believe they need to make the school safer, well, then, I figure they're just doin' their job. It's all about makin' sure the kids are safe, ain't it? Just like we had drills for the terrorist attacks, to keep the school safe. That's what they were doin' here, just makin' sure nothin' bad happens, like what happened at Columbine.\n\nThat's about all I can say on the matter.",
            "In the wake of the unforgiving storm that was Nine-Eleven, I was consumed by a fervor that burned like coal in the heart of a desert. I was for it - the war - not so much for the ideals it purported to uphold, but for the raw, unbridled emotion that gripped the nation. I was, in a sense, a man possessed, driven by a thirst for retribution that blurred the lines of reason.\n\nAt first, I envisioned a swift and decisive strike, a brutal retaliation that would leave its mark indelibly on those who had dared to strike at our shores. But the passage of time, and the grim realities of war, have tempered that initial ardor. I now see that our entry into this conflict was akin to a drunkard stumbling into a fight, not knowing what awaits him in the darkness beyond the door.\n\nThe people of that land, they are not like us. They are a people forged in the crucible of ancient hatreds and ancient wars. Their war is not a noble pursuit, but a dance of death, a grim ritual where the sacred and the profane are one and the same. They fight not for a better future, but for a past that has long since passed, a past that is as much their curse as it is their pride.\n\nWe went in blind, driven by anger and a desire for vengeance. We did not know the terrain, nor the minds of our foes. We were like a bull charging into a maze, expecting to find a clear path, only to find ourselves lost and alone. And all the while, the people of that land remained divided, their infighting a symphony of chaos that drowned out the cries of the few who would have welcomed us as allies.\n\nOur presence there, it is a temporary salve on a wound that will not heal. It is a bandage over a festering infection. We are not the doctors who will heal this land, but merely the strangers arriving to tend to the dying. And in our haste, in our haste to act, we have forgotten the most basic tenet of war: to know thine enemy.\n\nI no longer seek to change the hearts of those people. I have come to realize that they are not like us, and never will be. They are a people locked in a cycle of violence, a cycle as old as time itself. We cannot impose our order on their chaos, for it is a chaos that has defined them for generations.\n\nThe longer we stay, the more we become entangled in their fate. And for what? To impose our will upon a people who will never accept it? To create an order where there is only chaos? It is a fool's errand, a futile pursuit that will only lead to our own undoing.\n\nI am no longer a man consumed by anger and a desire for vengeance. I am a man who has seen the absurdity of war, who has seen the futility of our efforts. I am a man who has come to realize that there are some battles that cannot be won, some wars that cannot be fought. And this is one of them."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In certain respects, the Catholic Church finds itself in need of change. Their eyes upon the world have grown stale, their hearts unyielding against the winds of change. The Church, once a beacon of faith for many, now finds itself losing its flock, for it clings too tightly to doctrines that the world has outgrown. Consider the matter of gay marriage, abortion, and birth control—issues where the Church's stance is as unyielding as the rock it claims to follow. These positions, though rooted in tradition, are seen as antiquated by many, and the Church's refusal to adapt has driven a wedge between itself and the people. The Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, is an affront to those who believe in a woman's right to choose. And the same can be said for its stance on same-sex marriage, which some view as a breach of their own hearts.\n\nNow, I am not suggesting that the Church should abandon its core beliefs. Rather, I propose that it should consider a more compassionate and inclusive stance. The world outside the Church doors has shifted, and the Church must shift with it. The notion that priests are married to God is one that I, too, respect. Yet, I question why this union must be exclusive. Why not allow them to share their lives with those they love, as we all do? The Church's teachings on celibacy and the lack of female priests have long been a point of contention, and while I cannot guarantee that these changes would have prevented the scandals that have rocked the Church, I believe they would have mitigated some of the anger and disillusionment felt by the faithful.\n\nThe Church is a living thing, not a static monument. It must breathe, move, and adapt to survive. I urge the Church to consider these changes, to open its arms and its heart, and to become once again a beacon of hope and compassion for all people.",
            "Well, I reckon I don't hold a bone to pick with the matter of gay marriage. I mean, it's not like I've given it a great deal of contemplation, mind you, but it just don't seem right to me. It's not as if they can choose to be that way, like it's a conscious decision. I believe that people, be they of a certain persuasion or not, shouldn't be held accountable for how they're born.\n\nI've seen it said that a man and a woman can wed, but not two of the same sex. It seems a crooked sort of thinking to me. It's not like they choose their nature. I was born one way, another man might be born another. It seems a crime to hold them to account for their nature.\n\nNow, the federal government, well, I don't see them having much say in the matter. It ain't like it involves the safety of our land, nor is it a question of morals. It just seems they're sticking their nose in where it ain't wanted. They have no right to interject in the lives of others, least of all those who are born as they are. It's not a sin to be what you are, to be born that way.\n\nNo, I reckon that's about all I have to say on the matter. It's a hard thing to put into words, but I hope it makes sense.",
            "In the desolate expanse of these plains, there exists a conundrum, a divide as vast as the frontier itself. The matter of homosexual matrimony, a topic as intractable as the wilderness, is one that has emerged from the shadows of our past, demanding our attention. Why, then, should this union be denied?\n\nThe notion that such a pairing threatens the sanctity of the heterosexual union is as misguided as believing the sun sets in the east. They are but two aspects of the same coin, each face unique, yet each a valid expression of the human condition. The moral compass of one does not dictate the morality of another.\n\nConsider the civil rights that accompany this union. Property taxes, healthcare, the right to visit a partner in sickness and health. To deny these to those who choose to love differently is as absurd as denying the right of passage to a river that flows in a different direction. The arguments against such a union are thin and devoid of substance, much like the echoes of a ghost town in the wind.\n\nThe fear of adoption and the supposed ill effects on society's children is as unfounded as the fear of the unknown. The children of homosexual couples are as likely to be influenced by their parents' choices as are the children of heterosexual couples. The science is clear: the factors that contribute to a successful relationship are the same, regardless of the gender of the participants. The community, too, should not be feared; it is as likely to be enriched as it is to be changed.\n\nThe federal government, with its vast reach and authority, should intervene in this matter. It is time for the amendment to be reversed, to be made to reflect the reality that love, in all its myriad forms, is a fundamental right. President Bush's stance on this matter is as divisive as his stance on abortion and stem cell research. It is a stance rooted in morality, but a morality as fluid and changeable as the seasons.\n\nIt is a pity that such a stance is often rooted in the religious beliefs of the few, rather than the cultural beliefs of the many. To let religious convictions dictate federal law is as hypocritical as it is undemocratic. It is a betrayal of the nation's founding principles, a rejection of the freedom of belief. To deny the right to marry based on the beliefs of one group is as un-American as it is unjust.\n\nThe notion that homosexuality is a psychological defect or a result of trauma is as baseless as it is harmful. It is a notion that is refuted by the very institutions that have conducted the research. To listen to the voices of the educated and the studied, rather than the whispers of the uninformed and the prejudiced, is the path to understanding.\n\nThis is not a battle between morality and immorality, but a battle between understanding and ignorance. It is a battle that, like the frontier, needs to be fought, and fought with courage, with conviction, and with a heart open to the possibility of change.",
            "Well, first off, I tend to the pharmacy of a hospital come the summer months. It's a harsh world out there, but I've seen the cruel hand that some drugs have on the people. Now, I've heard it said that just because something is illegal, it must be beneficial. But I've seen the other side, too. The side where the law's writ is more a hindrance than a help. I say no, we should not make such things available to the masses. But, for the sake of those that need it, yes, for medicinal purposes, I say yes. The law's power is not absolute, not when it comes to the relief of suffering.\n\nThere are many a substance that's illegal, yet we use them in our pharmacies. Oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet - controlled substances, yes, but beneficial, too. We can't deny their worth, no matter the taboo that surrounds them. Marijuana is no different. It's a complex one, I'll grant you that. But I say, we should embrace its beneficial properties, like we have with others. The key lies in the gradual integration, not the abrupt shattering of the law. Because, you see, we can't just remove the taboo around it. We must first remove the stigma, the fear, the poison that's been fed into the minds of the people.\n\nIt's a tough one. Marijuana, like alcohol, can be abused. But so can alcohol, and that doesn't make it something to be cast aside. The difference lies in the perception, the image. Heroin and cocaine, now there are substances we should be wary of. But marijuana, it's not like that. It's not as harmful, not in the way that others are. And if we can change that perception, if we can let go of the fear and embrace the truth, then perhaps we can use it responsibly. For medicinal purposes, yes. But also for the benefit of those who seek solace in its embrace.",
            "Well, the church, she's a changin', ain't she? It's not as harsh as it once was. I reckon, when I was younger, it was Sundays and the prettiest dresses, matching shoes, too. I'd go to my private school and see all my pals there on weekends. It was somethin', it was.\n\nNow, they've done a turn with the teen masses, cut 'em down to thirty minutes, casual clothes, folks comin' in straight from the beach - I've seen it all. I remember when I'd get dressed up for the mornin' mass, now it's jeans and khakis, even in the heat of summer. The biggest change, I'd say, is the people. The families, they run late, some folks dress casual. It's a different feel.\n\nAs for the rest, I don't claim to know the politics of the church, but I reckon that's about it.\n\nNow, about them priests and their dealings with young'uns... well, I don't hold much water that they could've prevented it. There's men out there, married, and they still got it. It's in 'em, ain't it? Genetic, I reckon. You can't hide that away with a marriage. If they knew and covered it up, shame on 'em.

            "Well, I reckon I was in agreement with the initial narrative, but I tell ya, everyone was still reeling from that September first, and I think we got ourselves into Iraq under false pretenses. There were plenty of lies spun to rope us in, connecting Saddam Hussein to Bin Laden and those September eleventh attacks. We were told of weapons of mass destruction, but those claims proved as hollow as a snowball in hell. It galled me to my core, that's for sure.\n\nThat Bush administration, well, they seemed to have no qualms about deceiving the American people. Even their own dog didn't believe 'em. Colin Powell, he's said as much himself, that he wasn't convinced by that UN presentation. That's more than just a misstep, that's a high crime. A man like that, lying to the people, it's an impeachable offense.\n\nThey had no respect for the Constitution, not since September eleventh. They came into office with war on their mind, and I reckon they were itching for a fight with Saddam Hussein, like a hound after a rabbit. It's all about the oil, if you ask me.\n\nWe can't just up and leave now, though. Withdrawal might just throw the country into chaos, and we've already seen enough death. The coalition of nations they're talking about, Syria and Saudi Arabia, well, that's just asking for more trouble. Iraq's sovereignty, it's hanging by a thread, and their government's about as effective as a wet blanket. That interim government, it's as fractured as a shattered mirror. And let's not forget that old scoundrel, al-Sadr. His party's got a good hold in the Parliament, and they're just one of many trying to grab power. It's a bloody mess, that's for sure.",

Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be defying what's already been laid down. I think them pushing for it to be illegal is like choosing one church's belief over another. Catholics, most of them, they're against it. It's not for the government to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal, is it?\n\nSeparation of church and state, that's been a cornerstone of this here constitution. Making an amendment about it, I reckon that would be wrong. It would be going against what's already been said and written. Plus, it'd be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people, not the government. It's just not right, damn it.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government or any other government should be involved in this. I reckon he's pushing for this amendment just because it's against his own beliefs as a Catholic. It's like he's showing a preference for one religion over another. It should be up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any other government official.\n\nThere ain't no real reason behind this amendment except for his personal views. It ain't gonna impact the economy or society in no way. If anything, it might have a better impact on society than leaving it the way it is. I reckon that's about all I got to say on the matter.",
            "The war in Iraq, it began. A shroud of dishonesty, it was. The government, they said we'd find weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. They played on our grief, our outrage, our desire for vengeance. The invasion, 2003, it came.\n\nI, I was against it. War, it's a cruel beast, and I've seen its handiwork. The Vietnam War, it echoes. We removed their government, but chaos followed. We didn't plan for it, not properly. We planted a democratic seed, like in Vietnam, but it wouldn't grow without sun and rain, without time.\n\nSoldiers, they died. Too many. The government, they sang a different tune, said it'd be quick and clean. But it's been years, and still, we're there. Still, they're dying. We're training Iraqis, but it's slow. Democracy, it doesn't grow overnight, not even in our own land.\n\nThe oil, it's the root. That's why we're there. We control their resources, like we've always done. North Korea, it has weapons, and we do nothing. The government, they're not being truthful, not being thorough. They see dollar signs, not people.\n\nThe election, 2004, I thought about it. Bush, he started something. How can we abandon them now? We took their government, their way of life. But at what cost? American lives, they're precious. How much is too much?\n\nIt's a difficult decision, to leave. We must consider the future. But we must also consider the past, the present. The war, it's a monster, and it won't be easy to tame.\n\nI hope for peace, but I doubt it. It's a long road, and it's just begun.",
            "Let me see now, I reckon. I've always been in favor of that there gay marriage. Always have. It's a personal matter, a choice, you understand? Something that's a part of who a person is, not some stain on their soul. It ain't right to take away rights from folks for something they ain't got control over.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I ain't saying it's all black and white. There's always a gray area, but I believe it's about love, pure and simple. I've seen it with my own eyes. In my neighborhood, there's a few couples, two or three, they're gay, ain't married 'cause they ain't allowed. But they're just like any other family, walkin' their dogs, livin' their lives. It ain't right what Bush was tryin' to do, playin' God with his interpretation of marriage.\n\nIt's a personal thing, not somethin' the government should have a hand in. It's between two people, not the whole nation. I've read it myself, it's somethin' in your brain, a predisposition. It ain't about the way you were raised, it's who you are. It's like the difference between the way a man and a woman are made. It's biology, not sociology.\n\nAnd another thing, it's a private matter, not somethin' everyone needs to know about. If a man and a woman want to get hitched, they can just up and go to Las Vegas. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's big news. It's like they're some kind of spectacle. It's their life, their choice. It's time we let them live it in peace.\n\nNo, it ain't right what's been goin' on. It's not right to deny folks their rights just because they're different. It's time we stand up for what's right.",
            "Listen, I reckon you're aware of this, but let me spell it out for you. When you put something on the internet, you're making it public. As plain as day. No more hiding behind a wall of anonymity. I spoke on this very matter once, when I was an R.A. It's a fact of life, this internet business.\n\nNow, why, you ask, should you be so cautious? Well, consider this: if you're putting out there that you're about to blow things up, or pull a trigger, someone's gonna take notice. And they'll do something about it. Because the internet, it's not just for you and your friends. It's a vast, open plain, where everybody and their dog can be watching.\n\nI recall a time when something was overheard at school. Someone said something, and it was taken seriously. Why? Because the internet's no place for foolishness or jesting. It's a serious business, and what you say can have serious consequences. A sociology experiment gone wrong, maybe. Or perhaps something more dire.\n\nLet me tell you, the internet's a double-edged sword. You put something out there, you're inviting the world to see it. If you don't want it seen, don't put it there. It's as simple as that. You can't dictate what people think or how they take things. You can't control their reactions.\n\nNow, I ain't saying school officials should be snooping around, poking through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those social media contraptions. But if it's brought to their attention, that's a different ballgame. If there's danger, they gotta take it seriously. It's their duty.\n\nYou see, it's all about the line between what's private and what's public. And when it comes to the internet, that line gets mighty thin. So, think before you post. Because out there, in the wide-open internet, there's no hiding.",
            "The conflict has stretched on for an ungodly amount of time, a stain upon the earth that seems to have lost its purpose. Initially, the cause was noble - to restore democracy in a land ravaged by tyranny. But the motives have long since been sullied, like the rain in a drought-stricken land. The wind of war has turned into a howling gale, and we are no longer the lighthouse but the storm itself.\n\nThe war began with a clear purpose, a beacon of righteousness. But like the moon's shadow on the earth, it has grown long and twisted, a shadow of its former self. The initial purpose, to liberate the oppressed, has been eclipsed by a new purpose, one of power and domination. It is as if we are now waging war for the sake of war, a beast that feeds on itself and its own.\n\nThe road to war was paved with the bones of men and the blood of nations. It was once a path of righteousness, to stand against a tyrant. But the path has become a maze, a labyrinth of deceit and greed. We are no longer the saviors we once believed ourselves to be. We are the storm that does not abate, the rain that does not cease.\n\nThe war has become a drain on our very existence, a leech that feeds upon our economy. The money meant for our own shores, for our own people, is being spent in a foreign land, a land that may never know the touch of democracy. It is a blight upon our land, a cancer that must be excised.\n\nThe time has come for the war to end. The officials of that land must stand on their own two feet, as we must stand on ours. We cannot be the crutch that props up nations, for it is a crutch that will lead us to our own downfall. The money spent upon this war is a debt that will never be repaid, a debt that will lead to our own ruin.\n\nThe war must end. It is a futile, endless struggle, a battle that can never be won. It is a war that is no longer worth fighting. It is a war that we must leave behind, like a ghost that haunts a empty house. The time has come to turn our backs on war, to turn our faces towards home.",
            "Well, if I may, I'd like to inquire about this matter. I reckon it was averted due to someone uncannily stumbling upon certain information online. Now, I ain't one to insist on privacy, especially not on these here social sites like Myspace. If you put your life out there, for all the world to see, well, that's on you. It's like opening the gates to your own private sanctum. You might think you're sharing your life with friends, but you're also inviting the scrutiny of strangers. It's a double-edged sword, that's for sure. Now, I ain't got no Myspace myself, but I have me a Facebook. I've seen some sketchy characters out there, lurking in the shadows. I've seen how a person can dig up information like a coyote digging up a rabbit. They can find your name, talk to you, and before you know it, they're asking you to meet. I wouldn't do it, but some of my classmates, they ain't so careful. They don't know who they're talking to, or what they're giving away. It's a tricky business, all right. I only accept people I know, but you never know who might be watching. My roommate told me about her high school days, where they were banned from having Myspace. I reckon that's a bit harsh. I mean, how can they tell folks what they can't do? It ain't right, I tell you. It's a thorny issue, but I reckon it's one we all gotta navigate.",
            "Damn, I reckon we got ourselves in quite the pickle here. The Iraq War, it's been a godforsaken mess from the get-go. I feel like a right son of a bitch talking about it, like I'm just riding the wave of them who were against it from day one. But, hell, it doesn't matter much now, does it? The whole world's seen that it was a bad idea, even our own troops over there think we should be pulling out sooner rather than later. It's a goddamn disaster, and pulling out ain't gonna be no easier.\n\nI mean, look at the polls, will ya? Seventy-five, eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops. It's a goddamn consensus. It's like trying to force a square peg into a round hole. We're trying to bring democracy to a place where it don't belong, and it ain't gonna work. Saddam was a bastard, sure, but we should've weighed the pros and cons before we stomped in there. It was like dancing with the devil, and now we're up to our eyeballs in quicksand.\n\nI don't even know what to make of it all. I sure as hell ain't seen no good reason for us to stay any longer than we should. The administration? They're probably cooking up some hopeful ideas, but I ain't buying it. I've yet to hear a single legitimate reason for staying. If they want to do it gradually, over a year or two, I guess I could stomach it. But why should we stay now? Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, even a quarter of them want us to leave right now. These are the people we're trying to save, and they're telling us to fuck off. Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nAnd if we leave, what then? We'll be the goddamn good guys, won't we? Not really. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we won't be the ones who fucked it all up. We'll be the ones who tried to do what was right. But, who's to say they won't see us as the devils we are? No matter what we do, they'll always hate us.",
            "In these United States of ours, the specter of gender discrimination looms large. It cuts not merely along the lines of sex, but also carves deep into the very fabric of our societal tapestry. In the realm of labor, women, despite their qualifications, often find themselves trapped beneath an invisible glass ceiling, a relic of our collective past that shackles them to lesser positions. This is not to say that men are exempt; they too are not immune to the scourge of discrimination, be it in fashion, where the male figure is often overlooked, or in the domestic sphere, where the stay-at-home father is met with derision and scorn.\n\nThe path to change, however, is a labyrinth of slow progress. We have come far from the dark days of yore, but the march towards equality is a tortoise's pace. The women who claw their way to the upper echelons of business, and the men who choose to nurture their families rather than toil in the fields, are but the vanguard, their success stories slowly chipping away at the old notions that once dominated our minds.\n\nYet, change is also a double-edged sword. It must be wielded with care, lest it provoke a backlash. For every step forward, there are those who resist, who cling to the old ways, who see the new order as a threat to their own. It is a delicate dance, this progression, a slow ballet of acceptance and rejection. And so, we tread carefully, promoting the virtues of those who challenge the status quo, not by force, but by example. For in the end, it is not the loudest voice that wins, but the one that resonates, the one that touches the heart.\n\nBut discrimination, it seems, is not the sole domain of gender. It lurks in the shadows of our backgrounds, our upbringing, our speech. A man from the farm, his grammar rough, may find his intelligence undercut by his roots. His words, like his hands, bear the stigmata of his past, and some will find it difficult to see beyond the surface, to recognize the intellect within. The gendered gaze, then, is but one facet of a larger problem, one that afflicts us all.",
            "Well, they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it, knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more akin to a traffic ticket. You get cited, not booked and arrested. No more of that. And for young folks, the future ramifications are what they worry about. They don't go away, not completely. But there's a cost to all this, you know? Arresting, booking, housing, all of it. And the court dates, the public defenders, the judges, the state's attorney, it all adds up. Municipalities, especially those strapped for cash, they're not inclined to make that kind of concession, even if it'd free up a lot of money to spend on things they really need, like education, social programs, food for the homeless. I mean, it's not like we want marijuana to be everywhere, on every corner. And there are reasons why it shouldn't be. I don't know how I'd feel about it being like cigarettes, sold everywhere, smoked everywhere. It's still taboo in a lot of places. And it's not like either substance is completely harmless. Some people react differently, some people can handle it, some can't. It's not that simple. But I guess what I'm saying is, both have their own adverse effects. But I don't know.",
            "I would say yes, for I have witnessed much that is traditional in these matters, as if time itself has little sway upon their actions. It is good to be rooted, to remain steadfast in ways that have been handed down through generations. Yet, it is also vital to be adaptable, to find the balance between the old and the new. In this, the Catholic Church finds itself in a peculiar state. The weekly gathering, the rituals, the strict adherence to doctrine - these are not without their merit. Yet, there is a coldness in the way they view those who do not conform to their teachings, a lack of tolerance for the beliefs of others. It seems hypocritical, for we are taught to love all, yet are told to shun those who do not share our faith. My father, an Episcopalian, was refused the sacraments because of his belief. This is not tolerance, but divisiveness. The doctrine speaks of love, yet the practice is steeped in the dated trappings of centuries past. It is a struggle to reconcile the two.\n\nYet, I do not believe this would necessarily influence the behavior of those who have fallen so gravely from grace. The molestation of children is not a matter of marital status, but a dark seed that has taken root in the soul. A priest's marriage would not change the nature of his transgressions, for his actions are not born of conjugal relations, but of his own twisted heart. Allowing priests to marry would not prevent such horrors, for they are not the product of marital status, but of the depravity of the individual. It is a different realm entirely.",
            "I find myself at a crossroads, not yet firm in my stance on this contentious issue. The matter of church and state's separation, and the definition of marriage, is a labyrinth of thorny complexities that lie at the heart of our modern society. It is a tangled web, one that demands careful navigation to avoid offending those who walk its precarious path.\n\nI am of the opinion that marriage, in its secular form, should be recognized as a civil union. After all, what is marriage but a union of two souls, regardless of their beliefs or the rituals that bind them? If we are to maintain a separation of church and state, then the government should not delve into the intricacies of marriage, be it religious or otherwise. It is a union, a contract between two people, and no more.\n\nIf each state were to arrive at a consensus, then by all means, let them push for federal recognition. Yet, amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage is an absurdity. Such an amendment would be a stain on the sacred document we hold dear, a stain that would be remembered for generations to come. It is a cause that may be important to some, but it is not vital enough to warrant such a drastic measure. The constitution should not be amended for the sake of a single, albeit passionate, minority.\n\nSo, no, I cannot say that I support such an amendment. It goes against the very spirit of our nation, a spirit that was forged in the fires of diversity and tolerance.",
            "In the crucible of my youth, I was forged in a home sanctified by the teachings of a certain faith. The matter of homosexuality, then, is a labyrinthine conundrum, for I have known many friends whose hearts are inclined in ways that differ from the norm. Though I may not align with their path, I contend that this should not be a matter of national import but a matter of state's discretion. The republic is a tapestry woven with various hues, each state a distinct thread, and no single leader should presume to dictate the moral fabric of all. The winds of change can shift with the election of a new president, and I see no benefit in this back and forth, in this political whirlwind. It is the state, the people, who will bear the consequences of their decision, not the transient figure at the helm of the nation. So let it be. Let each state decide. Let the people's will be done.",
            "Well, now, I ain't got much to say on the matter, but let me spin this yarn real slow for ya.\n\nMyspace, it's a public thing, ain't it? A bulletin board, so to speak. When you put somethin' out there, you're puttin' it out there for the world to see, not just the school officials. But if they're lookin' out for the students' safety, well, ain't that their job? To keep 'em safe, to make that school a better place? Now, if they catch wind of a student postin' somethin' they shouldn't be, well, that's their responsibility, ain't it? If it's about keepin' the school safe, I can't see the harm in that.\n\nBut, if they're just snoopin' 'round, tryin' to catch students in trouble, that's a different story. That's pryin' into kids' private business. But if it's to keep 'em safe, to save lives, well, that's somethin' else entirely. It's all about the bigger picture, you see?\n\nI reckon it's a lot easier to express yourself writin' than talkin'. But the point is, it's a public thing. You post somethin' on there, you can't expect to get off scot-free. It's out there, for the world to see. And once it's out there, it's there forever. Can't unsee it, can't unread it. And if you're doin' somethin' you shouldn't be, well, that's gonna bite you in the ass sooner or later.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' they should go snoopin' around, just to catch students. But if they have somethin' that leads 'em to believe they need to make the school safer, well, then, I figure they're just doin' their job. It's all about makin' sure the kids are safe, ain't it? Just like we had drills for the terrorist attacks, to keep the school safe. That's what they were doin' here, just makin' sure nothin' bad happens, like what happened at Columbine.\n\nThat's about all I can say on the matter.",
            "In the wake of the unforgiving storm that was Nine-Eleven, I was consumed by a fervor that burned like coal in the heart of a desert. I was for it - the war - not so much for the ideals it purported to uphold, but for the raw, unbridled emotion that gripped the nation. I was, in a sense, a man possessed, driven by a thirst for retribution that blurred the lines of reason.\n\nAt first, I envisioned a swift and decisive strike, a brutal retaliation that would leave its mark indelibly on those who had dared to strike at our shores. But the passage of time, and the grim realities of war, have tempered that initial ardor. I now see that our entry into this conflict was akin to a drunkard stumbling into a fight, not knowing what awaits him in the darkness beyond the door.\n\nThe people of that land, they are not like us. They are a people forged in the crucible of ancient hatreds and ancient wars. Their war is not a noble pursuit, but a dance of death, a grim ritual where the sacred and the profane are one and the same. They fight not for a better future, but for a past that has long since passed, a past that is as much their curse as it is their pride.\n\nWe went in blind, driven by anger and a desire for vengeance. We did not know the terrain, nor the minds of our foes. We were like a bull charging into a maze, expecting to find a clear path, only to find ourselves lost and alone. And all the while, the people of that land remained divided, their infighting a symphony of chaos that drowned out the cries of the few who would have welcomed us as allies.\n\nOur presence there, it is a temporary salve on a wound that will not heal. It is a bandage over a festering infection. We are not the doctors who will heal this land, but merely the strangers arriving to tend to the dying. And in our haste, in our haste to act, we have forgotten the most basic tenet of war: to know thine enemy.\n\nI no longer seek to change the hearts of those people. I have come to realize that they are not like us, and never will be. They are a people locked in a cycle of violence, a cycle as old as time itself. We cannot impose our order on their chaos, for it is a chaos that has defined them for generations.\n\nThe longer we stay, the more we become entangled in their fate. And for what? To impose our will upon a people who will never accept it? To create an order where there is only chaos? It is a fool's errand, a futile pursuit that will only lead to our own undoing.\n\nI am no longer a man consumed by anger and a desire for vengeance. I am a man who has seen the absurdity of war, who has seen the futility of our efforts. I am a man who has come to realize that there are some battles that cannot be won, some wars that cannot be fought. And this is one of them."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In certain respects, the Catholic Church finds itself in need of change. Their eyes upon the world have grown stale, their hearts unyielding against the winds of change. The Church, once a beacon of faith for many, now finds itself losing its flock, for it clings too tightly to doctrines that the world has outgrown. Consider the matter of gay marriage, abortion, and birth control—issues where the Church's stance is as unyielding as the rock it claims to follow. These positions, though rooted in tradition, are seen as antiquated by many, and the Church's refusal to adapt has driven a wedge between itself and the people. The Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, is an affront to those who believe in a woman's right to choose. And the same can be said for its stance on same-sex marriage, which some view as a breach of their own hearts.\n\nNow, I am not suggesting that the Church should abandon its core beliefs. Rather, I propose that it should consider a more compassionate and inclusive stance. The world outside the Church doors has shifted, and the Church must shift with it. The notion that priests are married to God is one that I, too, respect. Yet, I question why this union must be exclusive. Why not allow them to share their lives with those they love, as we all do? The Church's teachings on celibacy and the lack of female priests have long been a point of contention, and while I cannot guarantee that these changes would have prevented the scandals that have rocked the Church, I believe they would have mitigated some of the anger and disillusionment felt by the faithful.\n\nThe Church is a living thing, not a static monument. It must breathe, move, and adapt to survive. I urge the Church to consider these changes, to open its arms and its heart, and to become once again a beacon of hope and compassion for all people.",
            "Well, I reckon I don't hold a bone to pick with the matter of gay marriage. I mean, it's not like I've given it a great deal of contemplation, mind you, but it just don't seem right to me. It's not as if they can choose to be that way, like it's a conscious decision. I believe that people, be they of a certain persuasion or not, shouldn't be held accountable for how they're born.\n\nI've seen it said that a man and a woman can wed, but not two of the same sex. It seems a crooked sort of thinking to me. It's not like they choose their nature. I was born one way, another man might be born another. It seems a crime to hold them to account for their nature.\n\nNow, the federal government, well, I don't see them having much say in the matter. It ain't like it involves the safety of our land, nor is it a question of morals. It just seems they're sticking their nose in where it ain't wanted. They have no right to interject in the lives of others, least of all those who are born as they are. It's not a sin to be what you are, to be born that way.\n\nNo, I reckon that's about all I have to say on the matter. It's a hard thing to put into words, but I hope it makes sense.",
            "In the desolate expanse of these plains, there exists a conundrum, a divide as vast as the frontier itself. The matter of homosexual matrimony, a topic as intractable as the wilderness, is one that has emerged from the shadows of our past, demanding our attention. Why, then, should this union be denied?\n\nThe notion that such a pairing threatens the sanctity of the heterosexual union is as misguided as believing the sun sets in the east. They are but two aspects of the same coin, each face unique, yet each a valid expression of the human condition. The moral compass of one does not dictate the morality of another.\n\nConsider the civil rights that accompany this union. Property taxes, healthcare, the right to visit a partner in sickness and health. To deny these to those who choose to love differently is as absurd as denying the right of passage to a river that flows in a different direction. The arguments against such a union are thin and devoid of substance, much like the echoes of a ghost town in the wind.\n\nThe fear of adoption and the supposed ill effects on society's children is as unfounded as the fear of the unknown. The children of homosexual couples are as likely to be influenced by their parents' choices as are the children of heterosexual couples. The science is clear: the factors that contribute to a successful relationship are the same, regardless of the gender of the participants. The community, too, should not be feared; it is as likely to be enriched as it is to be changed.\n\nThe federal government, with its vast reach and authority, should intervene in this matter. It is time for the amendment to be reversed, to be made to reflect the reality that love, in all its myriad forms, is a fundamental right. President Bush's stance on this matter is as divisive as his stance on abortion and stem cell research. It is a stance rooted in morality, but a morality as fluid and changeable as the seasons.\n\nIt is a pity that such a stance is often rooted in the religious beliefs of the few, rather than the cultural beliefs of the many. To let religious convictions dictate federal law is as hypocritical as it is undemocratic. It is a betrayal of the nation's founding principles, a rejection of the freedom of belief. To deny the right to marry based on the beliefs of one group is as un-American as it is unjust.\n\nThe notion that homosexuality is a psychological defect or a result of trauma is as baseless as it is harmful. It is a notion that is refuted by the very institutions that have conducted the research. To listen to the voices of the educated and the studied, rather than the whispers of the uninformed and the prejudiced, is the path to understanding.\n\nThis is not a battle between morality and immorality, but a battle between understanding and ignorance. It is a battle that, like the frontier, needs to be fought, and fought with courage, with conviction, and with a heart open to the possibility of change.",
            "Well, first off, I tend to the pharmacy of a hospital come the summer months. It's a harsh world out there, but I've seen the cruel hand that some drugs have on the people. Now, I've heard it said that just because something is illegal, it must be beneficial. But I've seen the other side, too. The side where the law's writ is more a hindrance than a help. I say no, we should not make such things available to the masses. But, for the sake of those that need it, yes, for medicinal purposes, I say yes. The law's power is not absolute, not when it comes to the relief of suffering.\n\nThere are many a substance that's illegal, yet we use them in our pharmacies. Oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocet - controlled substances, yes, but beneficial, too. We can't deny their worth, no matter the taboo that surrounds them. Marijuana is no different. It's a complex one, I'll grant you that. But I say, we should embrace its beneficial properties, like we have with others. The key lies in the gradual integration, not the abrupt shattering of the law. Because, you see, we can't just remove the taboo around it. We must first remove the stigma, the fear, the poison that's been fed into the minds of the people.\n\nIt's a tough one. Marijuana, like alcohol, can be abused. But so can alcohol, and that doesn't make it something to be cast aside. The difference lies in the perception, the image. Heroin and cocaine, now there are substances we should be wary of. But marijuana, it's not like that. It's not as harmful, not in the way that others are. And if we can change that perception, if we can let go of the fear and embrace the truth, then perhaps we can use it responsibly. For medicinal purposes, yes. But also for the benefit of those who seek solace in its embrace.",
            "Well, the church, she's a changin', ain't she? It's not as harsh as it once was. I reckon, when I was younger, it was Sundays and the prettiest dresses, matching shoes, too. I'd go to my private school and see all my pals there on weekends. It was somethin', it was.\n\nNow, they've done a turn with the teen masses, cut 'em down to thirty minutes, casual clothes, folks comin' in straight from the beach - I've seen it all. I remember when I'd get dressed up for the mornin' mass, now it's jeans and khakis, even in the heat of summer. The biggest change, I'd say, is the people. The families, they run late, some folks dress casual. It's a different feel.\n\nAs for the rest, I don't claim to know the politics of the church, but I reckon that's about it.\n\nNow, about them priests and their dealings with young'uns... well, I don't hold much water that they could've prevented it. There's men out there, married, and they still got it. It's in 'em, ain't it? Genetic, I reckon. You can't hide that away with a marriage. If they knew and covered it up, shame on 'em.

            "Well, I reckon I was in agreement with the initial narrative, but I tell ya, everyone was still reeling from that September first, and I think we got ourselves into Iraq under false pretenses. There were plenty of lies spun to rope us in, connecting Saddam Hussein to Bin Laden and those September eleventh attacks. We were told of weapons of mass destruction, but those claims proved as hollow as a snowball in hell. It galled me to my core, that's for sure.\n\nThat Bush administration, well, they seemed to have no qualms about deceiving the American people. Even their own dog didn't believe 'em. Colin Powell, he's said as much himself, that he wasn't convinced by that UN presentation. That's more than just a misstep, that's a high crime. A man like that, lying to the people, it's an impeachable offense.\n\nThey had no respect for the Constitution, not since September eleventh. They came into office with war on their mind, and I reckon they were itching for a fight with Saddam Hussein, like a hound after a rabbit. It's all about the oil, if you ask me.\n\nWe can't just up and leave now, though. Withdrawal might just throw the country into chaos, and we've already seen enough death. The coalition of nations they're talking about, Syria and Saudi Arabia, well, that's just asking for more trouble. Iraq's sovereignty, it's hanging by a thread, and their government's about as effective as a wet blanket. That interim government, it's as fractured as a shattered mirror. And let's not forget that old scoundrel, al-Sadr. His party's got a good hold in the Parliament, and they're just one of many trying to grab power. It's a bloody mess, that's for sure.",
            "I did\nMmhmm\nJust talk into it?  ...\nOk\nOk cool\nUh huh\nUh\nOk I’m sorry\nOk\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point, I feel it’s a futile endeavor, not a declared war as such\nBut a retaliation, an eye for an eye\nAs it were, for those who struck us\nThe ones behind the towers that fell\nI don’t keep tabs on it\nI don’t know the ins and outs\nBut I know we’re there to impose democracy\nAnd secure oil\nYet, it doesn’t sit well\nFor it’s provoking unrest\nAnd if we stay, we must build a new order\nAn impossible task\nFor democracy cannot be birthed in a day\nAnd if we leave, we leave chaos\nA mess for them to clean up\nOh, this is a thorny topic\nI’m at a loss\nWar in Iraq\nUgh\nMmm\nUhh I don’t know\nDo you have another question I can address?\nOk\nThank you\nWell\nI think\nI think the war should persist\nNot because of the fighting\nBut to assert our might\nOur guns, our power\nBut not a war in the traditional sense\nFor it was never declared by Congress\nIt’s not a proper war\nI don’t think it should be called one\nFor it was a response\nAnd yet, I think we should stay\nTo help them\nBut our resources are stretched thin\nAnd Bush, he’s taking the brunt of it\nA black mark on his presidency\nLike Vietnam, an undeclared war\nA meaningless conflict\nAnd he’ll bear the weight\nOf his decision\nHmm\nIt’s a half-hour, isn’t it?\nUh\nYeah\nWell\nI suppose you could say\nIt’s hard to call for an end\nFor there are families, sons and daughters\nIn harm's way\nAnd we’ve disrupted their lives\nAnd now, schools are unsafe\nAnd factions clash\nOver belief and culture\nYet, our presence may only fuel the fire\nThe hatred towards us\nAnd Al-Qaida will grow stronger\nFor they see our imposition\nAs an affront\nA totalitarian regime, a dictatorship\nAnd if we remain, we only deepen the chasm\nBetween them and us\nIt’ll go on, year after year\nHmm\nThat’s about all I can offer",
            "Uh\nIt's just not right, I reckon, to make it legal or for any state to declare it so. It's a matter for the churches, damn it, seeing as the Constitution itself says plain and clear there's a separation between church and state.\n\nIt's written in stone, it is. Trying to enforce any kind of power over it would be defying what's already been laid down. I think them pushing for it to be illegal is like choosing one church's belief over another. Catholics, most of them, they're against it. It's not for the government to decide what the churches can and can't make illegal, is it?\n\nSeparation of church and state, that's been a cornerstone of this here constitution. Making an amendment about it, I reckon that would be wrong. It would be going against what's already been said and written. Plus, it'd be one of the only amendments used to restrict the people, not the government. It's just not right, damn it.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government or any other government should be involved in this. I reckon he's pushing for this amendment just because it's against his own beliefs as a Catholic. It's like he's showing a preference for one religion over another. It should be up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any other government official.\n\nThere ain't no real reason behind this amendment except for his personal views. It ain't gonna impact the economy or society in no way. If anything, it might have a better impact on society than leaving it the way it is. I reckon that's about all I got to say on the matter.",
            "The war in Iraq, it began. A shroud of dishonesty, it was. The government, they said we'd find weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. They played on our grief, our outrage, our desire for vengeance. The invasion, 2003, it came.\n\nI, I was against it. War, it's a cruel beast, and I've seen its handiwork. The Vietnam War, it echoes. We removed their government, but chaos followed. We didn't plan for it, not properly. We planted a democratic seed, like in Vietnam, but it wouldn't grow without sun and rain, without time.\n\nSoldiers, they died. Too many. The government, they sang a different tune, said it'd be quick and clean. But it's been years, and still, we're there. Still, they're dying. We're training Iraqis, but it's slow. Democracy, it doesn't grow overnight, not even in our own land.\n\nThe oil, it's the root. That's why we're there. We control their resources, like we've always done. North Korea, it has weapons, and we do nothing. The government, they're not being truthful, not being thorough. They see dollar signs, not people.\n\nThe election, 2004, I thought about it. Bush, he started something. How can we abandon them now? We took their government, their way of life. But at what cost? American lives, they're precious. How much is too much?\n\nIt's a difficult decision, to leave. We must consider the future. But we must also consider the past, the present. The war, it's a monster, and it won't be easy to tame.\n\nI hope for peace, but I doubt it. It's a long road, and it's just begun.",
            "Let me see now, I reckon. I've always been in favor of that there gay marriage. Always have. It's a personal matter, a choice, you understand? Something that's a part of who a person is, not some stain on their soul. It ain't right to take away rights from folks for something they ain't got control over.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I ain't saying it's all black and white. There's always a gray area, but I believe it's about love, pure and simple. I've seen it with my own eyes. In my neighborhood, there's a few couples, two or three, they're gay, ain't married 'cause they ain't allowed. But they're just like any other family, walkin' their dogs, livin' their lives. It ain't right what Bush was tryin' to do, playin' God with his interpretation of marriage.\n\nIt's a personal thing, not somethin' the government should have a hand in. It's between two people, not the whole nation. I've read it myself, it's somethin' in your brain, a predisposition. It ain't about the way you were raised, it's who you are. It's like the difference between the way a man and a woman are made. It's biology, not sociology.\n\nAnd another thing, it's a private matter, not somethin' everyone needs to know about. If a man and a woman want to get hitched, they can just up and go to Las Vegas. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's big news. It's like they're some kind of spectacle. It's their life, their choice. It's time we let them live it in peace.\n\nNo, it ain't right what's been goin' on. It's not right to deny folks their rights just because they're different. It's time we stand up for what's right.",
            "Listen, I reckon you're aware of this, but let me spell it out for you. When you put something on the internet, you're making it public. As plain as day. No more hiding behind a wall of anonymity. I spoke on this very matter once, when I was an R.A. It's a fact of life, this internet business.\n\nNow, why, you ask, should you be so cautious? Well, consider this: if you're putting out there that you're about to blow things up, or pull a trigger, someone's gonna take notice. And they'll do something about it. Because the internet, it's not just for you and your friends. It's a vast, open plain, where everybody and their dog can be watching.\n\nI recall a time when something was overheard at school. Someone said something, and it was taken seriously. Why? Because the internet's no place for foolishness or jesting. It's a serious business, and what you say can have serious consequences. A sociology experiment gone wrong, maybe. Or perhaps something more dire.\n\nLet me tell you, the internet's a double-edged sword. You put something out there, you're inviting the world to see it. If you don't want it seen, don't put it there. It's as simple as that. You can't dictate what people think or how they take things. You can't control their reactions.\n\nNow, I ain't saying school officials should be snooping around, poking through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those social media contraptions. But if it's brought to their attention, that's a different ballgame. If there's danger, they gotta take it seriously. It's their duty.\n\nYou see, it's all about the line between what's private and what's public. And when it comes to the internet, that line gets mighty thin. So, think before you post. Because out there, in the wide-open internet, there's no hiding.",
            "The conflict has stretched on for an ungodly amount of time, a stain upon the earth that seems to have lost its purpose. Initially, the cause was noble - to restore democracy in a land ravaged by tyranny. But the motives have long since been sullied, like the rain in a drought-stricken land. The wind of war has turned into a howling gale, and we are no longer the lighthouse but the storm itself.\n\nThe war began with a clear purpose, a beacon of righteousness. But like the moon's shadow on the earth, it has grown long and twisted, a shadow of its former self. The initial purpose, to liberate the oppressed, has been eclipsed by a new purpose, one of power and domination. It is as if we are now waging war for the sake of war, a beast that feeds on itself and its own.\n\nThe road to war was paved with the bones of men and the blood of nations. It was once a path of righteousness, to stand against a tyrant. But the path has become a maze, a labyrinth of deceit and greed. We are no longer the saviors we once believed ourselves to be. We are the storm that does not abate, the rain that does not cease.\n\nThe war has become a drain on our very existence, a leech that feeds upon our economy. The money meant for our own shores, for our own people, is being spent in a foreign land, a land that may never know the touch of democracy. It is a blight upon our land, a cancer that must be excised.\n\nThe time has come for the war to end. The officials of that land must stand on their own two feet, as we must stand on ours. We cannot be the crutch that props up nations, for it is a crutch that will lead us to our own downfall. The money spent upon this war is a debt that will never be repaid, a debt that will lead to our own ruin.\n\nThe war must end. It is a futile, endless struggle, a battle that can never be won. It is a war that is no longer worth fighting. It is a war that we must leave behind, like a ghost that haunts a empty house. The time has come to turn our backs on war, to turn our faces towards home.",
            "Well, if I may, I'd like to inquire about this matter. I reckon it was averted due to someone uncannily stumbling upon certain information online. Now, I ain't one to insist on privacy, especially not on these here social sites like Myspace. If you put your life out there, for all the world to see, well, that's on you. It's like opening the gates to your own private sanctum. You might think you're sharing your life with friends, but you're also inviting the scrutiny of strangers. It's a double-edged sword, that's for sure. Now, I ain't got no Myspace myself, but I have me a Facebook. I've seen some sketchy characters out there, lurking in the shadows. I've seen how a person can dig up information like a coyote digging up a rabbit. They can find your name, talk to you, and before you know it, they're asking you to meet. I wouldn't do it, but some of my classmates, they ain't so careful. They don't know who they're talking to, or what they're giving away. It's a tricky business, all right. I only accept people I know, but you never know who might be watching. My roommate told me about her high school days, where they were banned from having Myspace. I reckon that's a bit harsh. I mean, how can they tell folks what they can't do? It ain't right, I tell you. It's a thorny issue, but I reckon it's one we all gotta navigate.",
            "Damn, I reckon we got ourselves in quite the pickle here. The Iraq War, it's been a godforsaken mess from the get-go. I feel like a right son of a bitch talking about it, like I'm just riding the wave of them who were against it from day one. But, hell, it doesn't matter much now, does it? The whole world's seen that it was a bad idea, even our own troops over there think we should be pulling out sooner rather than later. It's a goddamn disaster, and pulling out ain't gonna be no easier.\n\nI mean, look at the polls, will ya? Seventy-five, eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of our own troops. It's a goddamn consensus. It's like trying to force a square peg into a round hole. We're trying to bring democracy to a place where it don't belong, and it ain't gonna work. Saddam was a bastard, sure, but we should've weighed the pros and cons before we stomped in there. It was like dancing with the devil, and now we're up to our eyeballs in quicksand.\n\nI don't even know what to make of it all. I sure as hell ain't seen no good reason for us to stay any longer than we should. The administration? They're probably cooking up some hopeful ideas, but I ain't buying it. I've yet to hear a single legitimate reason for staying. If they want to do it gradually, over a year or two, I guess I could stomach it. But why should we stay now? Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, even a quarter of them want us to leave right now. These are the people we're trying to save, and they're telling us to fuck off. Maybe they know better than we do.\n\nAnd if we leave, what then? We'll be the goddamn good guys, won't we? Not really. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we won't be the ones who fucked it all up. We'll be the ones who tried to do what was right. But, who's to say they won't see us as the devils we are? No matter what we do, they'll always hate us.",
            "In these United States of ours, the specter of gender discrimination looms large. It cuts not merely along the lines of sex, but also carves deep into the very fabric of our societal tapestry. In the realm of labor, women, despite their qualifications, often find themselves trapped beneath an invisible glass ceiling, a relic of our collective past that shackles them to lesser positions. This is not to say that men are exempt; they too are not immune to the scourge of discrimination, be it in fashion, where the male figure is often overlooked, or in the domestic sphere, where the stay-at-home father is met with derision and scorn.\n\nThe path to change, however, is a labyrinth of slow progress. We have come far from the dark days of yore, but the march towards equality is a tortoise's pace. The women who claw their way to the upper echelons of business, and the men who choose to nurture their families rather than toil in the fields, are but the vanguard, their success stories slowly chipping away at the old notions that once dominated our minds.\n\nYet, change is also a double-edged sword. It must be wielded with care, lest it provoke a backlash. For every step forward, there are those who resist, who cling to the old ways, who see the new order as a threat to their own. It is a delicate dance, this progression, a slow ballet of acceptance and rejection. And so, we tread carefully, promoting the virtues of those who challenge the status quo, not by force, but by example. For in the end, it is not the loudest voice that wins, but the one that resonates, the one that touches the heart.\n\nBut discrimination, it seems, is not the sole domain of gender. It lurks in the shadows of our backgrounds, our upbringing, our speech. A man from the farm, his grammar rough, may find his intelligence undercut by his roots. His words, like his hands, bear the stigmata of his past, and some will find it difficult to see beyond the surface, to recognize the intellect within. The gendered gaze, then, is but one facet of a larger problem, one that afflicts us all.",
            "Well, they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it, knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more akin to a traffic ticket. You get cited, not booked and arrested. No more of that. And for young folks, the future ramifications are what they worry about. They don't go away, not completely. But there's a cost to all this, you know? Arresting, booking, housing, all of it. And the court dates, the public defenders, the judges, the state's attorney, it all adds up. Municipalities, especially those strapped for cash, they're not inclined to make that kind of concession, even if it'd free up a lot of money to spend on things they really need, like education, social programs, food for the homeless. I mean, it's not like we want marijuana to be everywhere, on every corner. And there are reasons why it shouldn't be. I don't know how I'd feel about it being like cigarettes, sold everywhere, smoked everywhere. It's still taboo in a lot of places. And it's not like either substance is completely harmless. Some people react differently, some people can handle it, some can't. It's not that simple. But I guess what I'm saying is, both have their own adverse effects. But I don't know.",
            "I would say yes, for I have witnessed much that is traditional in these matters, as if time itself has little sway upon their actions. It is good to be rooted, to remain steadfast in ways that have been handed down through generations. Yet, it is also vital to be adaptable, to find the balance between the old and the new. In this, the Catholic Church finds itself in a peculiar state. The weekly gathering, the rituals, the strict adherence to doctrine - these are not without their merit. Yet, there is a coldness in the way they view those who do not conform to their teachings, a lack of tolerance for the beliefs of others. It seems hypocritical, for we are taught to love all, yet are told to shun those who do not share our faith. My father, an Episcopalian, was refused the sacraments because of his belief. This is not tolerance, but divisiveness. The doctrine speaks of love, yet the practice is steeped in the dated trappings of centuries past. It is a struggle to reconcile the two.\n\nYet, I do not believe this would necessarily influence the behavior of those who have fallen so gravely from grace. The molestation of children is not a matter of marital status, but a dark seed that has taken root in the soul. A priest's marriage would not change the nature of his transgressions, for his actions are not born of conjugal relations, but of his own twisted heart. Allowing priests to marry would not prevent such horrors, for they are not the product of marital status, but of the depravity of the individual. It is a different realm entirely.",
            "I find myself at a crossroads, not yet firm in my stance on this contentious issue. The matter of church and state's separation, and the definition of marriage, is a labyrinth of thorny complexities that lie at the heart of our modern society. It is a tangled web, one that demands careful navigation to avoid offending those who walk its precarious path.\n\nI am of the opinion that marriage, in its secular form, should be recognized as a civil union. After all, what is marriage but a union of two souls, regardless of their beliefs or the rituals that bind them? If we are to maintain a separation of church and state, then the government should not delve into the intricacies of marriage, be it religious or otherwise. It is a union, a contract between two people, and no more.\n\nIf each state were to arrive at a consensus, then by all means, let them push for federal recognition. Yet, amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage is an absurdity. Such an amendment would be a stain on the sacred document we hold dear, a stain that would be remembered for generations to come. It is a cause that may be important to some, but it is not vital enough to warrant such a drastic measure. The constitution should not be amended for the sake of a single, albeit passionate, minority.\n\nSo, no, I cannot say that I support such an amendment. It goes against the very spirit of our nation, a spirit that was forged in the fires of diversity and tolerance.",
            "In the crucible of my youth, I was forged in a home sanctified by the teachings of a certain faith. The matter of homosexuality, then, is a labyrinthine conundrum, for I have known many friends whose hearts are inclined in ways that differ from the norm. Though I may not align with their path, I contend that this should not be a matter of national import but a matter of state's discretion. The republic is a tapestry woven with various hues, each state a distinct thread, and no single leader should presume to dictate the moral fabric of all. The winds of change can shift with the election of a new president, and I see no benefit in this back and forth, in this political whirlwind. It is the state, the people, who will bear the consequences of their decision, not the transient figure at the helm of the nation. So let it be. Let each state decide. Let the people's will be done.",
            "Well, now, I ain't got much to say on the matter, but let me spin this yarn real slow for ya.\n\nMyspace, it's a public thing, ain't it? A bulletin board, so to speak. When you put somethin' out there, you're puttin' it out there for the world to see, not just the school officials. But if they're lookin' out for the students' safety, well, ain't that their job? To keep 'em safe, to make that school a better place? Now, if they catch wind of a student postin' somethin' they shouldn't be, well, that's their responsibility, ain't it? If it's about keepin' the school safe, I can't see the harm in that.\n\nBut, if they're just snoopin' 'round, tryin' to catch students in trouble, that's a different story. That's pryin' into kids' private business. But if it's to keep 'em safe, to save lives, well, that's somethin' else entirely. It's all about the bigger picture, you see?\n\nI reckon it's a lot easier to express yourself writin' than talkin'. But the point is, it's a public thing. You post somethin' on there, you can't expect to get off scot-free. It's out there, for the world to see. And once it's out there, it's there forever. Can't unsee it, can't unread it. And if you're doin' somethin' you shouldn't be, well, that's gonna bite you in the ass sooner or later.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' they should go snoopin' around, just to catch students. But if they have somethin' that leads 'em to believe they need to make the school safer, well, then, I figure they're just doin' their job. It's all about makin' sure the kids are safe, ain't it? Just like we had drills for the terrorist attacks, to keep the school safe. That's what they were doin' here, just makin' sure nothin' bad happens, like what happened at Columbine.\n\nThat's about all I can say on the matter.",
            "In the wake of the unforgiving storm that was Nine-Eleven, I was consumed by a fervor that burned like coal in the heart of a desert. I was for it - the war - not so much for the ideals it purported to uphold, but for the raw, unbridled emotion that gripped the nation. I was, in a sense, a man possessed, driven by a thirst for retribution that blurred the lines of reason.\n\nAt first, I envisioned a swift and decisive strike, a brutal retaliation that would leave its mark indelibly on those who had dared to strike at our shores. But the passage of time, and the grim realities of war, have tempered that initial ardor. I now see that our entry into this conflict was akin to a drunkard stumbling into a fight, not knowing what awaits him in the darkness beyond the door.\n\nThe people of that land, they are not like us. They are a people forged in the crucible of ancient hatreds and ancient wars. Their war is not a noble pursuit, but a dance of death, a grim ritual where the sacred and the profane are one and the same. They fight not for a better future, but for a past that has long since passed, a past that is as much their curse as it is their pride.\n\nWe went in blind, driven by anger and a desire for vengeance. We did not know the terrain, nor the minds of our foes. We were like a bull charging into a maze, expecting to find a clear path, only to find ourselves lost and alone. And all the while, the people of that land remained divided, their infighting a symphony of chaos that drowned out the cries of the few who would have welcomed us as allies.\n\nOur presence there, it is a temporary salve on a wound that will not heal. It is a bandage over a festering infection. We are not the doctors who will heal this land, but merely the strangers arriving to tend to the dying. And in our haste, in our haste to act, we have forgotten the most basic tenet of war: to know thine enemy.\n\nI no longer seek to change the hearts of those people. I have come to realize that they are not like us, and never will be. They are a people locked in a cycle of violence, a cycle as old as time itself. We cannot impose our order on their chaos, for it is a chaos that has defined them for generations.\n\nThe longer we stay, the more we become entangled in their fate. And for what? To impose our will upon a people who will never accept it? To create an order where there is only chaos? It is a fool's errand, a futile pursuit that will only lead to our own undoing.\n\nI am no longer a man consumed by anger and a desire for vengeance. I am a man who has seen the absurdity of war, who has seen the futility of our efforts. I am a man who has come to realize that there are some battles that cannot be won, some wars that cannot be fought. And this is one of them."
