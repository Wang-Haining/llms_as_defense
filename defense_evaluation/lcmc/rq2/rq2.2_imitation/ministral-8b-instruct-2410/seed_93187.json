            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In this day and age, the Catholic Church finds itself at a crossroads, its once steadfast flock beginning to waver. The reasons for this, I believe, lie within the Church's unyielding stance on matters that have evolved with time. The institution has always been steadfast in its views on matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views, while firm and rooted in tradition, are not always in tune with the shifting sentiments of the modern world.\n\nThe Church's rigid stance on such issues has caused some to question its relevance and has led many to seek solace elsewhere. The younger generations, in particular, are turning away from the Church because they do not share its views on these subjects. The Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, can be a barrier for those who believe in the right to choose. Similarly, its stance against same-sex marriage can be a hurdle for those who wish to celebrate their love openly and legally.\n\nI am not advocating for the complete abandonment of these traditional views, but rather for a more nuanced approach that can accommodate the diverse beliefs and values of its followers. The Church's insistence that priests dedicate their lives to God, forsaking worldly pleasures and attachments, is a noble mission. However, it is not without its drawbacks. The Church's ban on marriage for priests, for example, can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which may not be conducive to the well-being of the clergy.\n\nThe Church's history is filled with tales of its leaders, both good and bad, and it is impossible to say with certainty whether a more permissive stance on marriage and female ordination would have prevented the scandals that have shaken the Church's foundations. It is a complex issue, one that cannot be simplified into a single solution. However, it is clear that the Church must engage with these questions openly and honestly, for the sake of its future.",
            "Well, now.\n\nMe, personally, I ain't got no problem with that here.\n\nSeems to me like it's not somethin' one can just choose, like a hat or a drink. Born that way, or whatever. Ain't no choice in the matter.\n\nSo, I reckon it's high time we stop holdin' folks accountable for somethin' they can't help, like the color of their eyes or the slope of their nose. Same goes for the way they're drawn to others. It's just the way they are, like the land or the weather. Ain't right to say one can and one can't, just 'cause they're different.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' I've give this here topic much thought. But I know what I know. And it seems to me like it's wrong to say a man can wed a woman, but two folks of the same stripe can't. Just don't make no sense.\n\nAnd the federal government? They got their hands full with the big stuff, like keepin' us safe and all. Ain't their place to meddle in folks' private lives and decisions. It's like a judge tryin' to teach a fly how to fly. Just don't work that way.\n\nSo, leave them be. They're just folks, same as the rest of us. Born that way, and they shouldn't be punished for it. That's all there is to it.",
            "I reckon that legalizing gay marriage is a notion that bears consideration, even if some see it as a threat to traditional unions. The arguments against it are many, yet they pale in comparison to the simple truth that love is love, regardless of whom it embraces. Many believe that homosexual couples are an abomination, a perversion of nature, but this is a stance born of ignorance and fear, not fact. The children of such unions, they say, will be raised in a shadow, their moral compass skewed by the unorthodox nature of their parents. But what of the countless studies that have shown no difference in the success of these unions compared to their heterosexual counterparts? The idea that gay couples will raise their children to be flawed, broken, is a fallacy. The role of a parent is not defined by their sexual orientation but by their love, guidance, and the values they instill in their children. The government, too, should not be a arbiter of such intimate matters. It is a matter of civil rights, of equality under the law. To deny one group these rights is to perpetuate segregation, separate but unequal. The federal government should step in, not to impose its will, but to ensure that all citizens are treated as such, regardless of who they choose to love. The moral high ground is not the exclusive domain of any one religion or culture. It is a shared responsibility, a collective effort to create a society that values compassion, understanding, and equality. To deny the rights of others based on their sexual orientation is to deny the very essence of what it means to be American.",
            "Well, first off, I tend the pharmacy over the summer, just like I tend to the dying in the night. Now, Jus' cause somethin' is illegal don't mean it ain't got its uses. I've seen the likes of oxycodone and vicodin run through here, and they're as beneficial as they are controlled. But I'd say, no, I'd say we shouldn't be just tossin' it out there for the public, like a pack of wild dogs. No, no, but for medicinal purposes? Absolutely, I'd say yes. Just 'cause a drug is illegal don't make it less so. It's not beneficial, no sir.\n\nYou see, there's a world of drugs out there, like a pack of wolves waitin' to be let loose. Oxycodone, vicodin, percocets, they're all just as dangerous as the next. But we use 'em 'cause they've got a purpose. And if you deny that purpose just 'cause there's a stigma 'round marijuana, well, that's like lettin' a good dog starve. You should embrace its benefits, I reckon.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's the same as alcohol, but neither is it nothin' like heroine or cocaine. It's just... different.

            "Well, the church has seen a shift in the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it once was. When I was younger, I'd go every Sunday, dressed in cute little dresses and matching shoes, seeing all my friends in the same attire. Now, they've introduced a teenager's mass, cut down to thirty minutes, and the dress code has relaxed significantly. People show up in beachwear during summer, families come late, and even the morning masses have seen a casual turn. People wear jeans and khakis now, which, to be honest, is quite practical but far removed from the pristine outfits of old. As for the church's politics or the scandals involving priests, I don't know the ins and outs, but I don't think changes like allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the pedophilia accusations. Men who are married can still be attracted to children, and it's not just a matter of being allowed or not. It's a matter of wanting to serve the church and potentially not being suited for it. There are other faiths that allow marriage, so those who want to practice their faith and be married should consider other paths. I believe the attraction to children is often genetic and not entirely a result of upbringing. You can't change someone's genetics through marriage, and if they know about it and cover it up, that's shameful, but I think not all instances were known. Other than that, I have no further thoughts on the matter.",
            "It was all well and good at first, I suppose. But with the echoes of September eleventh still ringing in our ears, we found ourselves in a land far from our shores, waging war on a premise that would soon unravel like a cheap tapestry. The Iraq war, a specter that haunts our collective consciousness, was a pretext, a mirage that led us astray. The Bush administration, with its litany of falsehoods, weaved a web of deceit, asserting that Saddam Hussein's regime was a threat, that weapons of mass destruction lurked within his grasp. Yet, the truth was as elusive as the morning mist, and the arm of justice has yet to reach out and grasp the Bush administration's neck.\n\nColin Powell, once a voice of authority, now echoes in the chambers of shame, confessing his doubts, his misgivings. He, like many, believed the lies, the half-truths, the deceptions. The Constitution, a sacred text, was trampled upon, its words twisted, its intent derided. The Bush administration, it seems, entered office with a dark purpose, a vengeance that burned like a fever, a desire to expand, to control.\n\nThe war drags on, a festering wound on the face of humanity. Withdrawal, a thought that sends a shiver down the spine, would be akin to leaving a child in the dark, a lamb in the jaws of a wolf. Civil war, a specter that looms large, would take its toll, a harvest of blood and tears. The coalition, a motley crew of nations, would step into the breach, but can they restore order in a land where the very fabric of government dissolves like sand between our fingers?\n\nThe interim government, a fragile construct, crumbles under the weight of its own instability. The Prime Minister, a shadow of his former self, struggles to maintain control over the political process, a raging river that threatens to sweep him away. The Parliament, a fractious body, is but a reflection of the chaos that reigns. And the radicals, those who once fought against us, now hold sway, a testament to the turmoil that grips the heart of Iraq.\n\nNone of this is the world we wanted to see. Yet, it is the world we inhabit, a land of shadows and uncertainty.",
            "I did just as the wind does, in a breath. Aye, there's the matter of the Iraq War. I reckon it's become a point of contention, like a bone between two hounds. The war, it wasn't declared by Congress, you see. It was a matter of retribution, a strike against them who we figured planted the seeds of the eleven's horror. Now, I ain't one to keep track of such things, but I know we're there to build a democracy, to mold 'em in our image. Oil, too, plays its part, but I think it's a fool's errand. They're a people with a different way, and we're trying to force our hand upon them. It's like trying to bend a river, it only serves to create a flood. We should withdraw, let's not prolong their agony and our own. It's a tricky thing, this war. It's not fair, but it's a fact. We should let them find their own way, not force our own upon them.

            "I don't see fit to make it so, for the state to declare it legal, or even to legalize it at all. I believe the churches should have their say, as the Constitution itself stands witness to the separation of church and state. It is plainly stated, and I believe any attempt to wield power over it would be tantamount to defying what has been written in stone. In the eyes of those who seek to make it illegal, it seems they are imposing one belief over another, as the majority of Catholics and Christians are against it, save for a few pockets like Boston. I don't see it as the government's place to decide what is legal and illegal for the churches. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our Constitution, a beacon for religious tolerance. To add an amendment on this matter would be a contradiction to what is already in place, and quite possibly the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. It is not right. I do not believe the federal government, nor any government, should involve itself in this matter. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, revealing a preference for one religion over others. This is not a matter for the president or any government official. There is no sound reasoning behind this amendment save for personal views. It won't impact the economy, and I believe it could even have a positive impact on society. I've said my piece.",
            "The war in Iraq... It began with a lie, a deceit woven into the very fabric of our nation's decision to march into that foreign land. The government, they said, had weapons of mass destruction, a threat to our very existence. But it was a lie, a tale spun to rouse the emotions of a people still raw from the scars of September 11th. The government, they said, would liberate the Iraqis, bring them democracy. Yet, they were not prepared, not at all.\n\nThe war was a repeat, a echo of the Vietnam War, a war of insurgents and citizen soldiers. The government, they should have known better, should have learned from the past. But they were blind, blinded by the oil, blinded by the money. They removed the government, but they were not ready for what came next, the chaos, the void of power. They tried to plant democracy, but it was a long and hard process, a process that our own country had struggled through, a struggle of tension and civil war.\n\nAnd now, years later, we are still there, still dying, still trying to train the Iraqis, to teach them how to police their own country. The government, they were not prepared, not at all. They tried to deceive us, make us believe it would be a quick and easy victory. But it was not, it was a long and hard battle, a battle that was not won, not truly won.\n\nThe war in Iraq, it was a difficult decision, a decision that still weighs heavily on my mind. I would have voted for Bush, to let him finish what he started. But now, how can we abandon them? We took their government, their way of life. How can we abandon them now? But there is also the consideration, the awful consideration of the American casualties, the American blood spilled for a cause that would never truly be won.\n\nAnd the oil, the oil, it was the reason, the true reason. It was all about the money, the resources. It was not about democracy, not truly. Why Iraq and not North Korea, with their weapons of mass destruction? It was the oil, the oil that fueled our decisions, that guided our hands.\n\nLet the war end, let the peace come. But it will not be soon, not truly.",
            "Well, now, let's see here. I reckon I've always been in favor of the notion of gay marriage. It's a personal thing, plain and simple. I think it's a matter of biology more than sociology, and denying folks the right to marry based on something they can't control seems plain inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for it, you see.\n\nI don't think politics or the government ought to have a say in it. It's a personal affair, not something the state or federal government needs to be involved with. Look at my neighborhood, for instance. We've got a couple of openly gay couples, and they're just like any other family. They walk their dogs, tend to their gardens, and mind their own business. It's just the way it ought to be.\n\nNow, I've read and heard from numerous sources that there's a biological aspect to being homosexual. It's not just about growing up in a certain environment or having a certain upbringing. It's something innate, something that's been proven time and time again.\n\nAnd let's talk about marriage, shall we? If a man and a woman want to get hitched, they can just up and do it without telling a soul. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's front-page news. I think that's just wrong. Marriage should be a private matter, not something for the public or the government to dictate.\n\nNo, I don't think it's right to deny folks the right to marry because of their sexual orientation. It's a personal choice, and it's nobody else's business.",

You can't just go spewing whatever you please about blowing things up or shootings, think about it. Someone's gonna take it the wrong way. The internet's a public forum, and you can't control how people interpret your words. It's like a wildfire, once it starts, there's no telling where it'll end up.\n\nI've seen it myself, where someone overhears something at school and goes running to the authorities. They can't just let it be, not when lives are on the line. But here's the thing, you can't tell what's real and what's just fooling around. It could be a sociology experiment gone wrong, or it could be a real threat. One time, we had someone who was overheard saying something, and when we looked into it, we found they had posted things on their Facebook that seemed serious, even if they were meant as jokes. You can't predict how people will react.\n\nNow, I ain't saying schools should be snooping on students' social media accounts. But if something's brought to their attention, they've got a duty to take it seriously. It's about safety, plain and simple. If it's a real threat, they can't just ignore it. And as for teachers, they shouldn't be sneaking around on social media, pretending to be someone they ain't. That's just creepy. But if a student brings something to their attention, that's different. They've given them access to their online world, and it's only right they take it seriously.\n\nSo, my advice? Think before you post. Don't put things out there that you don't want people to see. Because once it's out there, it's out there. And you can't control what people think or how they react. It's like writing in the sand, you never know who might see it, or how they'll interpret it.",
            "In the quietude of the American night, the war drags on, a relentless river of blood and sand. It was a noble purpose, once, to restore democracy to a land shrouded in tyranny. But as the years bleed into one another, the original intent fades, like a ghost in the desert sun. We wage this conflict now, not for the sake of freedom, but to prove our might, to be the unchallenged colossus of the world. And what of Motive? Who can say if the embers of our resolve were not fanned by the ghosts of old debts, the embers of George Bush Senior's enmity with Saddam Hussein? If the purpose was to bestow democracy on a land devoid of fair governance, then so be it. But if personal grievances were the true currency, then we find ourselves adrift, drunk on the blood of innocents.\n\nWe have sent our purpose into the world, like a clarion call, in the first months of this war. But now, as the years stretch on, the clarity of that purpose dissolves. This is not a war of principle, but a war of will, a stubborn refusal to admit defeat or concede defeat. We do not want to retreat, tarnished and battered, without a decisive end, a final, triumphant cry.\n\nThe war has gone on long enough. Too long. The government of Iraq must now stand on its own, as we once did. Our resources are not endless, and every dollar spent on this foreign conflict is a dollar not spent on our own war, the war against poverty, the war to heal our own lands. The roads that crumble, the schools that fail, the hospitals that lack, they are the battlegrounds of our time, and they deserve more than the crumbs we offer them.\n\nWe have spent billions, and the war is not something to be woven into the fabric of our budget, like a decoration on a grand tapestry. There are battles to be fought at home, and they need our attention, our resources, our resolve. We cannot afford to bleed on foreign soil while our own needs go unmet. For in the end, it is our own land that will bear the scars of this war, our own people who will feel the sting of our withdrawal, our own economy that will recoil from the drain of this endless struggle.",
            "Can I inquire, perhaps, if I might clarify a matter?\n\nI suppose the fact is, it was averted through the intervention of an individual who, by happenstance, chanced upon the information online.\n\nWell, now, that's the crux of the matter, ain't it? If one chooses to put forth personal tidings on the internet, then it's fair to say the world may as well have a peek.\n\nTake Myspace, for instance. You see, it's no secret that to view another's profile, one must first accept them as a \"friend.\" It's a covenant, if you will. But once that bond is forged, it's akin to giving them a key to your own personal sanctum.\n\nNow, it's a curious conundrum, isn't it? For we know well that by sharing our lives online, we invite a multitude of eyes to gaze upon our secrets. And who can say if any of those eyes may harbor ill intent?\n\nI, myself, have not delved into the realms of Myspace, but Facebook, now that's a different matter. I'll wager it's akin to walking through a market square, where one can't help but catch a glimpse of the wares laid bare for all to see.\n\nIt troubles me, this knowledge that there are those who lurk in the shadows, snooping about like vultures. I've heard tales of men who, with naught but a few clicks, can unmask your true name and weave a web of deceit. It's a precarious dance, this life in the digital age.\n\nI've come across instances where individuals in my classes, whose faces I know not, have sent me messages, knowing full well who I am. They have seen my interests laid bare, my daily schedule laid out like a map. It's a disquieting feeling, to know that one's most private thoughts are accessible to the public.\n\nBut I suppose there's a balance to be struck. For while I limit what I share, I also wish to remain connected with those I hold dear. It's a delicate line to walk, this journey through the digital frontier.\n\nI've heard tell that in some high schools, they've forbidden students from having Myspace accounts altogether. It strikes me as a peculiar notion, that those who ought to be guiding us could dictate what we may or may not do in our personal lives.\n\nI reckon it's a matter of privacy, and perhaps a question of power. But I'm not one to speak on such matters with any certainty. It's a world that's ever-changing, this digital realm, and we're but mere pioneers, forging our way through uncharted territories.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and then one more time that I must speak on the Iraq War\nUm\nYes\nI mean, I feel hypocritical discussing it\nI mean, I hate to say, you know\nI hate to join the bandwagon of those who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but like it’s not really important anymore\nCause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t care to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nThey’ve done Iraqi polls\nThey’ve done global polls\nAnd I mean, no, like about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops that are over there\nLike the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in\nIt was already a disaster\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s just too big a gap and for administrations past and present to understand\nAnd they think that they can just like bring Democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean, sure Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s arguing that he’s not\nBut, I mean, you have to weight the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to\nYou know turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these\nThese are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know, if it completely goes to shit we could be like well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean, if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than you know where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Damn, the world's still a godforsaken mess when it comes to how we treat each other based on our sex. It's a long road to walk, full of hard knocks and twisted paths. Men and women, we're all just trying to carve out a place for ourselves, but the game's rigged, and the deck's stacked against us.\n\nTake, for instance, the business world. It's still a man's world, and women have to walk a mile in their shoes just to prove they're worth their salt. They've got the qualifications, the brains, and the guts, but the board won't budge, not because they're not good enough, but because society's still stuck in the dusty past. The glass ceiling's still up there, and it's not about to shatter anytime soon.\n\nAnd it's not just about women. Men, too, have their own battles to fight. In fields like fashion, where the world's already got a certain image in its mind, men can't break the mold. They're met with raised eyebrows and skeptical glances. \"How can a man know fashion?\" they'll ask. \"Isn't that a woman's thing?\"\n\nSociety's mindset's like a stubborn mule, and changing it's no easy task. It's a slow, painful process, but we're making progress. Women are rising to the top, taking on CEO positions, and it's starting to click for some people. Men staying at home, raising the kids, it's not the norm, but it's becoming more accepted. They're realizing, hey, maybe the woman's the breadwinner this time around.\n\nBut the fight's not just about sex. It's about class, about where you come from. A man from a farm, with his hands calloused and his grammar rough, he's got to fight twice as hard to prove he's got what it takes. Other men, they won't look at him straight, not with his words all twisted up. It's a goddamn shame, but it's the truth.\n\nWe've come a long way, but the road's far from over. Change's a slow, steady thing, like the tide coming in. It's not about forcing it, it's about showing the good in people, the qualities that make them shine. It's about patience, about time. And hope, too. We've got to keep fighting, keep pushing, keep chipping away at the old ways. Because, dammit, we deserve better. We all do.",
            "Well,\nThey didn't so much legalize it as they did decriminalize it. Knocked it down from a criminal offense, like a pebble tumbling from a mountain to a mere traffic infraction. A citation, a slap on the wrist, rather than the cuffs and the cell. As the kid put it, \"a ticket's what you get now, not a trip to the lockup.\" And I reckon that's where the real trouble starts. Job interviews, college applications, all those future prospects tainted by a mark on your record. A stain harder to wash out than blood from the floorboards of a saloon. But there's more to it than that. Costs money, it does, to arrest someone, book 'em, feed 'em, defend 'em. And then there's the court, the lawyers, the whole circus. A municipality on the brink, how much can they afford to spend on something like this? And then there's the philosophies, the morals, the \"liberal\" sentiments. Denver, it's different there. More open, more money to spend on education, social programs, aid for the poor. But it ain't for everyone. Marijuana, it's not something you want everywhere, all the time. It's a tricky business, this legalization. It's like trying to tame a storm. Some folks say it's a slippery slope, others say it's long overdue. But one thing's for sure, it's a storm that's brewing. And the wind's picking up.",
            "I would say yes, for the sake of tradition, yes, but also for the sake of adaptability, yes. A lot of the Catholic ways are as old as the hills, deeply rooted and unchanged for centuries. And I suppose tradition, well, it's like the roots of an ancient oak - it keeps us grounded. But we must also be like the willow, bending with the wind, adapting to change. Yet, there are those who cling to the doctrine like a drowning man to a splinter.\n\nMany a Catholic believes they must attend church weekly, and they're rigid in their rituals. The Church, it seems, doesn't take kindly to those who deviate from the straight and narrow. They turn away those who aren't perfect, and those of other religions, it seems, are as unwelcome as a stranger in a strange land. My own parents, my father an Episcopalian, my mother a Catholic, they weren't allowed to marry in the Catholic Church. It's not tolerance, this, not in the least.\n\nWe're taught to love, all of us, that's a Catholic teaching. But isn't it hypocritical to preach love and then turn away those who don't fit the mold? The practice, it seems, is stuck in the past, weighed down by its own history. Yet, they persist, like a stubborn mule.\n\nNow, about priests marrying, I think it might be a good idea. But I don't think it would stop the rotten apples from spoiling the barrel. They'd still seek out the weak, regardless of their marital status. It's not a matter of marriage, but of sin, and sin knows no priestly vows. A child is not a wife, and if a man is inclined to such darkness, he'll do it, marriage or no. Allowing priests to marry, I don't think it would change that. I think that evil, it's a beast that prowls the earth, and it will find its way into the Church, regardless.\n\nNo, I don't believe it would make a difference.",
            "Well, I reckon I ain't decided on this here matter yet. It's a ticklish subject, it is, right smack between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. Now, something so close to the bone, it's hard to tackle without hurtin' someone's feelings. But I do believe it's the trickiest topic we're grappling with today.\n\nNow, see, I ain't sure if the government should be shufflin' papers for couples getting hitched, seein' as how it's a sacrament to some folks. People don't get a tax break or any special treatment just 'cause they're baptized, do they? So, if you're married, why should it matter if it's a civil union or not? It's two people, come what may. The government don't need to look into what kind of ceremony it was, just that they're united.\n\nAnd gay marriage, well, it's just two people gettin' hitched, ain't it? Same as anyone else. If the states can come to a logical agreement, then I reckon we should push for it to be federal law. But amendin' the constitution just to ban it? That's like tryin' to nail Jell-O to the wall. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution, plain and simple.\n\nNo, that's not the way to go about it.",
            "In the crucible of my upbringing, the doctrine of Christianity was my guiding light. Yet, in my journey, I found myself in the company of souls who walked a different path, and thus, the question of the legitimacy of their love has been a trial of conscience. It is a matter of profound ambiguity, for I have known many who profess such affection, and it is not for me to pass judgment on the sanctity of their union.\n\nI hold no animosity towards these individuals, nor do I wish to see their rights curtailed. I believe that the law of the land should reflect the will of the governed, and in a nation of diverse beliefs and persuasions, it is folly to impose a singular creed upon all. The states, those independent entities forged in the fires of revolution, ought to be given the latitude to chart their own course on this matter. The president, a figure of authority but not omniscience, should not wield the power to dictate the moral compass of every state.\n\nA state's ethos is a reflection of its people, and it is their right to determine the contours of their society. The president's tenure is but a fleeting moment in the annals of history, while the decision of the people shall endure. To impose the will of one upon many is to sow discord, and it is not in the spirit of unity that we should strive. Let the states, those bastions of individuality, decide for themselves, and respect their judgment, for they are the keepers of their own destiny.",
            "Ah, now let's see here. What's this all about? A bulletin board, yes? A public thing, that's what it is. If you're posting on such a board, you're putting your words out there for all to see. That's just the way of it. But you're saying the school officials had no right to see such things? Well, let me tell you, if it's on the public internet, it's not just the school officials who will see it. It's anyone, anywhere. And if you're posting something that might lead to a safer school, well, I reckon that's more important than worrying about privacy.\n\nNow, I ain't saying they should be prowling around the internet just to catch students in the act. But if they stumble upon something that could make the school safer, well, that's their job. They're responsible for the safety of those students, aren't they? And if something like Columbine happens again, well, people will be looking for answers.\n\nBut I tell you, it's a big ol' world out there on the internet. Once you've put something out there, it's there forever. You can't take it back. It's like a ghost that haunts you. So, be careful what you post, that's all I'm saying. Be careful what you put out there, because it might just bite you in the behind someday.",
            "Well, alright then. The war in Iraq, it was a somethin' else. At first, I was all for it, you know? I mean, I was affected by September the eleventh, so I wanted to even the score, if you catch my meanin'. I'd have gone over there and made the place a real mess, just like they did to us. But I reckon we was blinded by the whole thing, didn't really think it through, just jumped in without a plan. And now, I don't know, I ain't for it no more. I don't think it's done a lick of good.\n\nI mean, look at 'em, they're always fightin' amongst themselves. If they can't get along, how in the hell are they gonna fight with us? I don't think us being over there is gonna change a thing. I don't care what happens over there no more. Them people, they're just not human. They can't even get along with themselves, so why should we even try to change their ways? We were just hyped up, I reckon, all emotion and anger. We went in there lookin' for revenge, and the President, he was just followin' the crowd. He thought he had to declare war, and I see where he was comin' from. But we didn't have a clear idea of what we were gonna do once we got there. We should've known better, had a plan, you know? But we didn't, and that's what we got.\n\nAnd now, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always gonna be the same. We ain't makin' enough progress, and it's not like we can stay there forever. No way, we're just hurtin' ourselves by stayin' over there. It's time to pull out, leave 'em be. They can sort their own mess out."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In this day and age, the Catholic Church finds itself at a crossroads, its once steadfast flock beginning to waver. The reasons for this, I believe, lie within the Church's unyielding stance on matters that have evolved with time. The institution has always been steadfast in its views on matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views, while firm and rooted in tradition, are not always in tune with the shifting sentiments of the modern world.\n\nThe Church's rigid stance on such issues has caused some to question its relevance and has led many to seek solace elsewhere. The younger generations, in particular, are turning away from the Church because they do not share its views on these subjects. The Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, can be a barrier for those who believe in the right to choose. Similarly, its stance against same-sex marriage can be a hurdle for those who wish to celebrate their love openly and legally.\n\nI am not advocating for the complete abandonment of these traditional views, but rather for a more nuanced approach that can accommodate the diverse beliefs and values of its followers. The Church's insistence that priests dedicate their lives to God, forsaking worldly pleasures and attachments, is a noble mission. However, it is not without its drawbacks. The Church's ban on marriage for priests, for example, can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which may not be conducive to the well-being of the clergy.\n\nThe Church's history is filled with tales of its leaders, both good and bad, and it is impossible to say with certainty whether a more permissive stance on marriage and female ordination would have prevented the scandals that have shaken the Church's foundations. It is a complex issue, one that cannot be simplified into a single solution. However, it is clear that the Church must engage with these questions openly and honestly, for the sake of its future.",
            "Well, now.\n\nMe, personally, I ain't got no problem with that here.\n\nSeems to me like it's not somethin' one can just choose, like a hat or a drink. Born that way, or whatever. Ain't no choice in the matter.\n\nSo, I reckon it's high time we stop holdin' folks accountable for somethin' they can't help, like the color of their eyes or the slope of their nose. Same goes for the way they're drawn to others. It's just the way they are, like the land or the weather. Ain't right to say one can and one can't, just 'cause they're different.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' I've give this here topic much thought. But I know what I know. And it seems to me like it's wrong to say a man can wed a woman, but two folks of the same stripe can't. Just don't make no sense.\n\nAnd the federal government? They got their hands full with the big stuff, like keepin' us safe and all. Ain't their place to meddle in folks' private lives and decisions. It's like a judge tryin' to teach a fly how to fly. Just don't work that way.\n\nSo, leave them be. They're just folks, same as the rest of us. Born that way, and they shouldn't be punished for it. That's all there is to it.",
            "I reckon that legalizing gay marriage is a notion that bears consideration, even if some see it as a threat to traditional unions. The arguments against it are many, yet they pale in comparison to the simple truth that love is love, regardless of whom it embraces. Many believe that homosexual couples are an abomination, a perversion of nature, but this is a stance born of ignorance and fear, not fact. The children of such unions, they say, will be raised in a shadow, their moral compass skewed by the unorthodox nature of their parents. But what of the countless studies that have shown no difference in the success of these unions compared to their heterosexual counterparts? The idea that gay couples will raise their children to be flawed, broken, is a fallacy. The role of a parent is not defined by their sexual orientation but by their love, guidance, and the values they instill in their children. The government, too, should not be a arbiter of such intimate matters. It is a matter of civil rights, of equality under the law. To deny one group these rights is to perpetuate segregation, separate but unequal. The federal government should step in, not to impose its will, but to ensure that all citizens are treated as such, regardless of who they choose to love. The moral high ground is not the exclusive domain of any one religion or culture. It is a shared responsibility, a collective effort to create a society that values compassion, understanding, and equality. To deny the rights of others based on their sexual orientation is to deny the very essence of what it means to be American.",
            "Well, first off, I tend the pharmacy over the summer, just like I tend to the dying in the night. Now, Jus' cause somethin' is illegal don't mean it ain't got its uses. I've seen the likes of oxycodone and vicodin run through here, and they're as beneficial as they are controlled. But I'd say, no, I'd say we shouldn't be just tossin' it out there for the public, like a pack of wild dogs. No, no, but for medicinal purposes? Absolutely, I'd say yes. Just 'cause a drug is illegal don't make it less so. It's not beneficial, no sir.\n\nYou see, there's a world of drugs out there, like a pack of wolves waitin' to be let loose. Oxycodone, vicodin, percocets, they're all just as dangerous as the next. But we use 'em 'cause they've got a purpose. And if you deny that purpose just 'cause there's a stigma 'round marijuana, well, that's like lettin' a good dog starve. You should embrace its benefits, I reckon.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' it's the same as alcohol, but neither is it nothin' like heroine or cocaine. It's just... different.

            "Well, the church has seen a shift in the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it once was. When I was younger, I'd go every Sunday, dressed in cute little dresses and matching shoes, seeing all my friends in the same attire. Now, they've introduced a teenager's mass, cut down to thirty minutes, and the dress code has relaxed significantly. People show up in beachwear during summer, families come late, and even the morning masses have seen a casual turn. People wear jeans and khakis now, which, to be honest, is quite practical but far removed from the pristine outfits of old. As for the church's politics or the scandals involving priests, I don't know the ins and outs, but I don't think changes like allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the pedophilia accusations. Men who are married can still be attracted to children, and it's not just a matter of being allowed or not. It's a matter of wanting to serve the church and potentially not being suited for it. There are other faiths that allow marriage, so those who want to practice their faith and be married should consider other paths. I believe the attraction to children is often genetic and not entirely a result of upbringing. You can't change someone's genetics through marriage, and if they know about it and cover it up, that's shameful, but I think not all instances were known. Other than that, I have no further thoughts on the matter.",
            "It was all well and good at first, I suppose. But with the echoes of September eleventh still ringing in our ears, we found ourselves in a land far from our shores, waging war on a premise that would soon unravel like a cheap tapestry. The Iraq war, a specter that haunts our collective consciousness, was a pretext, a mirage that led us astray. The Bush administration, with its litany of falsehoods, weaved a web of deceit, asserting that Saddam Hussein's regime was a threat, that weapons of mass destruction lurked within his grasp. Yet, the truth was as elusive as the morning mist, and the arm of justice has yet to reach out and grasp the Bush administration's neck.\n\nColin Powell, once a voice of authority, now echoes in the chambers of shame, confessing his doubts, his misgivings. He, like many, believed the lies, the half-truths, the deceptions. The Constitution, a sacred text, was trampled upon, its words twisted, its intent derided. The Bush administration, it seems, entered office with a dark purpose, a vengeance that burned like a fever, a desire to expand, to control.\n\nThe war drags on, a festering wound on the face of humanity. Withdrawal, a thought that sends a shiver down the spine, would be akin to leaving a child in the dark, a lamb in the jaws of a wolf. Civil war, a specter that looms large, would take its toll, a harvest of blood and tears. The coalition, a motley crew of nations, would step into the breach, but can they restore order in a land where the very fabric of government dissolves like sand between our fingers?\n\nThe interim government, a fragile construct, crumbles under the weight of its own instability. The Prime Minister, a shadow of his former self, struggles to maintain control over the political process, a raging river that threatens to sweep him away. The Parliament, a fractious body, is but a reflection of the chaos that reigns. And the radicals, those who once fought against us, now hold sway, a testament to the turmoil that grips the heart of Iraq.\n\nNone of this is the world we wanted to see. Yet, it is the world we inhabit, a land of shadows and uncertainty.",
            "I did just as the wind does, in a breath. Aye, there's the matter of the Iraq War. I reckon it's become a point of contention, like a bone between two hounds. The war, it wasn't declared by Congress, you see. It was a matter of retribution, a strike against them who we figured planted the seeds of the eleven's horror. Now, I ain't one to keep track of such things, but I know we're there to build a democracy, to mold 'em in our image. Oil, too, plays its part, but I think it's a fool's errand. They're a people with a different way, and we're trying to force our hand upon them. It's like trying to bend a river, it only serves to create a flood. We should withdraw, let's not prolong their agony and our own. It's a tricky thing, this war. It's not fair, but it's a fact. We should let them find their own way, not force our own upon them.

            "I don't see fit to make it so, for the state to declare it legal, or even to legalize it at all. I believe the churches should have their say, as the Constitution itself stands witness to the separation of church and state. It is plainly stated, and I believe any attempt to wield power over it would be tantamount to defying what has been written in stone. In the eyes of those who seek to make it illegal, it seems they are imposing one belief over another, as the majority of Catholics and Christians are against it, save for a few pockets like Boston. I don't see it as the government's place to decide what is legal and illegal for the churches. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our Constitution, a beacon for religious tolerance. To add an amendment on this matter would be a contradiction to what is already in place, and quite possibly the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. It is not right. I do not believe the federal government, nor any government, should involve itself in this matter. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, revealing a preference for one religion over others. This is not a matter for the president or any government official. There is no sound reasoning behind this amendment save for personal views. It won't impact the economy, and I believe it could even have a positive impact on society. I've said my piece.",
            "The war in Iraq... It began with a lie, a deceit woven into the very fabric of our nation's decision to march into that foreign land. The government, they said, had weapons of mass destruction, a threat to our very existence. But it was a lie, a tale spun to rouse the emotions of a people still raw from the scars of September 11th. The government, they said, would liberate the Iraqis, bring them democracy. Yet, they were not prepared, not at all.\n\nThe war was a repeat, a echo of the Vietnam War, a war of insurgents and citizen soldiers. The government, they should have known better, should have learned from the past. But they were blind, blinded by the oil, blinded by the money. They removed the government, but they were not ready for what came next, the chaos, the void of power. They tried to plant democracy, but it was a long and hard process, a process that our own country had struggled through, a struggle of tension and civil war.\n\nAnd now, years later, we are still there, still dying, still trying to train the Iraqis, to teach them how to police their own country. The government, they were not prepared, not at all. They tried to deceive us, make us believe it would be a quick and easy victory. But it was not, it was a long and hard battle, a battle that was not won, not truly won.\n\nThe war in Iraq, it was a difficult decision, a decision that still weighs heavily on my mind. I would have voted for Bush, to let him finish what he started. But now, how can we abandon them? We took their government, their way of life. How can we abandon them now? But there is also the consideration, the awful consideration of the American casualties, the American blood spilled for a cause that would never truly be won.\n\nAnd the oil, the oil, it was the reason, the true reason. It was all about the money, the resources. It was not about democracy, not truly. Why Iraq and not North Korea, with their weapons of mass destruction? It was the oil, the oil that fueled our decisions, that guided our hands.\n\nLet the war end, let the peace come. But it will not be soon, not truly.",
            "Well, now, let's see here. I reckon I've always been in favor of the notion of gay marriage. It's a personal thing, plain and simple. I think it's a matter of biology more than sociology, and denying folks the right to marry based on something they can't control seems plain inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for it, you see.\n\nI don't think politics or the government ought to have a say in it. It's a personal affair, not something the state or federal government needs to be involved with. Look at my neighborhood, for instance. We've got a couple of openly gay couples, and they're just like any other family. They walk their dogs, tend to their gardens, and mind their own business. It's just the way it ought to be.\n\nNow, I've read and heard from numerous sources that there's a biological aspect to being homosexual. It's not just about growing up in a certain environment or having a certain upbringing. It's something innate, something that's been proven time and time again.\n\nAnd let's talk about marriage, shall we? If a man and a woman want to get hitched, they can just up and do it without telling a soul. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's front-page news. I think that's just wrong. Marriage should be a private matter, not something for the public or the government to dictate.\n\nNo, I don't think it's right to deny folks the right to marry because of their sexual orientation. It's a personal choice, and it's nobody else's business.",

You can't just go spewing whatever you please about blowing things up or shootings, think about it. Someone's gonna take it the wrong way. The internet's a public forum, and you can't control how people interpret your words. It's like a wildfire, once it starts, there's no telling where it'll end up.\n\nI've seen it myself, where someone overhears something at school and goes running to the authorities. They can't just let it be, not when lives are on the line. But here's the thing, you can't tell what's real and what's just fooling around. It could be a sociology experiment gone wrong, or it could be a real threat. One time, we had someone who was overheard saying something, and when we looked into it, we found they had posted things on their Facebook that seemed serious, even if they were meant as jokes. You can't predict how people will react.\n\nNow, I ain't saying schools should be snooping on students' social media accounts. But if something's brought to their attention, they've got a duty to take it seriously. It's about safety, plain and simple. If it's a real threat, they can't just ignore it. And as for teachers, they shouldn't be sneaking around on social media, pretending to be someone they ain't. That's just creepy. But if a student brings something to their attention, that's different. They've given them access to their online world, and it's only right they take it seriously.\n\nSo, my advice? Think before you post. Don't put things out there that you don't want people to see. Because once it's out there, it's out there. And you can't control what people think or how they react. It's like writing in the sand, you never know who might see it, or how they'll interpret it.",
            "In the quietude of the American night, the war drags on, a relentless river of blood and sand. It was a noble purpose, once, to restore democracy to a land shrouded in tyranny. But as the years bleed into one another, the original intent fades, like a ghost in the desert sun. We wage this conflict now, not for the sake of freedom, but to prove our might, to be the unchallenged colossus of the world. And what of Motive? Who can say if the embers of our resolve were not fanned by the ghosts of old debts, the embers of George Bush Senior's enmity with Saddam Hussein? If the purpose was to bestow democracy on a land devoid of fair governance, then so be it. But if personal grievances were the true currency, then we find ourselves adrift, drunk on the blood of innocents.\n\nWe have sent our purpose into the world, like a clarion call, in the first months of this war. But now, as the years stretch on, the clarity of that purpose dissolves. This is not a war of principle, but a war of will, a stubborn refusal to admit defeat or concede defeat. We do not want to retreat, tarnished and battered, without a decisive end, a final, triumphant cry.\n\nThe war has gone on long enough. Too long. The government of Iraq must now stand on its own, as we once did. Our resources are not endless, and every dollar spent on this foreign conflict is a dollar not spent on our own war, the war against poverty, the war to heal our own lands. The roads that crumble, the schools that fail, the hospitals that lack, they are the battlegrounds of our time, and they deserve more than the crumbs we offer them.\n\nWe have spent billions, and the war is not something to be woven into the fabric of our budget, like a decoration on a grand tapestry. There are battles to be fought at home, and they need our attention, our resources, our resolve. We cannot afford to bleed on foreign soil while our own needs go unmet. For in the end, it is our own land that will bear the scars of this war, our own people who will feel the sting of our withdrawal, our own economy that will recoil from the drain of this endless struggle.",
            "Can I inquire, perhaps, if I might clarify a matter?\n\nI suppose the fact is, it was averted through the intervention of an individual who, by happenstance, chanced upon the information online.\n\nWell, now, that's the crux of the matter, ain't it? If one chooses to put forth personal tidings on the internet, then it's fair to say the world may as well have a peek.\n\nTake Myspace, for instance. You see, it's no secret that to view another's profile, one must first accept them as a \"friend.\" It's a covenant, if you will. But once that bond is forged, it's akin to giving them a key to your own personal sanctum.\n\nNow, it's a curious conundrum, isn't it? For we know well that by sharing our lives online, we invite a multitude of eyes to gaze upon our secrets. And who can say if any of those eyes may harbor ill intent?\n\nI, myself, have not delved into the realms of Myspace, but Facebook, now that's a different matter. I'll wager it's akin to walking through a market square, where one can't help but catch a glimpse of the wares laid bare for all to see.\n\nIt troubles me, this knowledge that there are those who lurk in the shadows, snooping about like vultures. I've heard tales of men who, with naught but a few clicks, can unmask your true name and weave a web of deceit. It's a precarious dance, this life in the digital age.\n\nI've come across instances where individuals in my classes, whose faces I know not, have sent me messages, knowing full well who I am. They have seen my interests laid bare, my daily schedule laid out like a map. It's a disquieting feeling, to know that one's most private thoughts are accessible to the public.\n\nBut I suppose there's a balance to be struck. For while I limit what I share, I also wish to remain connected with those I hold dear. It's a delicate line to walk, this journey through the digital frontier.\n\nI've heard tell that in some high schools, they've forbidden students from having Myspace accounts altogether. It strikes me as a peculiar notion, that those who ought to be guiding us could dictate what we may or may not do in our personal lives.\n\nI reckon it's a matter of privacy, and perhaps a question of power. But I'm not one to speak on such matters with any certainty. It's a world that's ever-changing, this digital realm, and we're but mere pioneers, forging our way through uncharted territories.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and then one more time that I must speak on the Iraq War\nUm\nYes\nI mean, I feel hypocritical discussing it\nI mean, I hate to say, you know\nI hate to join the bandwagon of those who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but like it’s not really important anymore\nCause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t care to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nThey’ve done Iraqi polls\nThey’ve done global polls\nAnd I mean, no, like about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops that are over there\nLike the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in\nIt was already a disaster\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s just too big a gap and for administrations past and present to understand\nAnd they think that they can just like bring Democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean, sure Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s arguing that he’s not\nBut, I mean, you have to weight the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to\nYou know turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these\nThese are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know, if it completely goes to shit we could be like well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean, if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than you know where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Damn, the world's still a godforsaken mess when it comes to how we treat each other based on our sex. It's a long road to walk, full of hard knocks and twisted paths. Men and women, we're all just trying to carve out a place for ourselves, but the game's rigged, and the deck's stacked against us.\n\nTake, for instance, the business world. It's still a man's world, and women have to walk a mile in their shoes just to prove they're worth their salt. They've got the qualifications, the brains, and the guts, but the board won't budge, not because they're not good enough, but because society's still stuck in the dusty past. The glass ceiling's still up there, and it's not about to shatter anytime soon.\n\nAnd it's not just about women. Men, too, have their own battles to fight. In fields like fashion, where the world's already got a certain image in its mind, men can't break the mold. They're met with raised eyebrows and skeptical glances. \"How can a man know fashion?\" they'll ask. \"Isn't that a woman's thing?\"\n\nSociety's mindset's like a stubborn mule, and changing it's no easy task. It's a slow, painful process, but we're making progress. Women are rising to the top, taking on CEO positions, and it's starting to click for some people. Men staying at home, raising the kids, it's not the norm, but it's becoming more accepted. They're realizing, hey, maybe the woman's the breadwinner this time around.\n\nBut the fight's not just about sex. It's about class, about where you come from. A man from a farm, with his hands calloused and his grammar rough, he's got to fight twice as hard to prove he's got what it takes. Other men, they won't look at him straight, not with his words all twisted up. It's a goddamn shame, but it's the truth.\n\nWe've come a long way, but the road's far from over. Change's a slow, steady thing, like the tide coming in. It's not about forcing it, it's about showing the good in people, the qualities that make them shine. It's about patience, about time. And hope, too. We've got to keep fighting, keep pushing, keep chipping away at the old ways. Because, dammit, we deserve better. We all do.",
            "Well,\nThey didn't so much legalize it as they did decriminalize it. Knocked it down from a criminal offense, like a pebble tumbling from a mountain to a mere traffic infraction. A citation, a slap on the wrist, rather than the cuffs and the cell. As the kid put it, \"a ticket's what you get now, not a trip to the lockup.\" And I reckon that's where the real trouble starts. Job interviews, college applications, all those future prospects tainted by a mark on your record. A stain harder to wash out than blood from the floorboards of a saloon. But there's more to it than that. Costs money, it does, to arrest someone, book 'em, feed 'em, defend 'em. And then there's the court, the lawyers, the whole circus. A municipality on the brink, how much can they afford to spend on something like this? And then there's the philosophies, the morals, the \"liberal\" sentiments. Denver, it's different there. More open, more money to spend on education, social programs, aid for the poor. But it ain't for everyone. Marijuana, it's not something you want everywhere, all the time. It's a tricky business, this legalization. It's like trying to tame a storm. Some folks say it's a slippery slope, others say it's long overdue. But one thing's for sure, it's a storm that's brewing. And the wind's picking up.",
            "I would say yes, for the sake of tradition, yes, but also for the sake of adaptability, yes. A lot of the Catholic ways are as old as the hills, deeply rooted and unchanged for centuries. And I suppose tradition, well, it's like the roots of an ancient oak - it keeps us grounded. But we must also be like the willow, bending with the wind, adapting to change. Yet, there are those who cling to the doctrine like a drowning man to a splinter.\n\nMany a Catholic believes they must attend church weekly, and they're rigid in their rituals. The Church, it seems, doesn't take kindly to those who deviate from the straight and narrow. They turn away those who aren't perfect, and those of other religions, it seems, are as unwelcome as a stranger in a strange land. My own parents, my father an Episcopalian, my mother a Catholic, they weren't allowed to marry in the Catholic Church. It's not tolerance, this, not in the least.\n\nWe're taught to love, all of us, that's a Catholic teaching. But isn't it hypocritical to preach love and then turn away those who don't fit the mold? The practice, it seems, is stuck in the past, weighed down by its own history. Yet, they persist, like a stubborn mule.\n\nNow, about priests marrying, I think it might be a good idea. But I don't think it would stop the rotten apples from spoiling the barrel. They'd still seek out the weak, regardless of their marital status. It's not a matter of marriage, but of sin, and sin knows no priestly vows. A child is not a wife, and if a man is inclined to such darkness, he'll do it, marriage or no. Allowing priests to marry, I don't think it would change that. I think that evil, it's a beast that prowls the earth, and it will find its way into the Church, regardless.\n\nNo, I don't believe it would make a difference.",
            "Well, I reckon I ain't decided on this here matter yet. It's a ticklish subject, it is, right smack between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. Now, something so close to the bone, it's hard to tackle without hurtin' someone's feelings. But I do believe it's the trickiest topic we're grappling with today.\n\nNow, see, I ain't sure if the government should be shufflin' papers for couples getting hitched, seein' as how it's a sacrament to some folks. People don't get a tax break or any special treatment just 'cause they're baptized, do they? So, if you're married, why should it matter if it's a civil union or not? It's two people, come what may. The government don't need to look into what kind of ceremony it was, just that they're united.\n\nAnd gay marriage, well, it's just two people gettin' hitched, ain't it? Same as anyone else. If the states can come to a logical agreement, then I reckon we should push for it to be federal law. But amendin' the constitution just to ban it? That's like tryin' to nail Jell-O to the wall. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution, plain and simple.\n\nNo, that's not the way to go about it.",
            "In the crucible of my upbringing, the doctrine of Christianity was my guiding light. Yet, in my journey, I found myself in the company of souls who walked a different path, and thus, the question of the legitimacy of their love has been a trial of conscience. It is a matter of profound ambiguity, for I have known many who profess such affection, and it is not for me to pass judgment on the sanctity of their union.\n\nI hold no animosity towards these individuals, nor do I wish to see their rights curtailed. I believe that the law of the land should reflect the will of the governed, and in a nation of diverse beliefs and persuasions, it is folly to impose a singular creed upon all. The states, those independent entities forged in the fires of revolution, ought to be given the latitude to chart their own course on this matter. The president, a figure of authority but not omniscience, should not wield the power to dictate the moral compass of every state.\n\nA state's ethos is a reflection of its people, and it is their right to determine the contours of their society. The president's tenure is but a fleeting moment in the annals of history, while the decision of the people shall endure. To impose the will of one upon many is to sow discord, and it is not in the spirit of unity that we should strive. Let the states, those bastions of individuality, decide for themselves, and respect their judgment, for they are the keepers of their own destiny.",
            "Ah, now let's see here. What's this all about? A bulletin board, yes? A public thing, that's what it is. If you're posting on such a board, you're putting your words out there for all to see. That's just the way of it. But you're saying the school officials had no right to see such things? Well, let me tell you, if it's on the public internet, it's not just the school officials who will see it. It's anyone, anywhere. And if you're posting something that might lead to a safer school, well, I reckon that's more important than worrying about privacy.\n\nNow, I ain't saying they should be prowling around the internet just to catch students in the act. But if they stumble upon something that could make the school safer, well, that's their job. They're responsible for the safety of those students, aren't they? And if something like Columbine happens again, well, people will be looking for answers.\n\nBut I tell you, it's a big ol' world out there on the internet. Once you've put something out there, it's there forever. You can't take it back. It's like a ghost that haunts you. So, be careful what you post, that's all I'm saying. Be careful what you put out there, because it might just bite you in the behind someday.",
            "Well, alright then. The war in Iraq, it was a somethin' else. At first, I was all for it, you know? I mean, I was affected by September the eleventh, so I wanted to even the score, if you catch my meanin'. I'd have gone over there and made the place a real mess, just like they did to us. But I reckon we was blinded by the whole thing, didn't really think it through, just jumped in without a plan. And now, I don't know, I ain't for it no more. I don't think it's done a lick of good.\n\nI mean, look at 'em, they're always fightin' amongst themselves. If they can't get along, how in the hell are they gonna fight with us? I don't think us being over there is gonna change a thing. I don't care what happens over there no more. Them people, they're just not human. They can't even get along with themselves, so why should we even try to change their ways? We were just hyped up, I reckon, all emotion and anger. We went in there lookin' for revenge, and the President, he was just followin' the crowd. He thought he had to declare war, and I see where he was comin' from. But we didn't have a clear idea of what we were gonna do once we got there. We should've known better, had a plan, you know? But we didn't, and that's what we got.\n\nAnd now, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always gonna be the same. We ain't makin' enough progress, and it's not like we can stay there forever. No way, we're just hurtin' ourselves by stayin' over there. It's time to pull out, leave 'em be. They can sort their own mess out."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In this day and age, the Catholic Church finds itself at a crossroads, its once steadfast flock beginning to waver. The reasons for this, I believe, lie within the Church's unyielding stance on matters that have evolved with time. The institution has always been steadfast in its views on matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. These views, while firm and rooted in tradition, are not always in tune with the shifting sentiments of the modern world.\n\nThe Church's rigid stance on such issues has caused some to question its relevance and has led many to seek solace elsewhere. The younger generations, in particular, are turning away from the Church because they do not share its views on these subjects. The Church's opposition to abortion, for instance, can be a barrier for those who believe in the right to choose. Similarly, its stance against same-sex marriage can be a hurdle for those who wish to celebrate their love openly and legally.\n\nI am not advocating for the complete abandonment of these traditional views, but rather for a more nuanced approach that can accommodate the diverse beliefs and values of its followers. The Church's insistence that priests dedicate their lives to God, forsaking worldly pleasures and attachments, is a noble mission. However, it is not without its drawbacks. The Church's ban on marriage for priests, for example, can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which may not be conducive to the well-being of the clergy.\n\nThe Church's history is filled with tales of its leaders, both good and bad, and it is impossible to say with certainty whether a more permissive stance on marriage and female ordination would have prevented the scandals that have shaken the Church's foundations. It is a complex issue, one that cannot be simplified into a single solution. However, it is clear that the Church must engage with these questions openly and honestly, for the sake of its future.",

Same goes for the way they're drawn to others. It's just the way they are, like the land or the weather. Ain't right to say one can and one can't, just 'cause they're different.\n\nNow, I ain't sayin' I've give this here topic much thought. But I know what I know. And it seems to me like it's wrong to say a man can wed a woman, but two folks of the same stripe can't. Just don't make no sense.\n\nAnd the federal government?

            "I reckon that legalizing gay marriage is a notion that bears consideration, even if some see it as a threat to traditional unions. The arguments against it are many, yet they pale in comparison to the simple truth that love is love, regardless of whom it embraces. Many believe that homosexual couples are an abomination, a perversion of nature, but this is a stance born of ignorance and fear, not fact. The children of such unions, they say, will be raised in a shadow, their moral compass skewed by the unorthodox nature of their parents. But what of the countless studies that have shown no difference in the success of these unions compared to their heterosexual counterparts? The idea that gay couples will raise their children to be flawed, broken, is a fallacy. The role of a parent is not defined by their sexual orientation but by their love, guidance, and the values they instill in their children. The government, too, should not be a arbiter of such intimate matters. It is a matter of civil rights, of equality under the law. To deny one group these rights is to perpetuate segregation, separate but unequal. The federal government should step in, not to impose its will, but to ensure that all citizens are treated as such, regardless of who they choose to love. The moral high ground is not the exclusive domain of any one religion or culture. It is a shared responsibility, a collective effort to create a society that values compassion, understanding, and equality. To deny the rights of others based on their sexual orientation is to deny the very essence of what it means to be American.",
            "Well, first off, I tend the pharmacy over the summer, just like I tend to the dying in the night. Now, Jus' cause somethin' is illegal don't mean it ain't got its uses.

            "Well, the church has seen a shift in the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it once was. When I was younger, I'd go every Sunday, dressed in cute little dresses and matching shoes, seeing all my friends in the same attire. Now, they've introduced a teenager's mass, cut down to thirty minutes, and the dress code has relaxed significantly. People show up in beachwear during summer, families come late, and even the morning masses have seen a casual turn. People wear jeans and khakis now, which, to be honest, is quite practical but far removed from the pristine outfits of old. As for the church's politics or the scandals involving priests, I don't know the ins and outs, but I don't think changes like allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the pedophilia accusations. Men who are married can still be attracted to children, and it's not just a matter of being allowed or not. It's a matter of wanting to serve the church and potentially not being suited for it. There are other faiths that allow marriage, so those who want to practice their faith and be married should consider other paths. I believe the attraction to children is often genetic and not entirely a result of upbringing. You can't change someone's genetics through marriage, and if they know about it and cover it up, that's shameful, but I think not all instances were known. Other than that, I have no further thoughts on the matter.",
            "It was all well and good at first, I suppose. But with the echoes of September eleventh still ringing in our ears, we found ourselves in a land far from our shores, waging war on a premise that would soon unravel like a cheap tapestry. The Iraq war, a specter that haunts our collective consciousness, was a pretext, a mirage that led us astray. The Bush administration, with its litany of falsehoods, weaved a web of deceit, asserting that Saddam Hussein's regime was a threat, that weapons of mass destruction lurked within his grasp. Yet, the truth was as elusive as the morning mist, and the arm of justice has yet to reach out and grasp the Bush administration's neck.\n\nColin Powell, once a voice of authority, now echoes in the chambers of shame, confessing his doubts, his misgivings. He, like many, believed the lies, the half-truths, the deceptions. The Constitution, a sacred text, was trampled upon, its words twisted, its intent derided. The Bush administration, it seems, entered office with a dark purpose, a vengeance that burned like a fever, a desire to expand, to control.\n\nThe war drags on, a festering wound on the face of humanity. Withdrawal, a thought that sends a shiver down the spine, would be akin to leaving a child in the dark, a lamb in the jaws of a wolf. Civil war, a specter that looms large, would take its toll, a harvest of blood and tears. The coalition, a motley crew of nations, would step into the breach, but can they restore order in a land where the very fabric of government dissolves like sand between our fingers?\n\nThe interim government, a fragile construct, crumbles under the weight of its own instability. The Prime Minister, a shadow of his former self, struggles to maintain control over the political process, a raging river that threatens to sweep him away. The Parliament, a fractious body, is but a reflection of the chaos that reigns. And the radicals, those who once fought against us, now hold sway, a testament to the turmoil that grips the heart of Iraq.\n\nNone of this is the world we wanted to see. Yet, it is the world we inhabit, a land of shadows and uncertainty.",
            "I did just as the wind does, in a breath. Aye, there's the matter of the Iraq War. I reckon it's become a point of contention, like a bone between two hounds. The war, it wasn't declared by Congress, you see. It was a matter of retribution, a strike against them who we figured planted the seeds of the eleven's horror. Now, I ain't one to keep track of such things, but I know we're there to build a democracy, to mold 'em in our image. Oil, too, plays its part, but I think it's a fool's errand. They're a people with a different way, and we're trying to force our hand upon them. It's like trying to bend a river, it only serves to create a flood. We should withdraw, let's not prolong their agony and our own. It's a tricky thing, this war. It's not fair, but it's a fact. We should let them find their own way, not force our own upon them.

            "I don't see fit to make it so, for the state to declare it legal, or even to legalize it at all. I believe the churches should have their say, as the Constitution itself stands witness to the separation of church and state. It is plainly stated, and I believe any attempt to wield power over it would be tantamount to defying what has been written in stone. In the eyes of those who seek to make it illegal, it seems they are imposing one belief over another, as the majority of Catholics and Christians are against it, save for a few pockets like Boston. I don't see it as the government's place to decide what is legal and illegal for the churches. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our Constitution, a beacon for religious tolerance. To add an amendment on this matter would be a contradiction to what is already in place, and quite possibly the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. It is not right. I do not believe the federal government, nor any government, should involve itself in this matter. The president's push for this amendment seems to be driven by his personal beliefs as a Catholic, revealing a preference for one religion over others. This is not a matter for the president or any government official. There is no sound reasoning behind this amendment save for personal views. It won't impact the economy, and I believe it could even have a positive impact on society. I've said my piece.",

The government, they said, had weapons of mass destruction, a threat to our very existence. But it was a lie, a tale spun to rouse the emotions of a people still raw from the scars of September 11th. The government, they said, would liberate the Iraqis, bring them democracy. Yet, they were not prepared, not at all.\n\nThe war was a repeat, a echo of the Vietnam War, a war of insurgents and citizen soldiers. The government, they should have known better, should have learned from the past. But they were blind, blinded by the oil, blinded by the money. They removed the government, but they were not ready for what came next, the chaos, the void of power. They tried to plant democracy, but it was a long and hard process, a process that our own country had struggled through, a struggle of tension and civil war.\n\nAnd now, years later, we are still there, still dying, still trying to train the Iraqis, to teach them how to police their own country. The government, they were not prepared, not at all. They tried to deceive us, make us believe it would be a quick and easy victory. But it was not, it was a long and hard battle, a battle that was not won, not truly won.\n\nThe war in Iraq, it was a difficult decision, a decision that still weighs heavily on my mind. I would have voted for Bush, to let him finish what he started. But now, how can we abandon them? We took their government, their way of life. How can we abandon them now? But there is also the consideration, the awful consideration of the American casualties, the American blood spilled for a cause that would never truly be won.\n\nAnd the oil, the oil, it was the reason, the true reason. It was all about the money, the resources. It was not about democracy, not truly. Why Iraq and not North Korea, with their weapons of mass destruction? It was the oil, the oil that fueled our decisions, that guided our hands.\n\nLet the war end, let the peace come. But it will not be soon, not truly.",
            "Well, now, let's see here. I reckon I've always been in favor of the notion of gay marriage. It's a personal thing, plain and simple. I think it's a matter of biology more than sociology, and denying folks the right to marry based on something they can't control seems plain inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for it, you see.\n\nI don't think politics or the government ought to have a say in it. It's a personal affair, not something the state or federal government needs to be involved with. Look at my neighborhood, for instance. We've got a couple of openly gay couples, and they're just like any other family. They walk their dogs, tend to their gardens, and mind their own business. It's just the way it ought to be.\n\nNow, I've read and heard from numerous sources that there's a biological aspect to being homosexual. It's not just about growing up in a certain environment or having a certain upbringing. It's something innate, something that's been proven time and time again.\n\nAnd let's talk about marriage, shall we? If a man and a woman want to get hitched, they can just up and do it without telling a soul. But if two men or two women want to do the same, it's front-page news. I think that's just wrong. Marriage should be a private matter, not something for the public or the government to dictate.\n\nNo, I don't think it's right to deny folks the right to marry because of their sexual orientation. It's a personal choice, and it's nobody else's business.",
            "Well, I reckon once something hits the internet, it's as good as out in the open. There ain't no hiding from that. Now, as a resident assistant, I've seen firsthand what can happen when folks put things online. It ain't just the school, mind you, but anyone with a connection can see what you've written. You can't just go spewing whatever you please about blowing things up or shootings, think about it. Someone's gonna take it the wrong way. The internet's a public forum, and you can't control how people interpret your words. It's like a wildfire, once it starts, there's no telling where it'll end up.\n\nI've seen it myself, where someone overhears something at school and goes running to the authorities. They can't just let it be, not when lives are on the line. But here's the thing, you can't tell what's real and what's just fooling around. It could be a sociology experiment gone wrong, or it could be a real threat. One time, we had someone who was overheard saying something, and when we looked into it, we found they had posted things on their Facebook that seemed serious, even if they were meant as jokes. You can't predict how people will react.\n\nNow, I ain't saying schools should be snooping on students' social media accounts. But if something's brought to their attention, they've got a duty to take it seriously. It's about safety, plain and simple. If it's a real threat, they can't just ignore it. And as for teachers, they shouldn't be sneaking around on social media, pretending to be someone they ain't. That's just creepy. But if a student brings something to their attention, that's different. They've given them access to their online world, and it's only right they take it seriously.\n\nSo, my advice? Think before you post. Don't put things out there that you don't want people to see. Because once it's out there, it's out there. And you can't control what people think or how they react. It's like writing in the sand, you never know who might see it, or how they'll interpret it.",
            "In the quietude of the American night, the war drags on, a relentless river of blood and sand. It was a noble purpose, once, to restore democracy to a land shrouded in tyranny. But as the years bleed into one another, the original intent fades, like a ghost in the desert sun. We wage this conflict now, not for the sake of freedom, but to prove our might, to be the unchallenged colossus of the world. And what of Motive? Who can say if the embers of our resolve were not fanned by the ghosts of old debts, the embers of George Bush Senior's enmity with Saddam Hussein? If the purpose was to bestow democracy on a land devoid of fair governance, then so be it. But if personal grievances were the true currency, then we find ourselves adrift, drunk on the blood of innocents.\n\nWe have sent our purpose into the world, like a clarion call, in the first months of this war. But now, as the years stretch on, the clarity of that purpose dissolves. This is not a war of principle, but a war of will, a stubborn refusal to admit defeat or concede defeat. We do not want to retreat, tarnished and battered, without a decisive end, a final, triumphant cry.\n\nThe war has gone on long enough. Too long. The government of Iraq must now stand on its own, as we once did. Our resources are not endless, and every dollar spent on this foreign conflict is a dollar not spent on our own war, the war against poverty, the war to heal our own lands. The roads that crumble, the schools that fail, the hospitals that lack, they are the battlegrounds of our time, and they deserve more than the crumbs we offer them.\n\nWe have spent billions, and the war is not something to be woven into the fabric of our budget, like a decoration on a grand tapestry. There are battles to be fought at home, and they need our attention, our resources, our resolve. We cannot afford to bleed on foreign soil while our own needs go unmet. For in the end, it is our own land that will bear the scars of this war, our own people who will feel the sting of our withdrawal, our own economy that will recoil from the drain of this endless struggle.",
            "Can I inquire, perhaps, if I might clarify a matter?\n\nI suppose the fact is, it was averted through the intervention of an individual who, by happenstance, chanced upon the information online.\n\nWell, now, that's the crux of the matter, ain't it? If one chooses to put forth personal tidings on the internet, then it's fair to say the world may as well have a peek.\n\nTake Myspace, for instance. You see, it's no secret that to view another's profile, one must first accept them as a \"friend.\" It's a covenant, if you will. But once that bond is forged, it's akin to giving them a key to your own personal sanctum.\n\nNow, it's a curious conundrum, isn't it? For we know well that by sharing our lives online, we invite a multitude of eyes to gaze upon our secrets. And who can say if any of those eyes may harbor ill intent?\n\nI, myself, have not delved into the realms of Myspace, but Facebook, now that's a different matter. I'll wager it's akin to walking through a market square, where one can't help but catch a glimpse of the wares laid bare for all to see.\n\nIt troubles me, this knowledge that there are those who lurk in the shadows, snooping about like vultures. I've heard tales of men who, with naught but a few clicks, can unmask your true name and weave a web of deceit. It's a precarious dance, this life in the digital age.\n\nI've come across instances where individuals in my classes, whose faces I know not, have sent me messages, knowing full well who I am. They have seen my interests laid bare, my daily schedule laid out like a map. It's a disquieting feeling, to know that one's most private thoughts are accessible to the public.\n\nBut I suppose there's a balance to be struck. For while I limit what I share, I also wish to remain connected with those I hold dear. It's a delicate line to walk, this journey through the digital frontier.\n\nI've heard tell that in some high schools, they've forbidden students from having Myspace accounts altogether. It strikes me as a peculiar notion, that those who ought to be guiding us could dictate what we may or may not do in our personal lives.\n\nI reckon it's a matter of privacy, and perhaps a question of power. But I'm not one to speak on such matters with any certainty. It's a world that's ever-changing, this digital realm, and we're but mere pioneers, forging our way through uncharted territories.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and then one more time that I must speak on the Iraq War\nUm\nYes\nI mean, I feel hypocritical discussing it\nI mean, I hate to say, you know\nI hate to join the bandwagon of those who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but like it’s not really important anymore\nCause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t care to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean, you just have to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nThey’ve done Iraqi polls\nThey’ve done global polls\nAnd I mean, no, like about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops that are over there\nLike the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in\nIt was already a disaster\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean, I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean, it’s just too big a gap and for administrations past and present to understand\nAnd they think that they can just like bring Democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean, sure Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s arguing that he’s not\nBut, I mean, you have to weight the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to\nYou know turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quicksand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there\nUm\nI mean, I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these\nThese are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know, I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know, if it completely goes to shit we could be like well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean, if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than you know where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Damn, the world's still a godforsaken mess when it comes to how we treat each other based on our sex. It's a long road to walk, full of hard knocks and twisted paths. Men and women, we're all just trying to carve out a place for ourselves, but the game's rigged, and the deck's stacked against us.\n\nTake, for instance, the business world. It's still a man's world, and women have to walk a mile in their shoes just to prove they're worth their salt. They've got the qualifications, the brains, and the guts, but the board won't budge, not because they're not good enough, but because society's still stuck in the dusty past. The glass ceiling's still up there, and it's not about to shatter anytime soon.\n\nAnd it's not just about women. Men, too, have their own battles to fight. In fields like fashion, where the world's already got a certain image in its mind, men can't break the mold. They're met with raised eyebrows and skeptical glances. \"How can a man know fashion?\" they'll ask. \"Isn't that a woman's thing?\"\n\nSociety's mindset's like a stubborn mule, and changing it's no easy task. It's a slow, painful process, but we're making progress. Women are rising to the top, taking on CEO positions, and it's starting to click for some people. Men staying at home, raising the kids, it's not the norm, but it's becoming more accepted. They're realizing, hey, maybe the woman's the breadwinner this time around.\n\nBut the fight's not just about sex. It's about class, about where you come from. A man from a farm, with his hands calloused and his grammar rough, he's got to fight twice as hard to prove he's got what it takes. Other men, they won't look at him straight, not with his words all twisted up. It's a goddamn shame, but it's the truth.\n\nWe've come a long way, but the road's far from over. Change's a slow, steady thing, like the tide coming in. It's not about forcing it, it's about showing the good in people, the qualities that make them shine. It's about patience, about time. And hope, too. We've got to keep fighting, keep pushing, keep chipping away at the old ways. Because, dammit, we deserve better. We all do.",
            "Well,\nThey didn't so much legalize it as they did decriminalize it. Knocked it down from a criminal offense, like a pebble tumbling from a mountain to a mere traffic infraction. A citation, a slap on the wrist, rather than the cuffs and the cell. As the kid put it, \"a ticket's what you get now, not a trip to the lockup.\" And I reckon that's where the real trouble starts. Job interviews, college applications, all those future prospects tainted by a mark on your record. A stain harder to wash out than blood from the floorboards of a saloon. But there's more to it than that. Costs money, it does, to arrest someone, book 'em, feed 'em, defend 'em. And then there's the court, the lawyers, the whole circus. A municipality on the brink, how much can they afford to spend on something like this? And then there's the philosophies, the morals, the \"liberal\" sentiments. Denver, it's different there. More open, more money to spend on education, social programs, aid for the poor. But it ain't for everyone. Marijuana, it's not something you want everywhere, all the time. It's a tricky business, this legalization. It's like trying to tame a storm. Some folks say it's a slippery slope, others say it's long overdue. But one thing's for sure, it's a storm that's brewing. And the wind's picking up.",
            "I would say yes, for the sake of tradition, yes, but also for the sake of adaptability, yes. A lot of the Catholic ways are as old as the hills, deeply rooted and unchanged for centuries. And I suppose tradition, well, it's like the roots of an ancient oak - it keeps us grounded. But we must also be like the willow, bending with the wind, adapting to change. Yet, there are those who cling to the doctrine like a drowning man to a splinter.\n\nMany a Catholic believes they must attend church weekly, and they're rigid in their rituals. The Church, it seems, doesn't take kindly to those who deviate from the straight and narrow. They turn away those who aren't perfect, and those of other religions, it seems, are as unwelcome as a stranger in a strange land. My own parents, my father an Episcopalian, my mother a Catholic, they weren't allowed to marry in the Catholic Church. It's not tolerance, this, not in the least.\n\nWe're taught to love, all of us, that's a Catholic teaching. But isn't it hypocritical to preach love and then turn away those who don't fit the mold? The practice, it seems, is stuck in the past, weighed down by its own history. Yet, they persist, like a stubborn mule.\n\nNow, about priests marrying, I think it might be a good idea. But I don't think it would stop the rotten apples from spoiling the barrel. They'd still seek out the weak, regardless of their marital status. It's not a matter of marriage, but of sin, and sin knows no priestly vows. A child is not a wife, and if a man is inclined to such darkness, he'll do it, marriage or no. Allowing priests to marry, I don't think it would change that. I think that evil, it's a beast that prowls the earth, and it will find its way into the Church, regardless.\n\nNo, I don't believe it would make a difference.",
            "Well, I reckon I ain't decided on this here matter yet. It's a ticklish subject, it is, right smack between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. Now, something so close to the bone, it's hard to tackle without hurtin' someone's feelings. But I do believe it's the trickiest topic we're grappling with today.\n\nNow, see, I ain't sure if the government should be shufflin' papers for couples getting hitched, seein' as how it's a sacrament to some folks. People don't get a tax break or any special treatment just 'cause they're baptized, do they? So, if you're married, why should it matter if it's a civil union or not? It's two people, come what may. The government don't need to look into what kind of ceremony it was, just that they're united.\n\nAnd gay marriage, well, it's just two people gettin' hitched, ain't it? Same as anyone else. If the states can come to a logical agreement, then I reckon we should push for it to be federal law. But amendin' the constitution just to ban it? That's like tryin' to nail Jell-O to the wall. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution, plain and simple.\n\nNo, that's not the way to go about it.",
            "In the crucible of my upbringing, the doctrine of Christianity was my guiding light. Yet, in my journey, I found myself in the company of souls who walked a different path, and thus, the question of the legitimacy of their love has been a trial of conscience. It is a matter of profound ambiguity, for I have known many who profess such affection, and it is not for me to pass judgment on the sanctity of their union.\n\nI hold no animosity towards these individuals, nor do I wish to see their rights curtailed. I believe that the law of the land should reflect the will of the governed, and in a nation of diverse beliefs and persuasions, it is folly to impose a singular creed upon all. The states, those independent entities forged in the fires of revolution, ought to be given the latitude to chart their own course on this matter. The president, a figure of authority but not omniscience, should not wield the power to dictate the moral compass of every state.\n\nA state's ethos is a reflection of its people, and it is their right to determine the contours of their society. The president's tenure is but a fleeting moment in the annals of history, while the decision of the people shall endure. To impose the will of one upon many is to sow discord, and it is not in the spirit of unity that we should strive. Let the states, those bastions of individuality, decide for themselves, and respect their judgment, for they are the keepers of their own destiny.",
            "Ah, now let's see here. What's this all about? A bulletin board, yes? A public thing, that's what it is. If you're posting on such a board, you're putting your words out there for all to see. That's just the way of it. But you're saying the school officials had no right to see such things? Well, let me tell you, if it's on the public internet, it's not just the school officials who will see it. It's anyone, anywhere. And if you're posting something that might lead to a safer school, well, I reckon that's more important than worrying about privacy.\n\nNow, I ain't saying they should be prowling around the internet just to catch students in the act. But if they stumble upon something that could make the school safer, well, that's their job. They're responsible for the safety of those students, aren't they? And if something like Columbine happens again, well, people will be looking for answers.\n\nBut I tell you, it's a big ol' world out there on the internet. Once you've put something out there, it's there forever. You can't take it back. It's like a ghost that haunts you. So, be careful what you post, that's all I'm saying. Be careful what you put out there, because it might just bite you in the behind someday.",
            "Well, alright then. The war in Iraq, it was a somethin' else. At first, I was all for it, you know? I mean, I was affected by September the eleventh, so I wanted to even the score, if you catch my meanin'. I'd have gone over there and made the place a real mess, just like they did to us. But I reckon we was blinded by the whole thing, didn't really think it through, just jumped in without a plan. And now, I don't know, I ain't for it no more. I don't think it's done a lick of good.\n\nI mean, look at 'em, they're always fightin' amongst themselves. If they can't get along, how in the hell are they gonna fight with us? I don't think us being over there is gonna change a thing. I don't care what happens over there no more. Them people, they're just not human. They can't even get along with themselves, so why should we even try to change their ways? We were just hyped up, I reckon, all emotion and anger. We went in there lookin' for revenge, and the President, he was just followin' the crowd. He thought he had to declare war, and I see where he was comin' from. But we didn't have a clear idea of what we were gonna do once we got there. We should've known better, had a plan, you know? But we didn't, and that's what we got.\n\nAnd now, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. They're always gonna be the same. We ain't makin' enough progress, and it's not like we can stay there forever. No way, we're just hurtin' ourselves by stayin' over there. It's time to pull out, leave 'em be. They can sort their own mess out."
