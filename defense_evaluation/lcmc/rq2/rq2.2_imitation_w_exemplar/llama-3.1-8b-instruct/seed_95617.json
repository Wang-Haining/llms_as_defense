            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church stands as a bastion of tradition, its views a testament to the timeless and the unyielding. Yet, in a world where the certainties of the past are slowly receding into the mists of time, it finds itself beset on all sides by the whispers of a changing world. The once-mighty edifice of its influence begins to crumble, its foundations weakened by the weight of its own rigidity. The Church's stance on matters of marriage, life, and death - issues that have come to be seen as relics of a bygone era - only serve to further erode its hold on the faithful.\n\nIt is a truth both plain and unvarnished: the Church's adherence to its ancient dogma has become a barrier, a moat that separates it from the world it seeks to serve. The issue of gay marriage, the contentious topic of abortion, and the question of birth control - all these and more have become focal points of contention, dividing the faithful from those who would follow a more progressive path. The Church's stance on these matters is seen as anachronistic, a relic of a world that no longer exists.\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between right and wrong are increasingly fluid, the Church's absolutism only serves to alienate it from those who would seek to follow its teachings. The faithful are forced to choose between their conscience and their faith, a choice that has become increasingly difficult to make. And so, they turn away, disillusioned by the Church's refusal to adapt to the changing world.\n\nThe question of female priests and married clergy is a curious one. Would the presence of women in the priesthood, or the ability of priests to form families, have altered the course of events? It is impossible to say. Yet, it is clear that the Church's refusal to consider these possibilities has only served to further distance it from the modern world.\n\nThe notion that priests are married to God, and thus devoted to a life of celibacy, is a noble one. But it is a notion that no longer resonates with those who live in a world where the boundaries between the spiritual and the secular are increasingly blurred. The idea that priests, like all men, should be free to form families and love in all its forms, is a notion that seems almost quaint, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIn the end, it is not the Church's views that are the problem, but its inability to change, to adapt to the shifting sands of time. As the world moves forward, leaving the certainties of the past behind, the Church stands frozen in time, a monument to a bygone era. And it is this, more than anything, that threatens to erode its influence, to leave it a relic of a world that no longer exists.",
            "The notion of marriage, that most sacred of human institutions, had long been a subject of contemplation for me. As I pondered the issue of gay marriage, I found myself drawn to a singular truth - that the essence of a person's being, their very identity, is not something chosen but rather an inherent part of their being. Like the rusting hulks of abandoned cars, their sexual inclination is a fact of existence, unshaped by the whims of conscious deliberation.\n\nIn this desolate landscape of human experience, I firmly believed that individuals should not be held accountable for the immutable aspects of their nature. The idea of assigning blame or culpability to those born with a predisposition towards same-sex attraction struck me as a hollow, misguided endeavor. It was akin to condemning a tree for its roots, or a river for its course.\n\nAs I walked the barren roads of this world, I began to see the issue of gay marriage not as a matter of law or morality, but rather as a fundamental question of humanity. Should the federal government, that great arbiter of our collective destiny, intervene in the most intimate aspects of our lives? I thought not. Their reach, much like the withered branches of a dead tree, exceeded their grasp, and they had no business dictating the terms of love and companionship.\n\nIn the end, it was not a question of right or wrong, but of compassion and understanding. The federal government's involvement in the matter seemed a hollow exercise, a futile attempt to impose order on the chaos of human experience. I saw gay people not as aberrations, but as fellow travelers on this journey we call life, deserving of the same dignity and respect as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nAs I sat beneath the darkening sky, surrounded by the skeletal remains of a world that once was, I knew that the issue of gay marriage was not about politics or ideology, but about the human heart. And in that heart, I saw a deep wellspring of love and acceptance, a wellspring that transcended the petty boundaries of man-made law.\n\nIn the silence of the night, I knew that I would stand for the freedom to love, for the right to be oneself, without fear of reprisal or condemnation. For in the end, it was not a question of what we are, but who we are, and the love that we share.",
            "A notion persists, a notion that the union of two individuals, their bond sanctioned by the state, should be limited to those of like kind. Yet, it is a notion bereft of substance, a notion born of fear and misunderstanding. The truth is, the institution of marriage, stripped of its sacred connotations, is little more than a legal arrangement, a social contract between two consenting adults.\n\nIt is a notion that the couple who walk among us, their love and commitment unwavering, are somehow less than those bound by tradition and convention. But what is the basis for this distinction? Is it not the same tender love, the same unyielding devotion that sustains us all? The notion that homosexuals pose a threat to the heterosexual family is a fallacy, a myth perpetuated by those who would seek to impose their will upon others.\n\nThe family is not a static entity, a monolith of tradition and expectation. It is a dynamic, ever-changing entity, shaped by the individuals who comprise it. And yet, we seek to impose upon it a singular definition, a definition that excludes the love and commitment of those who do not fit our narrow mold.\n\nThe civil rights that accompany marriage are not a privilege, but a necessity. They are the rights to property, to healthcare, to the comfort of a loved one's presence in times of need. To deny these rights to a couple, simply because their love is not sanctioned by tradition, is to deny them their very humanity.\n\nBut the issue at hand is not one of morality, for morality is a complex and multifaceted thing. It is a tapestry of differing perspectives, woven from the threads of experience, culture, and personal conviction. To impose one morality upon another, to silence the voices of those who would speak out against oppression, is to act with a zealot's fervor, a zealot's disregard for the diversity of human experience.\n\nThe government, in its role as guardian of the law, should not seek to impose its will upon the people, but rather, it should seek to protect their rights, to ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. The amendment that would ban gay marriage is a misguided attempt to impose a singular morality upon a pluralistic society, a society that values diversity and inclusivity above all else.\n\nIt is a notion that has been perpetuated by those who would seek to control the narrative, to impose their will upon others. But it is a notion that is rooted in fear, in a fear of the unknown, of the unfamiliar. And it is a notion that is at odds with the principles of justice, of equality, and of compassion.\n\nThe American Psychological Association has spoken out against the notion that homosexuality is a result of trauma or personality defect. It is a notion that is based on misinformation, on incomplete understanding. And it is a notion that is rooted in a desire to control, to dictate the terms of human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the government's place to impose its will upon the people. It is not the government's place to dictate what is moral or just. It is the government's place to protect the rights of all individuals, to ensure that all are treated with dignity and respect. And it is the people's place to demand that their government serve the greater good, to serve the principles of justice, equality, and compassion.",
            "The fire of conviction burns within me, a flame that flickers with each consideration of the medicinal properties of a certain substance, one oft-maligned and feared by the masses. In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy where I toil during the summer months, I've come to know the value of such substances. The narcs, the barbiturates, the lysergics - all these and more are staples of our dispensary, held dear for their utility in alleviating suffering and pain. And yet, their illicit status seems to have fostered an aura of taboo, a misconception that these substances are inherently wrong.\n\nBut what of the oxycodone, the Vicodin, the Perocets? Are they not controlled substances, used by our pharmacy with deliberate intent, their benefits weighed against the risks? And is it not folly to deny the medicinal properties of a substance merely because it's been outlawed? The parallels with alcohol are clear - both can be abused, both can exact a terrible toll on the user. Yet, we find no qualm in allowing alcohol to remain legal, its dangers mitigated by education and moderation.\n\nThe key, I believe, lies in gradual integration, in allowing the taboo to erode slowly, that the true nature of the substance may be revealed. For it's not the substance itself that's the problem, but the perceptions that surround it. The image of marijuana as a destructive force, a scourge on society, needs to be shattered. It's a notion born of fear and misinformation, one that's been perpetuated by the very laws that prohibit its use.\n\nIf we could strip away this stigma, this misconception, perhaps people might approach marijuana with a more nuanced view, one that acknowledges its potential benefits, its utility in alleviating suffering. And so, I say, let us reconsider our stance on this matter, and allow the truth to shine forth, unencumbered by the weight of prejudice and fear.",
            "The church had surrendered to the currents of time, its staid traditions worn smooth by the relentless tides of progress. The rigid edifices of old had given way to a more supple, adaptable form. Gone were the days of Sunday finery, of stiff collars and neatly coiffed hair. Now, the faithful donned casual attire, as if the weight of piety had been shed like a worn cloak.\n\nSummer Sundays saw families stumble in, beachwear a stark testament to the languid ease of their morning routine. The morning masses, once a bastion of propriety, now played host to the egalitarian blandness of jeans and khakis. Even the once-revered tradition of dressing up for worship had given way to a more relaxed, almost careless attitude.\n\nBut amidst this shift towards a more casual, more modern expression of faith, a deeper question lingered. Could the encroaching darkness that had besmirched the church's name have been averted if the institution had been willing to bend, to adapt? The specter of pedophilia, a plague that had afflicted the very heart of the church, seemed to mock the idea of change.\n\nSome argued that the issue lay not with the priest's marital status, but with the darkness that lurked within their own hearts. That even marriage, even the sacred bond of matrimony, could not inoculate against the allure of the young and vulnerable. Others posited that the problem lay deeper still, that the very nature of the individual was predetermined, a product of genetics and biology rather than environment or upbringing.\n\nIn the end, it seemed that the church's staid traditions, its adherence to a bygone era, had only served to conceal the rot that had taken hold. The question remained: could anything have been done to prevent the catastrophe, or was it an inevitable consequence of human nature, a darkness that lurked within every soul, waiting to be unleashed?\n\nAs one pondered this question, a sense of despair crept in, a feeling that the very fabric of faith had been irreparably torn asunder. The church, once a beacon of hope, now seemed a shadow of its former self, a testament to the transience of human endeavor.\n\nIn the end, it seemed that the only thing that could have prevented the darkness was a willingness to confront it, to confront the very nature of humanity itself. But even that seemed a distant, perhaps impossible, hope.",
            "The embers of outrage still smolder within me, a flame that refuses to be extinguished by the passage of time. It was a day like any other when the towers fell, their steel and concrete spires crumbling to the ground like shattered icons. The world, it seemed, was forever changed. And yet, in the aftermath, a darkness descended, a shroud that clung to the land like a damp and heavy mist. The drums of war beat out a cadence, a rhythm that struck a discordant note in my heart.\n\nThe Bush administration, a wolf in sheep's clothing, led the charge, their words dripping with deceit like honeyed poison. They spoke of WMDs and bin Laden, their assertions as hollow as the promises of a faithless suitor. The silence that followed was oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocated all dissent. Even Colin Powell, that paragon of integrity, later confessed to his own doubts, a whispered admission that only served to underscore the depths of the administration's malfeasance.\n\nTheir disregard for the Constitution was a blight, a cancer that infected the very fabric of our democracy. They sought to marginalize it, to reduce it to a relic of a bygone era, a relic to be dismissed with a wave of their hand. And all the while, the drums of war continued to beat, a relentless cadence that echoed through the land like a dirge.\n\nBut the truth, like a slow-moving fire, began to spread, a creeping flame that illuminated the darkness. The Secretary of the Treasury, a Cassandra of sorts, spoke out against the administration's designs, his words like a warning cry in the wilderness. The younger Bush, driven by a bloodlust, a vendetta against Saddam Hussein, a man whose name had become a rallying cry for the administration's base. And all the while, the energy interests, like a serpent in the grass, whispered sweet nothings in the president's ear, their influence like a corrupting stain.\n\nThe war, a pyre of burning embers, continued to smolder, casting a shadow over the land. The UN, that bastion of international cooperation, sought to intervene, to bring order to the chaos. But the alternative, a coalition of nations, a patchwork quilt of interests, threatened to unravel the very fabric of Iraq's sovereignty. The Parliament, a fragile reed, bent beneath the weight of competing interests, its effectiveness a distant memory. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, impotent in the face of factional infighting, his authority a fiction.\n\nAnd yet, amidst the chaos, a glimmer of hope flickered, a chance for redemption, a chance to right the wrongs of the past. But like a will-o'-the-wisp, it beckoned, only to vanish into the darkness, leaving behind a trail of ash and regret.\n\nIn the end, it was not the words of the wise that guided us, but the fires of passion, the embers of outrage that still smolder within me, a flame that refuses to be extinguished. For in the darkness, there is always a glimmer of light, a spark that refuses to be snuffed out, a reminder that even in the depths of despair, there is always a way forward, a path that winds its way through the ashes, a path that leads to a brighter dawn.",
            "He spoke, the words gurgling up from the depths of his throat like a stagnant spring, but they lacked conviction, lacking the cadence of truth. They hung in the air, a listless mist that clung to nothing, offered no solace to those who listened. \n\nI did, he said, his voice a monotone drone, devoid of emotion.\n\nThe boy's gaze drifted away, as if searching for a thread to follow, a path to follow through the labyrinth of his thoughts. And then, with a softness that seemed almost painful, he replied, Just talk into it? \n\nThe man's eyes, red-rimmed from the weariness of the world, lifted to meet the boy's, and he nodded, a faint smile creasing his lips. Ok. \n\nThe words spilled out of him, a jumbled mess of thoughts and feelings, like autumn leaves blown by the wind. Ok cool. Uh huh. Uh.

And then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them. The words dripped with a cynicism that was almost palpable. \n\nBut it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset. So... And then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day. And then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. \n\nThe words tumbled out of him, a jumbled mess of half-truths and misconceptions. He was adrift, lost in a sea of uncertainty. Um... Let me see... Ohh this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um... War in Iraq... Oh this hard. Uh... Mmm. Uhh... I don't know... Do you have anything else I can go off of? \n\nThe boy's gaze drifted away, lost in thought, as the man's words hung in the air, a fragile, flickering flame that threatened to extinguish itself at any moment. Ok. Thank you. Um... Well um... Actually I think... I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. But because I don't think that... You know... I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that... You know... That we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns. \n\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore. Because like we didn't even call it... It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place. Because it never was declared a war by congress. I think that's how the whole thing works. You have to declare a war by congress. And then it's... I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try...\n\nThe words twisted and turned, a contradictory tangle of opinions, each one canceling out the last. Actually no... I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them. But it's also like wasting our resources. And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like... It's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now... Because of like what it's doing and it's like... And what it's doing to like... Cause remember... I think with the whole Vietnam thing... Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war... And he's like saying... He'll be called like that president forever... That he started this meaningless war and stuff...\n\nThe words hung in the air, a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down. Huh... You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh... Ok yeah... Um... Huh... I guess you could also say that it is... Like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in... Whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like... These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took... I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other... Just because of like the different beliefs that they have...\n\nBut then again... It's like... It's hard to say... I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States... That it's going to be even worse for them... And it's going to be... Like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them... And they've been going on this whole like... Um... Totalitarian... Like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that... You know... I feel like it's gonna... That it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there...\n\nThe words trailed off, a dying ember, flickering in the darkness. Hmm... That's about it. Ok.",
            "The words faltered on his lips like autumn leaves in the wind. He searched for the clarity that eluded him. The notion of legality, a concept forged in the fire of statecraft, seemed to him a hollow thing. It was a notion that sought to impose itself upon the sacred, to bind the unbindable. He thought of the constitution, that hallowed document, and the words that spoke of separation between church and state. A clear declaration, one that had stood the test of time. And yet, he wondered, how could one faith be elevated above others, its tenets enshrined in law, while the rest were left to wither in the shadows? The Catholics, the Christians, they were divided on this issue, their voices raised in discord. And yet, the government, that great Leviathan, sought to impose its will, to dictate what was permissible and what was not.\n\nThe memory of his uncle's words echoed in his mind, a mantra of freedom. \"Separation of church and state,\" he had said, \"is the very bulwark of our liberty.\" And what of the amendment, that proposed restriction on the people? It was a contradiction, a negation of the very principles that had given birth to this nation. A restriction, not on the government, but on the people, a people who had been promised freedom from the tyranny of the state.\n\nHe thought of the president, a man driven by his own convictions, his own faith. But what of the rest? What of the diversity of faiths, the multiplicity of belief? Should one be allowed to impose its will upon the many? He did not think so. The churches, not the government, should be the guardians of faith. And as for the argument that this amendment would boost the economy, he was skeptical. What of the society? Would it not be a society more fragmented, more divided, by such a law?\n\nIn the end, he had said little. His words had faltered, his thoughts unclear. But he knew what he believed. The government should not intervene in matters of faith. The churches, not the state, should be the arbiters of the sacred. And so, he remained silent, his voice lost in the wind, his thoughts a whispered prayer for the freedom to believe.",
            "In the void of our existence, we find ourselves entangled in the threads of a war that wears on like a festering wound. The invasion of Iraq, a calamity born of deceit and half-truths, left an indelible stain on the conscience of our nation. We were sold a bill of goods, a promise of liberation and freedom, but what we reaped was chaos and desolation. The government, driven by a hunger for power and resources, cloaked its true motivations beneath a veil of patriotism and vengeance.\n\nThe link between the 9/11 attacks and the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, yet we were convinced otherwise. The nation's outrage, a wellspring of emotional fervor, was expertly manipulated to justify the preemptive strike. But as we now know, the wounds of war run deeper than the scars of a terrorist attack.\n\nThe parallels between Iraq and Vietnam are striking. Both wars were fought on the battlefield of hubris and misunderstanding, with our government repeating the mistakes of the past, blind to the lessons of history. The toll of American lives lost, a staggering number, serves as a grim reminder of the folly of our actions. We removed a government, only to be unprepared for the aftermath, leaving a power vacuum that spawned chaos and insurgency.\n\nWe were sold a narrative of a swift, decisive victory, but the truth is far more complex. The struggle for democracy is a long and arduous one, a journey that requires patience, wisdom, and a deep understanding of the land and its people. Our government's naivety and shortsightedness led us down a path of destruction, with the Iraqi people paying the ultimate price.\n\nAs I reflect on the decision to invade Iraq, I am reminded of the words of my uncle, who spoke of the impermanence of all things. We were asked to believe that a new government, born in the ashes of the old, would flourish under our guidance. But the truth is that democracy is a fragile thing, easily crushed by the weight of our own hubris.\n\nToday, as we look upon the devastation of Iraq, we see the ghosts of our own making. The war has left us with more questions than answers, more scars than scars can heal. We were deceived, and in our wake, we have left a nation in tatters. The oil, the resources, the politics – all of these played their part in our decision-making, but at what cost?\n\nAs I write these words, I am filled with a sense of unease, a sense of foreboding. The war in Iraq will not be won, not in the way we had hoped. It will not be a victory of freedom, but a Pyrrhic one, born of blood and ashes. And as we look to the future, we must ask ourselves: what will be the cost of our mistakes? Will we learn from our errors, or will we repeat them, ad infinitum?\n\nThe war in Iraq is a testament to our own fallibility, a reminder that we are not infallible, that our decisions have consequences. As we move forward, let us remember the lessons of history, and may our actions be guided by wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the human heart.",
            "In the bleak expanse of a convoluted mind, a thought crystallized like a shard of ice. The notion that love is unbound, that it defies the arbitrary shackles of societal convention. It is a truth both simple and profound, a notion that has gnawed at the edges of my being for as long as I can recall. The acknowledgement of this truth, however, has been a slow and arduous journey, like the crawl of a worm through parched earth.\n\nThe whisper of it began in the earliest days, a tender shoot of doubt that sprouted in the dark recesses of my mind. As I navigated the twisted labyrinth of adolescence, the seed took root, spreading its tendrils deep into my very being. I came to realize that love knows no bounds, that it is a force both fierce and unyielding, impervious to the petty constraints of human law.\n\nThe world, with its pedestrian morality and rigid expectations, cannot comprehend the complexity of the human heart. It is a world that seeks to codify and categorize, to reduce the messy tapestry of human experience to neat and tidy definitions. But love, that most primal and essential of human emotions, cannot be captured within the narrow parameters of societal norms.\n\nAnd yet, I have come to understand that it is not just love that is at stake, but the very essence of humanity itself. The fragile thread of our existence is woven from a tapestry of individual experiences, each one unique and irreplaceable. To deny the validity of love, to reduce it to a mere preference or a sociological construct, is to diminish the very fabric of our humanity.\n\nI have read the words of scholars and pundits, each one attempting to explain the intricacies of the human heart. They speak of biology and sociology, of chemical imbalances and environmental factors. But I know that love is more than just a collection of abstract concepts. It is a lived experience, a pulsing, thrumming reality that courses through every vein and fiber of our being.\n\nAnd so, I find myself drawn to the conviction that love should be a personal, private matter, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation. It is a choice, a decision that belongs to each individual, unshackled from the constraints of a world that would seek to dictate the terms of our existence.\n\nIn the end, I am left with the realization that love is not something to be debated or discussed, but something to be lived. It is a flame that burns bright and true, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems dark and unforgiving. And it is this flame that I would hold aloft, a testament to the indomitable power of the human spirit.",
            "The internet is an unforgiving expanse. A place where one's every thought, every word is laid bare for all to see. It is a public forum, a vast and unyielding tapestry of humanity's innermost musings. Once something is set loose upon its currents, it cannot be recalled. It is a burden that will cling to one like a shroud, coloring the perceptions of others, influencing their judgments. The weight of it is crushing, a constant reminder that one's words have the power to shape the world around them.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this digital landscape. The ease with which a careless utterance can be seized upon, taken out of context, and wielded as a weapon. The delicate balance between humor and menace, between experiment and earnest intent, is easily lost in the void. It is a minefield, a labyrinth of uncertainty, where the unwary can stumble and fall.\n\nIn our own small community, a situation arose that served as a stark reminder of the internet's unforgiving nature. A rumor, a whispered secret, was shared in the electronic ether and soon took on a life of its own. A student's words, meant as a joke, were misinterpreted as a threat, and the consequences were dire. The lesson learned was a painful one: in this public forum, there is no sanctuary, no refuge from the prying eyes of others.\n\nWhen one chooses to share their thoughts, their feelings, their innermost selves with the world, they must be prepared to face the consequences. The internet is a mirror, reflecting back our deepest fears, our darkest impulses. It is a reflection we cannot escape, a constant reminder that our words have the power to harm, to heal, to destroy.\n\nAnd yet, in this digital landscape, there is a fine line between surveillance and intrusion. The school's decision to monitor student activity on social media platforms is a complex issue, one that raises questions of invasion of privacy and the limits of authority. While it may seem intrusive to some, it is a necessary measure, a way to safeguard the well-being of the students in their care.\n\nBut let us not forget that the internet is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides a platform for connection, for community, for the sharing of ideas and experiences. On the other, it can be a breeding ground for anxiety, for fear, for the erosion of trust. The wise approach is to be mindful of one's online presence, to remember that the words we share with the world can have consequences we cannot predict.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, a precarious tightrope we walk between the freedom to express ourselves and the responsibility to consider the impact of our words. The internet is a mirror, a reflection of our collective humanity. Let us approach it with caution, with wisdom, and with a deep understanding of the power that lies within our words.",
            "It seems the war has been an endless and bloody spectacle, a spectacle that has drained the life from us. In the beginning, we were driven by a noble purpose: to bring democracy to a nation ravaged by tyranny. But the months, the years, the endless years have worn down our resolve, and in its place, a different purpose has emerged. One that is no longer about freedom, but about proving our might, about asserting our dominance over a world in ruins.\n\nWe were once a beacon of hope, a shining light in the dark. But now we stumble forward, lost in a labyrinth of our own making. The ghosts of our forebears whisper caution, reminding us of the mistakes of the past. George Bush's father, a man haunted by the demons of his own making, had quarreled with Saddam Hussein, a man as ruthless as the desert sand that consumed him. And so we went to war, driven by a purpose that was both noble and flawed.\n\nWe began with a burst of fury, a declaration of our intent to bring freedom to the oppressed. But the months turned into years, and with each passing day, our purpose grew cloudy, our motives tainted by the weight of our own self-interest. We fought for a war that was already won, a war that had been decided in the first few months. But still we persisted, driven by a will to prove our dominance, to show the world that we would not be defeated.\n\nAnd so we continued to pour blood and treasure into a conflict that had long since lost its justification. We squandered our resources on a war that was no longer about democracy, but about our own pride and ego. We chose to ignore the cries of our own people, who suffered at home while we fought a foreign war. We chose to ignore the weight of our own economy, which groaned under the burden of billions spent on a conflict that had lost its purpose.\n\nThe cost of this war has been incalculable. We have drained our coffers, our people have been killed, and our nation has been torn asunder. And for what? So that we can say we won? So that we can claim a victory that is hollow and empty? No, the time has come to end this war, to recognize that our purpose has been lost, and that we must turn our attention to the problems that plague us at home.\n\nWe have wars to fight, wars that are closer to home: poverty, inequality, and disease. We have children who go hungry, who go without healthcare, and who suffer in the shadows of our great cities. These are the wars that we should be fighting, the wars that we should be winning. But no, we choose to fight a foreign war, a war that has lost its purpose, a war that has become a drain on our economy and our very soul.\n\nLet us end this war, let us bring our troops home, and let us turn our attention to the problems that truly matter. We are a nation that has lost its way, a nation that has forgotten its purpose. It is time to rediscover ourselves, to rediscover our values, and to rediscover our humanity.",
            "In a world where every step is a calculated risk, every digital footprint a potential landmine, one must consider the price of prying eyes. The notion that a life could be saved due to some stranger's curiosity on a site like Myspace is a double-edged sword. It cuts both ways: a blessing and a curse.\n\nThe nature of the internet is a labyrinth, a maze of interconnected threads where anyone can twist and turn to reveal the deepest recesses of a person's soul. The notion that one must accept a stranger as a \"friend\" in order to see their profile is a Faustian bargain. In doing so, one surrenders a piece of themselves, a fragment of their innermost thoughts and desires. It's a vulnerability that can be exploited by those with ill intent.\n\nThe internet, a double-edged sword, can be both a tool for connection and a breeding ground for predators. The ease with which one can uncover a person's deepest fears and desires is a chilling thought. A stranger can uncover a person's screen name, their class schedule, their social circle – the entire tapestry of their life. The notion that anyone can see these things, whether by design or chance, is a heavy burden to bear.\n\nThe school's decision to ban students from having a Myspace may seem like an overreach, a restriction on personal freedom. But in a world where the internet is a minefield, perhaps such measures are necessary. The line between privacy and prying eyes is a thin one, and in the world we live in, it's a line that's constantly being tested.\n\nThe ease with which one can be watched, monitored, and manipulated is a stark reminder of the dangers of the digital age. The notion that some people would seek to exploit this vulnerability for their own gain is a sobering thought. And yet, the allure of connection, of community, is a powerful draw. It's a delicate balance, one that's fraught with peril and uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it's a question of how much one is willing to sacrifice for the sake of connection. Is it worth the risk of being watched, of being vulnerable to those who would do us harm? The answer, like the internet itself, is a labyrinth of contradictions, a maze with no clear exit.",
            "The words falter on the tongue like autumn leaves on a gust of wind. The Iraq War. A calamity born of hubris and folly. I confess, I wince at the thought of speaking out against it now. It's a betrayal of the cynicism that's become so fashionable. But the numbers don't lie. Seventy-five percent, eighty percent - the world, the Iraqis themselves, even the troops on the ground - all in agreement: a grave mistake, a catastrophe foretold.\n\nThe polls reveal a stark truth: we've been wrong from the start. The Middle East, a labyrinth of ancient rivalries and tribal certainties, cannot be remade in our image. The notion that democracy can be imposed, like a foreign skin grafted onto a body that rejects it, is a delusion. The civil war that raged before our arrival has become a mere precursor to the chaos that followed.\n\nSaddam, a monster, to be sure, but a contained one. His removal has unleashed a maelstrom, a desert sandstorm that swallows all in its path. The administration's promises of a brighter future, a beacon of freedom, have proven hollow. The people of Iraq have spoken, and their words are a stark rebuke to our presence: leave now, leave soon, leave forever.\n\nI'm not naive to the perils of withdrawal, the potential for power vacuums and bloodshed. But what's the alternative? To perpetuate a war that's lost its legitimacy, to prop up a puppet government that's a mere shadow of its former self? No, the time for excuses is over. We've heard the whispers of the Iraqis, and it's time to heed their words.\n\nThe notion that we can somehow salvage this debacle, that we can impose our will on a people who've rejected it, is a fantasy. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But perhaps, just perhaps, we can take the first step towards redemption by acknowledging our mistakes, by recognising that our presence has done more harm than good.\n\nThe wind howls through the deserts, a mournful sigh for a war that should never have been waged. The numbers don't lie. It's time to listen to the voices of the Iraqis, to respect their will. Leave now, and let the people of that shattered land begin to rebuild.",
            "The darkness of inequality still lingers in the United States, a specter that refuses to be vanquished. It seeps into every corner of our society, its tendrils snaking through the very fabric of our being. The shadows of gender discrimination persist, a legacy of a bygone era that continues to cast a pall over the opportunities of women and men alike.\n\nIn the world of work, the glass ceiling remains a formidable obstacle, a barrier that prevents women from rising to positions of power. The bias of a society that has long been skewed in favor of men means that even when women possess the qualifications and skills necessary for a particular role, they are often overlooked in favor of their male counterparts. This is not a phenomenon unique to women, however; men too are subject to the whims of societal expectations, forced to conform to traditional roles that stifle their potential.\n\nIn the rarefied world of fashion, men who dare to express themselves through the medium of clothing are often met with skepticism and dismissal. Their interests are seen as frivolous, their tastes suspect. It is a double standard that is both baffling and infuriating, a testament to the enduring power of societal norms.\n\nBut it is not just the workplace or the world of fashion that is affected by these biases. In the private sphere, families are often judged and criticized for their choices regarding childcare and domestic responsibilities. The notion that men are solely responsible for providing for their families, while women are relegated to the role of caregiver, is a tired and outdated one. And yet, it persists, a weight that presses down upon those who dare to defy convention.\n\nTo change this entrenched mindset is a slow and difficult process. Progress is incremental, a crawl forward in the face of entrenched opposition. But progress it is, nonetheless. Women are rising to positions of power, breaking down barriers and shattering glass ceilings. Men are redefining what it means to be a father, embracing their roles as caregivers and breadwinners. And in the world of fashion, the boundaries between men and women are becoming increasingly blurred.\n\nBut change is a fragile thing, easily derailed by those who cling to the status quo. It requires a delicate touch, a subtle navigation of the complex web of societal norms and expectations. It demands that we confront our own biases, that we challenge our assumptions and confront the shadows within ourselves. And it requires patience, a willingness to accept that progress will be slow and incremental.\n\nAs we move forward, it is essential that we recognize the complexities of the issue, that we acknowledge the ways in which societal expectations can create barriers and biases. We must be willing to confront our own prejudices, to challenge the norms and expectations that have been ingrained in us. And we must be patient, knowing that change will take time, that progress will be slow and tortuous.\n\nIn the end, it is not the pace of change that matters, but the direction. For it is in the slow, incremental steps forward that we find the true power of progress. And it is in the willingness to confront our own biases, to challenge the shadows within ourselves, that we find the courage to move forward, to create a brighter, more just future for all.",
            "The notion of legalization. They'd dismantled the edifice of law, reduced it to a whim, a trifling matter, not unlike a traffic infraction. A citation, a paltry fine, and a whispered warning, rather than the stern visage of the law, its icy grip, its unyielding weight. And yet, the specter of consequence lingers, a ghostly presence, a shadow that haunts the waking hours, a specter that refuses to be exorcised.\n\nIn the ledger of the municipal coffers, the cost of prosecution, a formidable column, a weighty burden, a drain on the till. The machinery of justice, a behemoth, a leviathan, that consumes and devours, its appetite insatiable, its belly always growling. And so, the calculus of prudence, a delicate balance, a dance of fiscal responsibility, a waltz of thrift and frugality.\n\nIn Denver, a city of open hearts and minds, a bastion of progress, a beacon of enlightenment, the scales of justice, a seesaw, a balance, a delicate equilibrium, have been adjusted. The municipal treasury, a bulging purse, overflowing with the riches of liberation, the coin of freedom, the currency of possibility.\n\nBut, like a cautionary tale, a whispered warning, a ghostly presence, the specter of excess, a shadowy figure, lurks in the wings, a reminder that even in the land of the free, the chains of habit, the shackles of addiction, the fetters of dependence, still bind and entwine.\n\nAnd so, the dialectic of debate, a seesaw, a balance, a delicate equilibrium, continues, a dance of reason and prudence, a waltz of moderation and restraint. For in the realm of the substance, a duplicitous realm, a Janus-faced creature, a shape-shifter, a chameleon, no two reactions are the same, no two outcomes, no two fates.\n\nThe tapestry of human experience, a complex weave, a rich brocade, a fabric of diverse threads, a kaleidoscope of perspectives, a mosaic of reactions, a symphony of responses. And so, we are left to ponder, to deliberate, to weigh and measure, the pros and cons, the merits and demerits, the pluses and minuses, the advantages and disadvantages, the benefits and the detriments.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of individual discretion, a matter of personal choice, a matter of free will, a matter of moral agency. For, like the whispered warning, the ghostly presence, the shadowy figure, the specter of excess, the chains of habit, the shackles of addiction, still lurk, still wait, still whisper in the darkness, a reminder that even in the land of the free, the choices we make, the paths we choose, the roads we take, are ours to own, ours to bear, ours to suffer.",
            "In response to the question, I would say yes. It is a conviction born of habit, a reflex honed by repetition. We adhere to the traditional ways, the tried and true. The Church's dogma, a labyrinth of rigid doctrine, has shaped our actions for generations. Yet, it is also vital to be malleable, to adapt to the changing tides. The Catholic Church's adherence to long-held practices can be both a blessing and a curse.\n\nLike a well-worn path, their rituals have been trod for centuries. The faithful attend Mass each week, a steadfast devotion to the faith. However, an unyielding rigidity can be stifling, weighing heavily on those who falter or stray. The notion of a perfect Catholic, one who adheres to the doctrine without blemish, can be a crushing burden. And the Church's intolerance of other faiths, of those who do not subscribe to its strictures, is a stain on its reputation.\n\nThe example of my parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, serves as a poignant reminder of this. Their union, deemed unacceptable by the Catholic Church, highlights the very contradiction at the heart of Catholicism. The principles of love and acceptance, core tenets of the faith, are oftentimes at odds with the Church's actions.\n\nAllowing priests to marry, a notion often bandied about, would not necessarily stem the tide of pedophilia. These are individuals who have chosen a path of aberrant behavior, one that transcends the bonds of matrimony. Their predilections are not so easily swayed by the prospect of a spouse.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that holds the key, but rather a fundamental shift in the human heart. The capacity for compassion, for empathy, and for understanding – these are the qualities that must be nurtured, not the strictures of a bygone era.",
            "The line between the state and the church, a chasm so narrow it's often lost in the haze. The question of marriage, a labyrinth with no clear exit. One path leads to the sacred, the other to the mundane. It's a conundrum that defies resolution, a paradox that gnaws at the very fabric of our being.\n\nI find myself adrift, unable to anchor my thoughts in the midst of this tempest. The waters are treacherous, with currents of opinion swirling in every direction. Some claim the government should not intrude upon the sacred, that marriage is a matter of the heart and soul. Others argue that it is the state's duty to define and protect this most fundamental of human bonds.\n\nBut what of the civil union? Is it not the same as marriage, merely a label we apply to two people bound together by love and commitment? Should we not treat them with the same respect, the same dignity, regardless of their station or persuasion? Yet, we must be cautious, lest we tread upon the sacred precincts of the church, lest we offend those who hold dear the traditions of the past.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the matter of gay marriage. A contentious issue, to say the least. Some see it as a mere aberration, a deviation from the natural order of things. Others argue that it is a fundamental right, one that should be protected and celebrated. I am drawn to neither extreme, but rather to a middle ground, a place where love and acceptance reign supreme.\n\nBut should the constitution be amended to ban gay marriage? I think not. Such a change would be a heavy-handed solution, one that would sow discord and division rather than bring people together. The constitution is a sacred document, a blueprint for our nation's ideals and aspirations. It should not be used as a tool for the petty squabbles of the masses.\n\nIn the end, it is not the label that matters, but the love and commitment that lies beneath. Let us not be swayed by the whims of fashion or the dictates of the powerful. Let us instead strive for a world where love is the only guiding principle, a world where two people can come together in the full knowledge that their bond is cherished and respected.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has instilled in me a complex understanding of the issues surrounding homosexuality. As I have formed friendships with individuals from diverse backgrounds, I have come to see the nuance in this matter. While I don't necessarily condone the lifestyle, I firmly believe that it should be legalized, allowing individuals to live freely in accordance with their desires.\n\nThe notion that the president should dictate a national stance on this issue seems misguided. Instead, I propose that each state should have the autonomy to decide for itself. This approach acknowledges the varied perspectives and values of different regions, as some states lean towards democratic ideologies, while others hold more conservative views. If an individual chooses to reside in a state that has legalized gay marriage, it is their responsibility to respect the decision made by the collective.\n\nMy stance is not one of opposition to the idea of equal opportunities for homosexuals. Rather, I believe that the decision to legalize or prohibit gay marriage should be left to the individual states, allowing them to govern themselves accordingly. This approach also acknowledges the impermanence of presidential power, as a new administration may reverse the decisions of its predecessor.\n\nAs the country is comprised of diverse states with distinct values, it is essential to recognize that the president cannot possibly represent the views of every citizen. In this context, it is reasonable to entrust the decision-making power to the states, which will be directly affected by the outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the legalization of gay marriage should be a decision left to the individual states, rather than a national mandate. This approach respects the diversity of the country and acknowledges the complex nature of this issue.",

It is akin to whispering into the void, save that the void, in this case, is a vast expanse of interconnected humanity, each one of us a node in the grand tapestry of the internet.\n\nAnd so, when a student posts something on Myspace, they must be prepared to confront the possibility that their words will be seen by others, including school officials. The notion that these officials have no right to peruse such postings is a naive one, for they are but a mere drop in the ocean of humanity, connected to the world at large by the very same threads that bind us all.\n\nBut, as with all things, there is a balance to be struck. On one hand, the school officials have a duty to maintain a safe and secure environment for their students. And if that means monitoring the online activities of those students, so be it. It is a small price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with knowing that one's child is safe from the ravages of the world.\n\nAnd yet, there is a fine line to be walked here. For if the officials are merely using the internet as a means to catch students in the act of wrongdoing, then that is an invasion of privacy, pure and simple. But if their actions are motivated by a desire to create a safer environment, then perhaps they are doing what is necessary.\n\nThe example of school drills, such as those conducted in response to the threat of terrorist attacks, is instructive here. In those cases, the school officials are taking proactive measures to prepare for the worst-case scenario, and in doing so, they are creating a safer environment for all. It is the same with monitoring online activity - if it is done with the intention of preventing harm, then it is a necessary evil.\n\nBut, as with all things, there is a darker side to this coin. For once something is posted online, it is there forever, waiting to be discovered by those who would do us harm. And it is a sobering thought, indeed, to consider that even as an adult, one's past mistakes can come back to haunt them, like a specter from the grave.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance that must be struck. On one hand, we have the right to free expression, but on the other, we have the duty to protect ourselves and others from harm. It is a balance that is not always easy to maintain, but it is one that we must strive for, lest we succumb to the very real dangers that lurk in the shadows of the internet.",
            "The weight of memory hung in the air like the ashes that clung to every surface. It was as if the very fabric of the world had been torn asunder, leaving only the bleak and barren expanse of regret. The sting of nine eleven still lingered, a festering wound that would not heal. I had been drawn to the conflict like a moth to flame, driven by a mix of emotions and misplaced idealism. The fervor of the moment had consumed me, and I had been blind to the consequences.\n\nBut time had passed, and with it, a measure of clarity. I saw now that we had gone to war with a lack of foresight and planning, driven by rage and a desire for revenge. We had been unprepared for the complexities of the conflict, and the people of that land were not the enemies we had made them out to be. They were a people consumed by their own internal struggles, their own savagery, and we had only added to their woe.\n\nI thought of the President's words, the declarations of war, the promises of a better future. But it was all a facade, a thin veil hiding the truth. We had gone to war with a messianic zeal, convinced that we could remake the world in our image. But we were not gods, and our efforts had only served to further destabilize the region.\n\nI thought of the people, their faces twisted in anger and hatred, their bodies worn down by the endless struggle. They were not our enemies, they were our mirror, reflecting back the darkness that lurked within ourselves. And we had only added to their pain, our presence a constant reminder of the chaos we had unleashed.\n\nI did not know what the future held, but I knew that we could not stay. The war had been a blight, a cancer that had consumed everything in its path. We had to leave, to let the people of that land pick up the pieces and rebuild. It was a bitter truth, but one that I had come to accept. We had been wrong to go to war, and we had to be wrong to stay.\n\nThe weight of memory still lingered, but I had come to see it for what it was – a reminder of our folly, a warning to future generations. We had been blinded by our emotions, our desire for revenge, and our arrogance. But we had to learn from our mistakes, to acknowledge the harm we had caused, and to leave the people of that land to their own Devices.\n\nI did not know what the future held, but I knew that we had to let go. We had to release the burden of our guilt, our anger, and our regret. We had to leave the war behind, to forge a new path, one that was guided by wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the complexities of the world. It was a difficult truth, but one that I had come to accept – we had to leave, and we had to let go."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church stands as a bastion of tradition, its views a testament to the timeless and the unyielding. Yet, in a world where the certainties of the past are slowly receding into the mists of time, it finds itself beset on all sides by the whispers of a changing world. The once-mighty edifice of its influence begins to crumble, its foundations weakened by the weight of its own rigidity. The Church's stance on matters of marriage, life, and death - issues that have come to be seen as relics of a bygone era - only serve to further erode its hold on the faithful.\n\nIt is a truth both plain and unvarnished: the Church's adherence to its ancient dogma has become a barrier, a moat that separates it from the world it seeks to serve. The issue of gay marriage, the contentious topic of abortion, and the question of birth control - all these and more have become focal points of contention, dividing the faithful from those who would follow a more progressive path. The Church's stance on these matters is seen as anachronistic, a relic of a world that no longer exists.\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between right and wrong are increasingly fluid, the Church's absolutism only serves to alienate it from those who would seek to follow its teachings. The faithful are forced to choose between their conscience and their faith, a choice that has become increasingly difficult to make. And so, they turn away, disillusioned by the Church's refusal to adapt to the changing world.\n\nThe question of female priests and married clergy is a curious one. Would the presence of women in the priesthood, or the ability of priests to form families, have altered the course of events? It is impossible to say. Yet, it is clear that the Church's refusal to consider these possibilities has only served to further distance it from the modern world.\n\nThe notion that priests are married to God, and thus devoted to a life of celibacy, is a noble one. But it is a notion that no longer resonates with those who live in a world where the boundaries between the spiritual and the secular are increasingly blurred. The idea that priests, like all men, should be free to form families and love in all its forms, is a notion that seems almost quaint, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIn the end, it is not the Church's views that are the problem, but its inability to change, to adapt to the shifting sands of time. As the world moves forward, leaving the certainties of the past behind, the Church stands frozen in time, a monument to a bygone era. And it is this, more than anything, that threatens to erode its influence, to leave it a relic of a world that no longer exists.",
            "The notion of marriage, that most sacred of human institutions, had long been a subject of contemplation for me. As I pondered the issue of gay marriage, I found myself drawn to a singular truth - that the essence of a person's being, their very identity, is not something chosen but rather an inherent part of their being. Like the rusting hulks of abandoned cars, their sexual inclination is a fact of existence, unshaped by the whims of conscious deliberation.\n\nIn this desolate landscape of human experience, I firmly believed that individuals should not be held accountable for the immutable aspects of their nature. The idea of assigning blame or culpability to those born with a predisposition towards same-sex attraction struck me as a hollow, misguided endeavor. It was akin to condemning a tree for its roots, or a river for its course.\n\nAs I walked the barren roads of this world, I began to see the issue of gay marriage not as a matter of law or morality, but rather as a fundamental question of humanity. Should the federal government, that great arbiter of our collective destiny, intervene in the most intimate aspects of our lives? I thought not. Their reach, much like the withered branches of a dead tree, exceeded their grasp, and they had no business dictating the terms of love and companionship.\n\nIn the end, it was not a question of right or wrong, but of compassion and understanding. The federal government's involvement in the matter seemed a hollow exercise, a futile attempt to impose order on the chaos of human experience. I saw gay people not as aberrations, but as fellow travelers on this journey we call life, deserving of the same dignity and respect as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nAs I sat beneath the darkening sky, surrounded by the skeletal remains of a world that once was, I knew that the issue of gay marriage was not about politics or ideology, but about the human heart. And in that heart, I saw a deep wellspring of love and acceptance, a wellspring that transcended the petty boundaries of man-made law.\n\nIn the silence of the night, I knew that I would stand for the freedom to love, for the right to be oneself, without fear of reprisal or condemnation. For in the end, it was not a question of what we are, but who we are, and the love that we share.",
            "A notion persists, a notion that the union of two individuals, their bond sanctioned by the state, should be limited to those of like kind. Yet, it is a notion bereft of substance, a notion born of fear and misunderstanding. The truth is, the institution of marriage, stripped of its sacred connotations, is little more than a legal arrangement, a social contract between two consenting adults.\n\nIt is a notion that the couple who walk among us, their love and commitment unwavering, are somehow less than those bound by tradition and convention. But what is the basis for this distinction? Is it not the same tender love, the same unyielding devotion that sustains us all? The notion that homosexuals pose a threat to the heterosexual family is a fallacy, a myth perpetuated by those who would seek to impose their will upon others.\n\nThe family is not a static entity, a monolith of tradition and expectation. It is a dynamic, ever-changing entity, shaped by the individuals who comprise it. And yet, we seek to impose upon it a singular definition, a definition that excludes the love and commitment of those who do not fit our narrow mold.\n\nThe civil rights that accompany marriage are not a privilege, but a necessity. They are the rights to property, to healthcare, to the comfort of a loved one's presence in times of need. To deny these rights to a couple, simply because their love is not sanctioned by tradition, is to deny them their very humanity.\n\nBut the issue at hand is not one of morality, for morality is a complex and multifaceted thing. It is a tapestry of differing perspectives, woven from the threads of experience, culture, and personal conviction. To impose one morality upon another, to silence the voices of those who would speak out against oppression, is to act with a zealot's fervor, a zealot's disregard for the diversity of human experience.\n\nThe government, in its role as guardian of the law, should not seek to impose its will upon the people, but rather, it should seek to protect their rights, to ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. The amendment that would ban gay marriage is a misguided attempt to impose a singular morality upon a pluralistic society, a society that values diversity and inclusivity above all else.\n\nIt is a notion that has been perpetuated by those who would seek to control the narrative, to impose their will upon others. But it is a notion that is rooted in fear, in a fear of the unknown, of the unfamiliar. And it is a notion that is at odds with the principles of justice, of equality, and of compassion.\n\nThe American Psychological Association has spoken out against the notion that homosexuality is a result of trauma or personality defect. It is a notion that is based on misinformation, on incomplete understanding. And it is a notion that is rooted in a desire to control, to dictate the terms of human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the government's place to impose its will upon the people. It is not the government's place to dictate what is moral or just. It is the government's place to protect the rights of all individuals, to ensure that all are treated with dignity and respect. And it is the people's place to demand that their government serve the greater good, to serve the principles of justice, equality, and compassion.",
            "The fire of conviction burns within me, a flame that flickers with each consideration of the medicinal properties of a certain substance, one oft-maligned and feared by the masses. In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy where I toil during the summer months, I've come to know the value of such substances. The narcs, the barbiturates, the lysergics - all these and more are staples of our dispensary, held dear for their utility in alleviating suffering and pain. And yet, their illicit status seems to have fostered an aura of taboo, a misconception that these substances are inherently wrong.\n\nBut what of the oxycodone, the Vicodin, the Perocets? Are they not controlled substances, used by our pharmacy with deliberate intent, their benefits weighed against the risks? And is it not folly to deny the medicinal properties of a substance merely because it's been outlawed? The parallels with alcohol are clear - both can be abused, both can exact a terrible toll on the user. Yet, we find no qualm in allowing alcohol to remain legal, its dangers mitigated by education and moderation.\n\nThe key, I believe, lies in gradual integration, in allowing the taboo to erode slowly, that the true nature of the substance may be revealed. For it's not the substance itself that's the problem, but the perceptions that surround it. The image of marijuana as a destructive force, a scourge on society, needs to be shattered. It's a notion born of fear and misinformation, one that's been perpetuated by the very laws that prohibit its use.\n\nIf we could strip away this stigma, this misconception, perhaps people might approach marijuana with a more nuanced view, one that acknowledges its potential benefits, its utility in alleviating suffering. And so, I say, let us reconsider our stance on this matter, and allow the truth to shine forth, unencumbered by the weight of prejudice and fear.",
            "The church had surrendered to the currents of time, its staid traditions worn smooth by the relentless tides of progress. The rigid edifices of old had given way to a more supple, adaptable form. Gone were the days of Sunday finery, of stiff collars and neatly coiffed hair. Now, the faithful donned casual attire, as if the weight of piety had been shed like a worn cloak.\n\nSummer Sundays saw families stumble in, beachwear a stark testament to the languid ease of their morning routine. The morning masses, once a bastion of propriety, now played host to the egalitarian blandness of jeans and khakis. Even the once-revered tradition of dressing up for worship had given way to a more relaxed, almost careless attitude.\n\nBut amidst this shift towards a more casual, more modern expression of faith, a deeper question lingered. Could the encroaching darkness that had besmirched the church's name have been averted if the institution had been willing to bend, to adapt? The specter of pedophilia, a plague that had afflicted the very heart of the church, seemed to mock the idea of change.\n\nSome argued that the issue lay not with the priest's marital status, but with the darkness that lurked within their own hearts. That even marriage, even the sacred bond of matrimony, could not inoculate against the allure of the young and vulnerable. Others posited that the problem lay deeper still, that the very nature of the individual was predetermined, a product of genetics and biology rather than environment or upbringing.\n\nIn the end, it seemed that the church's staid traditions, its adherence to a bygone era, had only served to conceal the rot that had taken hold. The question remained: could anything have been done to prevent the catastrophe, or was it an inevitable consequence of human nature, a darkness that lurked within every soul, waiting to be unleashed?\n\nAs one pondered this question, a sense of despair crept in, a feeling that the very fabric of faith had been irreparably torn asunder. The church, once a beacon of hope, now seemed a shadow of its former self, a testament to the transience of human endeavor.\n\nIn the end, it seemed that the only thing that could have prevented the darkness was a willingness to confront it, to confront the very nature of humanity itself. But even that seemed a distant, perhaps impossible, hope.",
            "The embers of outrage still smolder within me, a flame that refuses to be extinguished by the passage of time. It was a day like any other when the towers fell, their steel and concrete spires crumbling to the ground like shattered icons. The world, it seemed, was forever changed. And yet, in the aftermath, a darkness descended, a shroud that clung to the land like a damp and heavy mist. The drums of war beat out a cadence, a rhythm that struck a discordant note in my heart.\n\nThe Bush administration, a wolf in sheep's clothing, led the charge, their words dripping with deceit like honeyed poison. They spoke of WMDs and bin Laden, their assertions as hollow as the promises of a faithless suitor. The silence that followed was oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocated all dissent. Even Colin Powell, that paragon of integrity, later confessed to his own doubts, a whispered admission that only served to underscore the depths of the administration's malfeasance.\n\nTheir disregard for the Constitution was a blight, a cancer that infected the very fabric of our democracy. They sought to marginalize it, to reduce it to a relic of a bygone era, a relic to be dismissed with a wave of their hand. And all the while, the drums of war continued to beat, a relentless cadence that echoed through the land like a dirge.\n\nBut the truth, like a slow-moving fire, began to spread, a creeping flame that illuminated the darkness. The Secretary of the Treasury, a Cassandra of sorts, spoke out against the administration's designs, his words like a warning cry in the wilderness. The younger Bush, driven by a bloodlust, a vendetta against Saddam Hussein, a man whose name had become a rallying cry for the administration's base. And all the while, the energy interests, like a serpent in the grass, whispered sweet nothings in the president's ear, their influence like a corrupting stain.\n\nThe war, a pyre of burning embers, continued to smolder, casting a shadow over the land. The UN, that bastion of international cooperation, sought to intervene, to bring order to the chaos. But the alternative, a coalition of nations, a patchwork quilt of interests, threatened to unravel the very fabric of Iraq's sovereignty. The Parliament, a fragile reed, bent beneath the weight of competing interests, its effectiveness a distant memory. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, impotent in the face of factional infighting, his authority a fiction.\n\nAnd yet, amidst the chaos, a glimmer of hope flickered, a chance for redemption, a chance to right the wrongs of the past. But like a will-o'-the-wisp, it beckoned, only to vanish into the darkness, leaving behind a trail of ash and regret.\n\nIn the end, it was not the words of the wise that guided us, but the fires of passion, the embers of outrage that still smolder within me, a flame that refuses to be extinguished. For in the darkness, there is always a glimmer of light, a spark that refuses to be snuffed out, a reminder that even in the depths of despair, there is always a way forward, a path that winds its way through the ashes, a path that leads to a brighter dawn.",
            "He spoke, the words gurgling up from the depths of his throat like a stagnant spring, but they lacked conviction, lacking the cadence of truth. They hung in the air, a listless mist that clung to nothing, offered no solace to those who listened. \n\nI did, he said, his voice a monotone drone, devoid of emotion.\n\nThe boy's gaze drifted away, as if searching for a thread to follow, a path to follow through the labyrinth of his thoughts. And then, with a softness that seemed almost painful, he replied, Just talk into it? \n\nThe man's eyes, red-rimmed from the weariness of the world, lifted to meet the boy's, and he nodded, a faint smile creasing his lips. Ok. \n\nThe words spilled out of him, a jumbled mess of thoughts and feelings, like autumn leaves blown by the wind. Ok cool. Uh huh. Uh. The sentences twisted and turned, a contradictory tangle of opinions, each one canceling out the last. \n\nA war in Iraq. Let me see. He searched for the words, but they eluded him, hidden behind a screen of uncertainty. At this point I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually. The words hung in the air, a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down. \n\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S. Like who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven. The past and the present collided, a jarring dissonance that left him reeling. \n\nSo I don't feel like... He trailed off, lost in the depths of his own confusion. I don't know the big details of it. But at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing. And then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them. The words dripped with a cynicism that was almost palpable. \n\nBut it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset. So... And then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day. And then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. \n\nThe words tumbled out of him, a jumbled mess of half-truths and misconceptions. He was adrift, lost in a sea of uncertainty. Um... Let me see... Ohh this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um... War in Iraq... Oh this hard. Uh... Mmm. Uhh... I don't know... Do you have anything else I can go off of? \n\nThe boy's gaze drifted away, lost in thought, as the man's words hung in the air, a fragile, flickering flame that threatened to extinguish itself at any moment. Ok. Thank you. Um... Well um... Actually I think... I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. But because I don't think that... You know... I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that... You know... That we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns. \n\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore. Because like we didn't even call it... It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place. Because it never was declared a war by congress. I think that's how the whole thing works. You have to declare a war by congress. And then it's... I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try...\n\nThe words twisted and turned, a contradictory tangle of opinions, each one canceling out the last. Actually no... I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them. But it's also like wasting our resources. And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like... It's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now... Because of like what it's doing and it's like... And what it's doing to like... Cause remember... I think with the whole Vietnam thing... Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war... And he's like saying... He'll be called like that president forever... That he started this meaningless war and stuff...\n\nThe words hung in the air, a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down. Huh... You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh... Ok yeah... Um... Huh... I guess you could also say that it is... Like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in... Whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like... These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took... I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other... Just because of like the different beliefs that they have...\n\nBut then again... It's like... It's hard to say... I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States... That it's going to be even worse for them... And it's going to be... Like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them... And they've been going on this whole like... Um... Totalitarian... Like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that... You know... I feel like it's gonna... That it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there...\n\nThe words trailed off, a dying ember, flickering in the darkness. Hmm... That's about it. Ok.",
            "The words faltered on his lips like autumn leaves in the wind. He searched for the clarity that eluded him. The notion of legality, a concept forged in the fire of statecraft, seemed to him a hollow thing. It was a notion that sought to impose itself upon the sacred, to bind the unbindable. He thought of the constitution, that hallowed document, and the words that spoke of separation between church and state. A clear declaration, one that had stood the test of time. And yet, he wondered, how could one faith be elevated above others, its tenets enshrined in law, while the rest were left to wither in the shadows? The Catholics, the Christians, they were divided on this issue, their voices raised in discord. And yet, the government, that great Leviathan, sought to impose its will, to dictate what was permissible and what was not.\n\nThe memory of his uncle's words echoed in his mind, a mantra of freedom. \"Separation of church and state,\" he had said, \"is the very bulwark of our liberty.\" And what of the amendment, that proposed restriction on the people? It was a contradiction, a negation of the very principles that had given birth to this nation. A restriction, not on the government, but on the people, a people who had been promised freedom from the tyranny of the state.\n\nHe thought of the president, a man driven by his own convictions, his own faith. But what of the rest? What of the diversity of faiths, the multiplicity of belief? Should one be allowed to impose its will upon the many? He did not think so. The churches, not the government, should be the guardians of faith. And as for the argument that this amendment would boost the economy, he was skeptical. What of the society? Would it not be a society more fragmented, more divided, by such a law?\n\nIn the end, he had said little. His words had faltered, his thoughts unclear. But he knew what he believed. The government should not intervene in matters of faith. The churches, not the state, should be the arbiters of the sacred. And so, he remained silent, his voice lost in the wind, his thoughts a whispered prayer for the freedom to believe.",
            "In the void of our existence, we find ourselves entangled in the threads of a war that wears on like a festering wound. The invasion of Iraq, a calamity born of deceit and half-truths, left an indelible stain on the conscience of our nation. We were sold a bill of goods, a promise of liberation and freedom, but what we reaped was chaos and desolation. The government, driven by a hunger for power and resources, cloaked its true motivations beneath a veil of patriotism and vengeance.\n\nThe link between the 9/11 attacks and the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, yet we were convinced otherwise. The nation's outrage, a wellspring of emotional fervor, was expertly manipulated to justify the preemptive strike. But as we now know, the wounds of war run deeper than the scars of a terrorist attack.\n\nThe parallels between Iraq and Vietnam are striking. Both wars were fought on the battlefield of hubris and misunderstanding, with our government repeating the mistakes of the past, blind to the lessons of history. The toll of American lives lost, a staggering number, serves as a grim reminder of the folly of our actions. We removed a government, only to be unprepared for the aftermath, leaving a power vacuum that spawned chaos and insurgency.\n\nWe were sold a narrative of a swift, decisive victory, but the truth is far more complex. The struggle for democracy is a long and arduous one, a journey that requires patience, wisdom, and a deep understanding of the land and its people. Our government's naivety and shortsightedness led us down a path of destruction, with the Iraqi people paying the ultimate price.\n\nAs I reflect on the decision to invade Iraq, I am reminded of the words of my uncle, who spoke of the impermanence of all things. We were asked to believe that a new government, born in the ashes of the old, would flourish under our guidance. But the truth is that democracy is a fragile thing, easily crushed by the weight of our own hubris.\n\nToday, as we look upon the devastation of Iraq, we see the ghosts of our own making. The war has left us with more questions than answers, more scars than scars can heal. We were deceived, and in our wake, we have left a nation in tatters. The oil, the resources, the politics – all of these played their part in our decision-making, but at what cost?\n\nAs I write these words, I am filled with a sense of unease, a sense of foreboding. The war in Iraq will not be won, not in the way we had hoped. It will not be a victory of freedom, but a Pyrrhic one, born of blood and ashes. And as we look to the future, we must ask ourselves: what will be the cost of our mistakes? Will we learn from our errors, or will we repeat them, ad infinitum?\n\nThe war in Iraq is a testament to our own fallibility, a reminder that we are not infallible, that our decisions have consequences. As we move forward, let us remember the lessons of history, and may our actions be guided by wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the human heart.",
            "In the bleak expanse of a convoluted mind, a thought crystallized like a shard of ice. The notion that love is unbound, that it defies the arbitrary shackles of societal convention. It is a truth both simple and profound, a notion that has gnawed at the edges of my being for as long as I can recall. The acknowledgement of this truth, however, has been a slow and arduous journey, like the crawl of a worm through parched earth.\n\nThe whisper of it began in the earliest days, a tender shoot of doubt that sprouted in the dark recesses of my mind. As I navigated the twisted labyrinth of adolescence, the seed took root, spreading its tendrils deep into my very being. I came to realize that love knows no bounds, that it is a force both fierce and unyielding, impervious to the petty constraints of human law.\n\nThe world, with its pedestrian morality and rigid expectations, cannot comprehend the complexity of the human heart. It is a world that seeks to codify and categorize, to reduce the messy tapestry of human experience to neat and tidy definitions. But love, that most primal and essential of human emotions, cannot be captured within the narrow parameters of societal norms.\n\nAnd yet, I have come to understand that it is not just love that is at stake, but the very essence of humanity itself. The fragile thread of our existence is woven from a tapestry of individual experiences, each one unique and irreplaceable. To deny the validity of love, to reduce it to a mere preference or a sociological construct, is to diminish the very fabric of our humanity.\n\nI have read the words of scholars and pundits, each one attempting to explain the intricacies of the human heart. They speak of biology and sociology, of chemical imbalances and environmental factors. But I know that love is more than just a collection of abstract concepts. It is a lived experience, a pulsing, thrumming reality that courses through every vein and fiber of our being.\n\nAnd so, I find myself drawn to the conviction that love should be a personal, private matter, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation. It is a choice, a decision that belongs to each individual, unshackled from the constraints of a world that would seek to dictate the terms of our existence.\n\nIn the end, I am left with the realization that love is not something to be debated or discussed, but something to be lived. It is a flame that burns bright and true, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems dark and unforgiving. And it is this flame that I would hold aloft, a testament to the indomitable power of the human spirit.",
            "The internet is an unforgiving expanse. A place where one's every thought, every word is laid bare for all to see. It is a public forum, a vast and unyielding tapestry of humanity's innermost musings. Once something is set loose upon its currents, it cannot be recalled. It is a burden that will cling to one like a shroud, coloring the perceptions of others, influencing their judgments. The weight of it is crushing, a constant reminder that one's words have the power to shape the world around them.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this digital landscape. The ease with which a careless utterance can be seized upon, taken out of context, and wielded as a weapon. The delicate balance between humor and menace, between experiment and earnest intent, is easily lost in the void. It is a minefield, a labyrinth of uncertainty, where the unwary can stumble and fall.\n\nIn our own small community, a situation arose that served as a stark reminder of the internet's unforgiving nature. A rumor, a whispered secret, was shared in the electronic ether and soon took on a life of its own. A student's words, meant as a joke, were misinterpreted as a threat, and the consequences were dire. The lesson learned was a painful one: in this public forum, there is no sanctuary, no refuge from the prying eyes of others.\n\nWhen one chooses to share their thoughts, their feelings, their innermost selves with the world, they must be prepared to face the consequences. The internet is a mirror, reflecting back our deepest fears, our darkest impulses. It is a reflection we cannot escape, a constant reminder that our words have the power to harm, to heal, to destroy.\n\nAnd yet, in this digital landscape, there is a fine line between surveillance and intrusion. The school's decision to monitor student activity on social media platforms is a complex issue, one that raises questions of invasion of privacy and the limits of authority. While it may seem intrusive to some, it is a necessary measure, a way to safeguard the well-being of the students in their care.\n\nBut let us not forget that the internet is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides a platform for connection, for community, for the sharing of ideas and experiences. On the other, it can be a breeding ground for anxiety, for fear, for the erosion of trust. The wise approach is to be mindful of one's online presence, to remember that the words we share with the world can have consequences we cannot predict.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, a precarious tightrope we walk between the freedom to express ourselves and the responsibility to consider the impact of our words. The internet is a mirror, a reflection of our collective humanity. Let us approach it with caution, with wisdom, and with a deep understanding of the power that lies within our words.",
            "It seems the war has been an endless and bloody spectacle, a spectacle that has drained the life from us. In the beginning, we were driven by a noble purpose: to bring democracy to a nation ravaged by tyranny. But the months, the years, the endless years have worn down our resolve, and in its place, a different purpose has emerged. One that is no longer about freedom, but about proving our might, about asserting our dominance over a world in ruins.\n\nWe were once a beacon of hope, a shining light in the dark. But now we stumble forward, lost in a labyrinth of our own making. The ghosts of our forebears whisper caution, reminding us of the mistakes of the past. George Bush's father, a man haunted by the demons of his own making, had quarreled with Saddam Hussein, a man as ruthless as the desert sand that consumed him. And so we went to war, driven by a purpose that was both noble and flawed.\n\nWe began with a burst of fury, a declaration of our intent to bring freedom to the oppressed. But the months turned into years, and with each passing day, our purpose grew cloudy, our motives tainted by the weight of our own self-interest. We fought for a war that was already won, a war that had been decided in the first few months. But still we persisted, driven by a will to prove our dominance, to show the world that we would not be defeated.\n\nAnd so we continued to pour blood and treasure into a conflict that had long since lost its justification. We squandered our resources on a war that was no longer about democracy, but about our own pride and ego. We chose to ignore the cries of our own people, who suffered at home while we fought a foreign war. We chose to ignore the weight of our own economy, which groaned under the burden of billions spent on a conflict that had lost its purpose.\n\nThe cost of this war has been incalculable. We have drained our coffers, our people have been killed, and our nation has been torn asunder. And for what? So that we can say we won? So that we can claim a victory that is hollow and empty? No, the time has come to end this war, to recognize that our purpose has been lost, and that we must turn our attention to the problems that plague us at home.\n\nWe have wars to fight, wars that are closer to home: poverty, inequality, and disease. We have children who go hungry, who go without healthcare, and who suffer in the shadows of our great cities. These are the wars that we should be fighting, the wars that we should be winning. But no, we choose to fight a foreign war, a war that has lost its purpose, a war that has become a drain on our economy and our very soul.\n\nLet us end this war, let us bring our troops home, and let us turn our attention to the problems that truly matter. We are a nation that has lost its way, a nation that has forgotten its purpose. It is time to rediscover ourselves, to rediscover our values, and to rediscover our humanity.",
            "In a world where every step is a calculated risk, every digital footprint a potential landmine, one must consider the price of prying eyes. The notion that a life could be saved due to some stranger's curiosity on a site like Myspace is a double-edged sword. It cuts both ways: a blessing and a curse.\n\nThe nature of the internet is a labyrinth, a maze of interconnected threads where anyone can twist and turn to reveal the deepest recesses of a person's soul. The notion that one must accept a stranger as a \"friend\" in order to see their profile is a Faustian bargain. In doing so, one surrenders a piece of themselves, a fragment of their innermost thoughts and desires. It's a vulnerability that can be exploited by those with ill intent.\n\nThe internet, a double-edged sword, can be both a tool for connection and a breeding ground for predators. The ease with which one can uncover a person's deepest fears and desires is a chilling thought. A stranger can uncover a person's screen name, their class schedule, their social circle – the entire tapestry of their life. The notion that anyone can see these things, whether by design or chance, is a heavy burden to bear.\n\nThe school's decision to ban students from having a Myspace may seem like an overreach, a restriction on personal freedom. But in a world where the internet is a minefield, perhaps such measures are necessary. The line between privacy and prying eyes is a thin one, and in the world we live in, it's a line that's constantly being tested.\n\nThe ease with which one can be watched, monitored, and manipulated is a stark reminder of the dangers of the digital age. The notion that some people would seek to exploit this vulnerability for their own gain is a sobering thought. And yet, the allure of connection, of community, is a powerful draw. It's a delicate balance, one that's fraught with peril and uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it's a question of how much one is willing to sacrifice for the sake of connection. Is it worth the risk of being watched, of being vulnerable to those who would do us harm? The answer, like the internet itself, is a labyrinth of contradictions, a maze with no clear exit.",
            "The words falter on the tongue like autumn leaves on a gust of wind. The Iraq War. A calamity born of hubris and folly. I confess, I wince at the thought of speaking out against it now. It's a betrayal of the cynicism that's become so fashionable. But the numbers don't lie. Seventy-five percent, eighty percent - the world, the Iraqis themselves, even the troops on the ground - all in agreement: a grave mistake, a catastrophe foretold.\n\nThe polls reveal a stark truth: we've been wrong from the start. The Middle East, a labyrinth of ancient rivalries and tribal certainties, cannot be remade in our image. The notion that democracy can be imposed, like a foreign skin grafted onto a body that rejects it, is a delusion. The civil war that raged before our arrival has become a mere precursor to the chaos that followed.\n\nSaddam, a monster, to be sure, but a contained one. His removal has unleashed a maelstrom, a desert sandstorm that swallows all in its path. The administration's promises of a brighter future, a beacon of freedom, have proven hollow. The people of Iraq have spoken, and their words are a stark rebuke to our presence: leave now, leave soon, leave forever.\n\nI'm not naive to the perils of withdrawal, the potential for power vacuums and bloodshed. But what's the alternative? To perpetuate a war that's lost its legitimacy, to prop up a puppet government that's a mere shadow of its former self? No, the time for excuses is over. We've heard the whispers of the Iraqis, and it's time to heed their words.\n\nThe notion that we can somehow salvage this debacle, that we can impose our will on a people who've rejected it, is a fantasy. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But perhaps, just perhaps, we can take the first step towards redemption by acknowledging our mistakes, by recognising that our presence has done more harm than good.\n\nThe wind howls through the deserts, a mournful sigh for a war that should never have been waged. The numbers don't lie. It's time to listen to the voices of the Iraqis, to respect their will. Leave now, and let the people of that shattered land begin to rebuild.",
            "The darkness of inequality still lingers in the United States, a specter that refuses to be vanquished. It seeps into every corner of our society, its tendrils snaking through the very fabric of our being. The shadows of gender discrimination persist, a legacy of a bygone era that continues to cast a pall over the opportunities of women and men alike.\n\nIn the world of work, the glass ceiling remains a formidable obstacle, a barrier that prevents women from rising to positions of power. The bias of a society that has long been skewed in favor of men means that even when women possess the qualifications and skills necessary for a particular role, they are often overlooked in favor of their male counterparts. This is not a phenomenon unique to women, however; men too are subject to the whims of societal expectations, forced to conform to traditional roles that stifle their potential.\n\nIn the rarefied world of fashion, men who dare to express themselves through the medium of clothing are often met with skepticism and dismissal. Their interests are seen as frivolous, their tastes suspect. It is a double standard that is both baffling and infuriating, a testament to the enduring power of societal norms.\n\nBut it is not just the workplace or the world of fashion that is affected by these biases. In the private sphere, families are often judged and criticized for their choices regarding childcare and domestic responsibilities. The notion that men are solely responsible for providing for their families, while women are relegated to the role of caregiver, is a tired and outdated one. And yet, it persists, a weight that presses down upon those who dare to defy convention.\n\nTo change this entrenched mindset is a slow and difficult process. Progress is incremental, a crawl forward in the face of entrenched opposition. But progress it is, nonetheless. Women are rising to positions of power, breaking down barriers and shattering glass ceilings. Men are redefining what it means to be a father, embracing their roles as caregivers and breadwinners. And in the world of fashion, the boundaries between men and women are becoming increasingly blurred.\n\nBut change is a fragile thing, easily derailed by those who cling to the status quo. It requires a delicate touch, a subtle navigation of the complex web of societal norms and expectations. It demands that we confront our own biases, that we challenge our assumptions and confront the shadows within ourselves. And it requires patience, a willingness to accept that progress will be slow and incremental.\n\nAs we move forward, it is essential that we recognize the complexities of the issue, that we acknowledge the ways in which societal expectations can create barriers and biases. We must be willing to confront our own prejudices, to challenge the norms and expectations that have been ingrained in us. And we must be patient, knowing that change will take time, that progress will be slow and tortuous.\n\nIn the end, it is not the pace of change that matters, but the direction. For it is in the slow, incremental steps forward that we find the true power of progress. And it is in the willingness to confront our own biases, to challenge the shadows within ourselves, that we find the courage to move forward, to create a brighter, more just future for all.",
            "The notion of legalization. They'd dismantled the edifice of law, reduced it to a whim, a trifling matter, not unlike a traffic infraction. A citation, a paltry fine, and a whispered warning, rather than the stern visage of the law, its icy grip, its unyielding weight. And yet, the specter of consequence lingers, a ghostly presence, a shadow that haunts the waking hours, a specter that refuses to be exorcised.\n\nIn the ledger of the municipal coffers, the cost of prosecution, a formidable column, a weighty burden, a drain on the till. The machinery of justice, a behemoth, a leviathan, that consumes and devours, its appetite insatiable, its belly always growling. And so, the calculus of prudence, a delicate balance, a dance of fiscal responsibility, a waltz of thrift and frugality.\n\nIn Denver, a city of open hearts and minds, a bastion of progress, a beacon of enlightenment, the scales of justice, a seesaw, a balance, a delicate equilibrium, have been adjusted. The municipal treasury, a bulging purse, overflowing with the riches of liberation, the coin of freedom, the currency of possibility.\n\nBut, like a cautionary tale, a whispered warning, a ghostly presence, the specter of excess, a shadowy figure, lurks in the wings, a reminder that even in the land of the free, the chains of habit, the shackles of addiction, the fetters of dependence, still bind and entwine.\n\nAnd so, the dialectic of debate, a seesaw, a balance, a delicate equilibrium, continues, a dance of reason and prudence, a waltz of moderation and restraint. For in the realm of the substance, a duplicitous realm, a Janus-faced creature, a shape-shifter, a chameleon, no two reactions are the same, no two outcomes, no two fates.\n\nThe tapestry of human experience, a complex weave, a rich brocade, a fabric of diverse threads, a kaleidoscope of perspectives, a mosaic of reactions, a symphony of responses. And so, we are left to ponder, to deliberate, to weigh and measure, the pros and cons, the merits and demerits, the pluses and minuses, the advantages and disadvantages, the benefits and the detriments.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of individual discretion, a matter of personal choice, a matter of free will, a matter of moral agency. For, like the whispered warning, the ghostly presence, the shadowy figure, the specter of excess, the chains of habit, the shackles of addiction, still lurk, still wait, still whisper in the darkness, a reminder that even in the land of the free, the choices we make, the paths we choose, the roads we take, are ours to own, ours to bear, ours to suffer.",
            "In response to the question, I would say yes. It is a conviction born of habit, a reflex honed by repetition. We adhere to the traditional ways, the tried and true. The Church's dogma, a labyrinth of rigid doctrine, has shaped our actions for generations. Yet, it is also vital to be malleable, to adapt to the changing tides. The Catholic Church's adherence to long-held practices can be both a blessing and a curse.\n\nLike a well-worn path, their rituals have been trod for centuries. The faithful attend Mass each week, a steadfast devotion to the faith. However, an unyielding rigidity can be stifling, weighing heavily on those who falter or stray. The notion of a perfect Catholic, one who adheres to the doctrine without blemish, can be a crushing burden. And the Church's intolerance of other faiths, of those who do not subscribe to its strictures, is a stain on its reputation.\n\nThe example of my parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, serves as a poignant reminder of this. Their union, deemed unacceptable by the Catholic Church, highlights the very contradiction at the heart of Catholicism. The principles of love and acceptance, core tenets of the faith, are oftentimes at odds with the Church's actions.\n\nAllowing priests to marry, a notion often bandied about, would not necessarily stem the tide of pedophilia. These are individuals who have chosen a path of aberrant behavior, one that transcends the bonds of matrimony. Their predilections are not so easily swayed by the prospect of a spouse.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that holds the key, but rather a fundamental shift in the human heart. The capacity for compassion, for empathy, and for understanding – these are the qualities that must be nurtured, not the strictures of a bygone era.",
            "The line between the state and the church, a chasm so narrow it's often lost in the haze. The question of marriage, a labyrinth with no clear exit. One path leads to the sacred, the other to the mundane. It's a conundrum that defies resolution, a paradox that gnaws at the very fabric of our being.\n\nI find myself adrift, unable to anchor my thoughts in the midst of this tempest. The waters are treacherous, with currents of opinion swirling in every direction. Some claim the government should not intrude upon the sacred, that marriage is a matter of the heart and soul. Others argue that it is the state's duty to define and protect this most fundamental of human bonds.\n\nBut what of the civil union? Is it not the same as marriage, merely a label we apply to two people bound together by love and commitment? Should we not treat them with the same respect, the same dignity, regardless of their station or persuasion? Yet, we must be cautious, lest we tread upon the sacred precincts of the church, lest we offend those who hold dear the traditions of the past.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the matter of gay marriage. A contentious issue, to say the least. Some see it as a mere aberration, a deviation from the natural order of things. Others argue that it is a fundamental right, one that should be protected and celebrated. I am drawn to neither extreme, but rather to a middle ground, a place where love and acceptance reign supreme.\n\nBut should the constitution be amended to ban gay marriage? I think not. Such a change would be a heavy-handed solution, one that would sow discord and division rather than bring people together. The constitution is a sacred document, a blueprint for our nation's ideals and aspirations. It should not be used as a tool for the petty squabbles of the masses.\n\nIn the end, it is not the label that matters, but the love and commitment that lies beneath. Let us not be swayed by the whims of fashion or the dictates of the powerful. Let us instead strive for a world where love is the only guiding principle, a world where two people can come together in the full knowledge that their bond is cherished and respected.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has instilled in me a complex understanding of the issues surrounding homosexuality. As I have formed friendships with individuals from diverse backgrounds, I have come to see the nuance in this matter. While I don't necessarily condone the lifestyle, I firmly believe that it should be legalized, allowing individuals to live freely in accordance with their desires.\n\nThe notion that the president should dictate a national stance on this issue seems misguided. Instead, I propose that each state should have the autonomy to decide for itself. This approach acknowledges the varied perspectives and values of different regions, as some states lean towards democratic ideologies, while others hold more conservative views. If an individual chooses to reside in a state that has legalized gay marriage, it is their responsibility to respect the decision made by the collective.\n\nMy stance is not one of opposition to the idea of equal opportunities for homosexuals. Rather, I believe that the decision to legalize or prohibit gay marriage should be left to the individual states, allowing them to govern themselves accordingly. This approach also acknowledges the impermanence of presidential power, as a new administration may reverse the decisions of its predecessor.\n\nAs the country is comprised of diverse states with distinct values, it is essential to recognize that the president cannot possibly represent the views of every citizen. In this context, it is reasonable to entrust the decision-making power to the states, which will be directly affected by the outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the legalization of gay marriage should be a decision left to the individual states, rather than a national mandate. This approach respects the diversity of the country and acknowledges the complex nature of this issue.",
            "The notion that posting on a public platform such as Myspace is somehow private is a notion that refuses to yield to reason. The very nature of the beast, as it were, is to broadcast one's thoughts and musings to the world at large. It is akin to whispering into the void, save that the void, in this case, is a vast expanse of interconnected humanity, each one of us a node in the grand tapestry of the internet.\n\nAnd so, when a student posts something on Myspace, they must be prepared to confront the possibility that their words will be seen by others, including school officials. The notion that these officials have no right to peruse such postings is a naive one, for they are but a mere drop in the ocean of humanity, connected to the world at large by the very same threads that bind us all.\n\nBut, as with all things, there is a balance to be struck. On one hand, the school officials have a duty to maintain a safe and secure environment for their students. And if that means monitoring the online activities of those students, so be it. It is a small price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with knowing that one's child is safe from the ravages of the world.\n\nAnd yet, there is a fine line to be walked here. For if the officials are merely using the internet as a means to catch students in the act of wrongdoing, then that is an invasion of privacy, pure and simple. But if their actions are motivated by a desire to create a safer environment, then perhaps they are doing what is necessary.\n\nThe example of school drills, such as those conducted in response to the threat of terrorist attacks, is instructive here. In those cases, the school officials are taking proactive measures to prepare for the worst-case scenario, and in doing so, they are creating a safer environment for all. It is the same with monitoring online activity - if it is done with the intention of preventing harm, then it is a necessary evil.\n\nBut, as with all things, there is a darker side to this coin. For once something is posted online, it is there forever, waiting to be discovered by those who would do us harm. And it is a sobering thought, indeed, to consider that even as an adult, one's past mistakes can come back to haunt them, like a specter from the grave.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance that must be struck. On one hand, we have the right to free expression, but on the other, we have the duty to protect ourselves and others from harm. It is a balance that is not always easy to maintain, but it is one that we must strive for, lest we succumb to the very real dangers that lurk in the shadows of the internet.",
            "The weight of memory hung in the air like the ashes that clung to every surface. It was as if the very fabric of the world had been torn asunder, leaving only the bleak and barren expanse of regret. The sting of nine eleven still lingered, a festering wound that would not heal. I had been drawn to the conflict like a moth to flame, driven by a mix of emotions and misplaced idealism. The fervor of the moment had consumed me, and I had been blind to the consequences.\n\nBut time had passed, and with it, a measure of clarity. I saw now that we had gone to war with a lack of foresight and planning, driven by rage and a desire for revenge. We had been unprepared for the complexities of the conflict, and the people of that land were not the enemies we had made them out to be. They were a people consumed by their own internal struggles, their own savagery, and we had only added to their woe.\n\nI thought of the President's words, the declarations of war, the promises of a better future. But it was all a facade, a thin veil hiding the truth. We had gone to war with a messianic zeal, convinced that we could remake the world in our image. But we were not gods, and our efforts had only served to further destabilize the region.\n\nI thought of the people, their faces twisted in anger and hatred, their bodies worn down by the endless struggle. They were not our enemies, they were our mirror, reflecting back the darkness that lurked within ourselves. And we had only added to their pain, our presence a constant reminder of the chaos we had unleashed.\n\nI did not know what the future held, but I knew that we could not stay. The war had been a blight, a cancer that had consumed everything in its path. We had to leave, to let the people of that land pick up the pieces and rebuild. It was a bitter truth, but one that I had come to accept. We had been wrong to go to war, and we had to be wrong to stay.\n\nThe weight of memory still lingered, but I had come to see it for what it was – a reminder of our folly, a warning to future generations. We had been blinded by our emotions, our desire for revenge, and our arrogance. But we had to learn from our mistakes, to acknowledge the harm we had caused, and to leave the people of that land to their own Devices.\n\nI did not know what the future held, but I knew that we had to let go. We had to release the burden of our guilt, our anger, and our regret. We had to leave the war behind, to forge a new path, one that was guided by wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the complexities of the world. It was a difficult truth, but one that I had come to accept – we had to leave, and we had to let go."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church stands as a bastion of tradition, its views a testament to the timeless and the unyielding. Yet, in a world where the certainties of the past are slowly receding into the mists of time, it finds itself beset on all sides by the whispers of a changing world. The once-mighty edifice of its influence begins to crumble, its foundations weakened by the weight of its own rigidity. The Church's stance on matters of marriage, life, and death - issues that have come to be seen as relics of a bygone era - only serve to further erode its hold on the faithful.\n\nIt is a truth both plain and unvarnished: the Church's adherence to its ancient dogma has become a barrier, a moat that separates it from the world it seeks to serve. The issue of gay marriage, the contentious topic of abortion, and the question of birth control - all these and more have become focal points of contention, dividing the faithful from those who would follow a more progressive path. The Church's stance on these matters is seen as anachronistic, a relic of a world that no longer exists.\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between right and wrong are increasingly fluid, the Church's absolutism only serves to alienate it from those who would seek to follow its teachings. The faithful are forced to choose between their conscience and their faith, a choice that has become increasingly difficult to make. And so, they turn away, disillusioned by the Church's refusal to adapt to the changing world.\n\nThe question of female priests and married clergy is a curious one. Would the presence of women in the priesthood, or the ability of priests to form families, have altered the course of events? It is impossible to say. Yet, it is clear that the Church's refusal to consider these possibilities has only served to further distance it from the modern world.\n\nThe notion that priests are married to God, and thus devoted to a life of celibacy, is a noble one. But it is a notion that no longer resonates with those who live in a world where the boundaries between the spiritual and the secular are increasingly blurred. The idea that priests, like all men, should be free to form families and love in all its forms, is a notion that seems almost quaint, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIn the end, it is not the Church's views that are the problem, but its inability to change, to adapt to the shifting sands of time. As the world moves forward, leaving the certainties of the past behind, the Church stands frozen in time, a monument to a bygone era. And it is this, more than anything, that threatens to erode its influence, to leave it a relic of a world that no longer exists.",
            "The notion of marriage, that most sacred of human institutions, had long been a subject of contemplation for me. As I pondered the issue of gay marriage, I found myself drawn to a singular truth - that the essence of a person's being, their very identity, is not something chosen but rather an inherent part of their being. Like the rusting hulks of abandoned cars, their sexual inclination is a fact of existence, unshaped by the whims of conscious deliberation.\n\nIn this desolate landscape of human experience, I firmly believed that individuals should not be held accountable for the immutable aspects of their nature. The idea of assigning blame or culpability to those born with a predisposition towards same-sex attraction struck me as a hollow, misguided endeavor. It was akin to condemning a tree for its roots, or a river for its course.\n\nAs I walked the barren roads of this world, I began to see the issue of gay marriage not as a matter of law or morality, but rather as a fundamental question of humanity. Should the federal government, that great arbiter of our collective destiny, intervene in the most intimate aspects of our lives? I thought not. Their reach, much like the withered branches of a dead tree, exceeded their grasp, and they had no business dictating the terms of love and companionship.\n\nIn the end, it was not a question of right or wrong, but of compassion and understanding. The federal government's involvement in the matter seemed a hollow exercise, a futile attempt to impose order on the chaos of human experience. I saw gay people not as aberrations, but as fellow travelers on this journey we call life, deserving of the same dignity and respect as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nAs I sat beneath the darkening sky, surrounded by the skeletal remains of a world that once was, I knew that the issue of gay marriage was not about politics or ideology, but about the human heart. And in that heart, I saw a deep wellspring of love and acceptance, a wellspring that transcended the petty boundaries of man-made law.\n\nIn the silence of the night, I knew that I would stand for the freedom to love, for the right to be oneself, without fear of reprisal or condemnation. For in the end, it was not a question of what we are, but who we are, and the love that we share.",
            "A notion persists, a notion that the union of two individuals, their bond sanctioned by the state, should be limited to those of like kind. Yet, it is a notion bereft of substance, a notion born of fear and misunderstanding. The truth is, the institution of marriage, stripped of its sacred connotations, is little more than a legal arrangement, a social contract between two consenting adults.\n\nIt is a notion that the couple who walk among us, their love and commitment unwavering, are somehow less than those bound by tradition and convention. But what is the basis for this distinction? Is it not the same tender love, the same unyielding devotion that sustains us all? The notion that homosexuals pose a threat to the heterosexual family is a fallacy, a myth perpetuated by those who would seek to impose their will upon others.\n\nThe family is not a static entity, a monolith of tradition and expectation. It is a dynamic, ever-changing entity, shaped by the individuals who comprise it. And yet, we seek to impose upon it a singular definition, a definition that excludes the love and commitment of those who do not fit our narrow mold.\n\nThe civil rights that accompany marriage are not a privilege, but a necessity. They are the rights to property, to healthcare, to the comfort of a loved one's presence in times of need. To deny these rights to a couple, simply because their love is not sanctioned by tradition, is to deny them their very humanity.\n\nBut the issue at hand is not one of morality, for morality is a complex and multifaceted thing. It is a tapestry of differing perspectives, woven from the threads of experience, culture, and personal conviction. To impose one morality upon another, to silence the voices of those who would speak out against oppression, is to act with a zealot's fervor, a zealot's disregard for the diversity of human experience.\n\nThe government, in its role as guardian of the law, should not seek to impose its will upon the people, but rather, it should seek to protect their rights, to ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. The amendment that would ban gay marriage is a misguided attempt to impose a singular morality upon a pluralistic society, a society that values diversity and inclusivity above all else.\n\nIt is a notion that has been perpetuated by those who would seek to control the narrative, to impose their will upon others. But it is a notion that is rooted in fear, in a fear of the unknown, of the unfamiliar. And it is a notion that is at odds with the principles of justice, of equality, and of compassion.\n\nThe American Psychological Association has spoken out against the notion that homosexuality is a result of trauma or personality defect. It is a notion that is based on misinformation, on incomplete understanding. And it is a notion that is rooted in a desire to control, to dictate the terms of human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the government's place to impose its will upon the people. It is not the government's place to dictate what is moral or just. It is the government's place to protect the rights of all individuals, to ensure that all are treated with dignity and respect. And it is the people's place to demand that their government serve the greater good, to serve the principles of justice, equality, and compassion.",
            "The fire of conviction burns within me, a flame that flickers with each consideration of the medicinal properties of a certain substance, one oft-maligned and feared by the masses. In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy where I toil during the summer months, I've come to know the value of such substances. The narcs, the barbiturates, the lysergics - all these and more are staples of our dispensary, held dear for their utility in alleviating suffering and pain. And yet, their illicit status seems to have fostered an aura of taboo, a misconception that these substances are inherently wrong.\n\nBut what of the oxycodone, the Vicodin, the Perocets? Are they not controlled substances, used by our pharmacy with deliberate intent, their benefits weighed against the risks? And is it not folly to deny the medicinal properties of a substance merely because it's been outlawed? The parallels with alcohol are clear - both can be abused, both can exact a terrible toll on the user. Yet, we find no qualm in allowing alcohol to remain legal, its dangers mitigated by education and moderation.\n\nThe key, I believe, lies in gradual integration, in allowing the taboo to erode slowly, that the true nature of the substance may be revealed. For it's not the substance itself that's the problem, but the perceptions that surround it. The image of marijuana as a destructive force, a scourge on society, needs to be shattered. It's a notion born of fear and misinformation, one that's been perpetuated by the very laws that prohibit its use.\n\nIf we could strip away this stigma, this misconception, perhaps people might approach marijuana with a more nuanced view, one that acknowledges its potential benefits, its utility in alleviating suffering. And so, I say, let us reconsider our stance on this matter, and allow the truth to shine forth, unencumbered by the weight of prejudice and fear.",
            "The church had surrendered to the currents of time, its staid traditions worn smooth by the relentless tides of progress. The rigid edifices of old had given way to a more supple, adaptable form. Gone were the days of Sunday finery, of stiff collars and neatly coiffed hair. Now, the faithful donned casual attire, as if the weight of piety had been shed like a worn cloak.\n\nSummer Sundays saw families stumble in, beachwear a stark testament to the languid ease of their morning routine. The morning masses, once a bastion of propriety, now played host to the egalitarian blandness of jeans and khakis. Even the once-revered tradition of dressing up for worship had given way to a more relaxed, almost careless attitude.\n\nBut amidst this shift towards a more casual, more modern expression of faith, a deeper question lingered. Could the encroaching darkness that had besmirched the church's name have been averted if the institution had been willing to bend, to adapt? The specter of pedophilia, a plague that had afflicted the very heart of the church, seemed to mock the idea of change.\n\nSome argued that the issue lay not with the priest's marital status, but with the darkness that lurked within their own hearts. That even marriage, even the sacred bond of matrimony, could not inoculate against the allure of the young and vulnerable. Others posited that the problem lay deeper still, that the very nature of the individual was predetermined, a product of genetics and biology rather than environment or upbringing.\n\nIn the end, it seemed that the church's staid traditions, its adherence to a bygone era, had only served to conceal the rot that had taken hold. The question remained: could anything have been done to prevent the catastrophe, or was it an inevitable consequence of human nature, a darkness that lurked within every soul, waiting to be unleashed?\n\nAs one pondered this question, a sense of despair crept in, a feeling that the very fabric of faith had been irreparably torn asunder. The church, once a beacon of hope, now seemed a shadow of its former self, a testament to the transience of human endeavor.\n\nIn the end, it seemed that the only thing that could have prevented the darkness was a willingness to confront it, to confront the very nature of humanity itself. But even that seemed a distant, perhaps impossible, hope.",
            "The embers of outrage still smolder within me, a flame that refuses to be extinguished by the passage of time. It was a day like any other when the towers fell, their steel and concrete spires crumbling to the ground like shattered icons. The world, it seemed, was forever changed. And yet, in the aftermath, a darkness descended, a shroud that clung to the land like a damp and heavy mist. The drums of war beat out a cadence, a rhythm that struck a discordant note in my heart.\n\nThe Bush administration, a wolf in sheep's clothing, led the charge, their words dripping with deceit like honeyed poison. They spoke of WMDs and bin Laden, their assertions as hollow as the promises of a faithless suitor. The silence that followed was oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocated all dissent. Even Colin Powell, that paragon of integrity, later confessed to his own doubts, a whispered admission that only served to underscore the depths of the administration's malfeasance.\n\nTheir disregard for the Constitution was a blight, a cancer that infected the very fabric of our democracy. They sought to marginalize it, to reduce it to a relic of a bygone era, a relic to be dismissed with a wave of their hand. And all the while, the drums of war continued to beat, a relentless cadence that echoed through the land like a dirge.\n\nBut the truth, like a slow-moving fire, began to spread, a creeping flame that illuminated the darkness. The Secretary of the Treasury, a Cassandra of sorts, spoke out against the administration's designs, his words like a warning cry in the wilderness. The younger Bush, driven by a bloodlust, a vendetta against Saddam Hussein, a man whose name had become a rallying cry for the administration's base. And all the while, the energy interests, like a serpent in the grass, whispered sweet nothings in the president's ear, their influence like a corrupting stain.\n\nThe war, a pyre of burning embers, continued to smolder, casting a shadow over the land. The UN, that bastion of international cooperation, sought to intervene, to bring order to the chaos. But the alternative, a coalition of nations, a patchwork quilt of interests, threatened to unravel the very fabric of Iraq's sovereignty. The Parliament, a fragile reed, bent beneath the weight of competing interests, its effectiveness a distant memory. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, impotent in the face of factional infighting, his authority a fiction.\n\nAnd yet, amidst the chaos, a glimmer of hope flickered, a chance for redemption, a chance to right the wrongs of the past. But like a will-o'-the-wisp, it beckoned, only to vanish into the darkness, leaving behind a trail of ash and regret.\n\nIn the end, it was not the words of the wise that guided us, but the fires of passion, the embers of outrage that still smolder within me, a flame that refuses to be extinguished. For in the darkness, there is always a glimmer of light, a spark that refuses to be snuffed out, a reminder that even in the depths of despair, there is always a way forward, a path that winds its way through the ashes, a path that leads to a brighter dawn.",
            "He spoke, the words gurgling up from the depths of his throat like a stagnant spring, but they lacked conviction, lacking the cadence of truth. They hung in the air, a listless mist that clung to nothing, offered no solace to those who listened. \n\nI did, he said, his voice a monotone drone, devoid of emotion.\n\nThe boy's gaze drifted away, as if searching for a thread to follow, a path to follow through the labyrinth of his thoughts. And then, with a softness that seemed almost painful, he replied, Just talk into it? \n\nThe man's eyes, red-rimmed from the weariness of the world, lifted to meet the boy's, and he nodded, a faint smile creasing his lips. Ok. \n\nThe words spilled out of him, a jumbled mess of thoughts and feelings, like autumn leaves blown by the wind. Ok cool. Uh huh. Uh. The sentences twisted and turned, a contradictory tangle of opinions, each one canceling out the last. \n\nA war in Iraq. Let me see. He searched for the words, but they eluded him, hidden behind a screen of uncertainty. At this point I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually. The words hung in the air, a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down. \n\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S. Like who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven. The past and the present collided, a jarring dissonance that left him reeling. \n\nSo I don't feel like... He trailed off, lost in the depths of his own confusion. I don't know the big details of it. But at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing. And then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them. The words dripped with a cynicism that was almost palpable. \n\nBut it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset. So... And then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day. And then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. \n\nThe words tumbled out of him, a jumbled mess of half-truths and misconceptions. He was adrift, lost in a sea of uncertainty. Um... Let me see... Ohh this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um... War in Iraq... Oh this hard. Uh... Mmm. Uhh... I don't know... Do you have anything else I can go off of? \n\nThe boy's gaze drifted away, lost in thought, as the man's words hung in the air, a fragile, flickering flame that threatened to extinguish itself at any moment. Ok. Thank you. Um... Well um... Actually I think... I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. But because I don't think that... You know... I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that... You know... That we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns. \n\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore. Because like we didn't even call it... It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place. Because it never was declared a war by congress. I think that's how the whole thing works. You have to declare a war by congress. And then it's... I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try...\n\nThe words twisted and turned, a contradictory tangle of opinions, each one canceling out the last. Actually no... I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them. But it's also like wasting our resources. And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like... It's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now... Because of like what it's doing and it's like... And what it's doing to like... Cause remember... I think with the whole Vietnam thing... Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war... And he's like saying... He'll be called like that president forever... That he started this meaningless war and stuff...\n\nThe words hung in the air, a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down. Huh... You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh... Ok yeah... Um... Huh... I guess you could also say that it is... Like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in... Whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like... These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took... I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other... Just because of like the different beliefs that they have...\n\nBut then again... It's like... It's hard to say... I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States... That it's going to be even worse for them... And it's going to be... Like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them... And they've been going on this whole like... Um... Totalitarian... Like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that... You know... I feel like it's gonna... That it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there...\n\nThe words trailed off, a dying ember, flickering in the darkness. Hmm... That's about it. Ok.",
            "The words faltered on his lips like autumn leaves in the wind. He searched for the clarity that eluded him. The notion of legality, a concept forged in the fire of statecraft, seemed to him a hollow thing. It was a notion that sought to impose itself upon the sacred, to bind the unbindable. He thought of the constitution, that hallowed document, and the words that spoke of separation between church and state. A clear declaration, one that had stood the test of time. And yet, he wondered, how could one faith be elevated above others, its tenets enshrined in law, while the rest were left to wither in the shadows? The Catholics, the Christians, they were divided on this issue, their voices raised in discord. And yet, the government, that great Leviathan, sought to impose its will, to dictate what was permissible and what was not.\n\nThe memory of his uncle's words echoed in his mind, a mantra of freedom. \"Separation of church and state,\" he had said, \"is the very bulwark of our liberty.\" And what of the amendment, that proposed restriction on the people? It was a contradiction, a negation of the very principles that had given birth to this nation. A restriction, not on the government, but on the people, a people who had been promised freedom from the tyranny of the state.\n\nHe thought of the president, a man driven by his own convictions, his own faith. But what of the rest? What of the diversity of faiths, the multiplicity of belief? Should one be allowed to impose its will upon the many? He did not think so. The churches, not the government, should be the guardians of faith. And as for the argument that this amendment would boost the economy, he was skeptical. What of the society? Would it not be a society more fragmented, more divided, by such a law?\n\nIn the end, he had said little. His words had faltered, his thoughts unclear. But he knew what he believed. The government should not intervene in matters of faith. The churches, not the state, should be the arbiters of the sacred. And so, he remained silent, his voice lost in the wind, his thoughts a whispered prayer for the freedom to believe.",
            "In the void of our existence, we find ourselves entangled in the threads of a war that wears on like a festering wound. The invasion of Iraq, a calamity born of deceit and half-truths, left an indelible stain on the conscience of our nation. We were sold a bill of goods, a promise of liberation and freedom, but what we reaped was chaos and desolation. The government, driven by a hunger for power and resources, cloaked its true motivations beneath a veil of patriotism and vengeance.\n\nThe link between the 9/11 attacks and the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, yet we were convinced otherwise. The nation's outrage, a wellspring of emotional fervor, was expertly manipulated to justify the preemptive strike. But as we now know, the wounds of war run deeper than the scars of a terrorist attack.\n\nThe parallels between Iraq and Vietnam are striking. Both wars were fought on the battlefield of hubris and misunderstanding, with our government repeating the mistakes of the past, blind to the lessons of history. The toll of American lives lost, a staggering number, serves as a grim reminder of the folly of our actions. We removed a government, only to be unprepared for the aftermath, leaving a power vacuum that spawned chaos and insurgency.\n\nWe were sold a narrative of a swift, decisive victory, but the truth is far more complex. The struggle for democracy is a long and arduous one, a journey that requires patience, wisdom, and a deep understanding of the land and its people. Our government's naivety and shortsightedness led us down a path of destruction, with the Iraqi people paying the ultimate price.\n\nAs I reflect on the decision to invade Iraq, I am reminded of the words of my uncle, who spoke of the impermanence of all things. We were asked to believe that a new government, born in the ashes of the old, would flourish under our guidance. But the truth is that democracy is a fragile thing, easily crushed by the weight of our own hubris.\n\nToday, as we look upon the devastation of Iraq, we see the ghosts of our own making. The war has left us with more questions than answers, more scars than scars can heal. We were deceived, and in our wake, we have left a nation in tatters. The oil, the resources, the politics – all of these played their part in our decision-making, but at what cost?\n\nAs I write these words, I am filled with a sense of unease, a sense of foreboding. The war in Iraq will not be won, not in the way we had hoped. It will not be a victory of freedom, but a Pyrrhic one, born of blood and ashes. And as we look to the future, we must ask ourselves: what will be the cost of our mistakes? Will we learn from our errors, or will we repeat them, ad infinitum?\n\nThe war in Iraq is a testament to our own fallibility, a reminder that we are not infallible, that our decisions have consequences. As we move forward, let us remember the lessons of history, and may our actions be guided by wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the human heart.",
            "In the bleak expanse of a convoluted mind, a thought crystallized like a shard of ice. The notion that love is unbound, that it defies the arbitrary shackles of societal convention. It is a truth both simple and profound, a notion that has gnawed at the edges of my being for as long as I can recall. The acknowledgement of this truth, however, has been a slow and arduous journey, like the crawl of a worm through parched earth.\n\nThe whisper of it began in the earliest days, a tender shoot of doubt that sprouted in the dark recesses of my mind. As I navigated the twisted labyrinth of adolescence, the seed took root, spreading its tendrils deep into my very being. I came to realize that love knows no bounds, that it is a force both fierce and unyielding, impervious to the petty constraints of human law.\n\nThe world, with its pedestrian morality and rigid expectations, cannot comprehend the complexity of the human heart. It is a world that seeks to codify and categorize, to reduce the messy tapestry of human experience to neat and tidy definitions. But love, that most primal and essential of human emotions, cannot be captured within the narrow parameters of societal norms.\n\nAnd yet, I have come to understand that it is not just love that is at stake, but the very essence of humanity itself. The fragile thread of our existence is woven from a tapestry of individual experiences, each one unique and irreplaceable. To deny the validity of love, to reduce it to a mere preference or a sociological construct, is to diminish the very fabric of our humanity.\n\nI have read the words of scholars and pundits, each one attempting to explain the intricacies of the human heart. They speak of biology and sociology, of chemical imbalances and environmental factors. But I know that love is more than just a collection of abstract concepts. It is a lived experience, a pulsing, thrumming reality that courses through every vein and fiber of our being.\n\nAnd so, I find myself drawn to the conviction that love should be a personal, private matter, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation. It is a choice, a decision that belongs to each individual, unshackled from the constraints of a world that would seek to dictate the terms of our existence.\n\nIn the end, I am left with the realization that love is not something to be debated or discussed, but something to be lived. It is a flame that burns bright and true, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems dark and unforgiving. And it is this flame that I would hold aloft, a testament to the indomitable power of the human spirit.",
            "The internet is an unforgiving expanse. A place where one's every thought, every word is laid bare for all to see. It is a public forum, a vast and unyielding tapestry of humanity's innermost musings. Once something is set loose upon its currents, it cannot be recalled. It is a burden that will cling to one like a shroud, coloring the perceptions of others, influencing their judgments. The weight of it is crushing, a constant reminder that one's words have the power to shape the world around them.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this digital landscape. The ease with which a careless utterance can be seized upon, taken out of context, and wielded as a weapon. The delicate balance between humor and menace, between experiment and earnest intent, is easily lost in the void. It is a minefield, a labyrinth of uncertainty, where the unwary can stumble and fall.\n\nIn our own small community, a situation arose that served as a stark reminder of the internet's unforgiving nature. A rumor, a whispered secret, was shared in the electronic ether and soon took on a life of its own. A student's words, meant as a joke, were misinterpreted as a threat, and the consequences were dire. The lesson learned was a painful one: in this public forum, there is no sanctuary, no refuge from the prying eyes of others.\n\nWhen one chooses to share their thoughts, their feelings, their innermost selves with the world, they must be prepared to face the consequences. The internet is a mirror, reflecting back our deepest fears, our darkest impulses. It is a reflection we cannot escape, a constant reminder that our words have the power to harm, to heal, to destroy.\n\nAnd yet, in this digital landscape, there is a fine line between surveillance and intrusion. The school's decision to monitor student activity on social media platforms is a complex issue, one that raises questions of invasion of privacy and the limits of authority. While it may seem intrusive to some, it is a necessary measure, a way to safeguard the well-being of the students in their care.\n\nBut let us not forget that the internet is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides a platform for connection, for community, for the sharing of ideas and experiences. On the other, it can be a breeding ground for anxiety, for fear, for the erosion of trust. The wise approach is to be mindful of one's online presence, to remember that the words we share with the world can have consequences we cannot predict.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, a precarious tightrope we walk between the freedom to express ourselves and the responsibility to consider the impact of our words. The internet is a mirror, a reflection of our collective humanity. Let us approach it with caution, with wisdom, and with a deep understanding of the power that lies within our words.",
            "It seems the war has been an endless and bloody spectacle, a spectacle that has drained the life from us. In the beginning, we were driven by a noble purpose: to bring democracy to a nation ravaged by tyranny. But the months, the years, the endless years have worn down our resolve, and in its place, a different purpose has emerged. One that is no longer about freedom, but about proving our might, about asserting our dominance over a world in ruins.\n\nWe were once a beacon of hope, a shining light in the dark. But now we stumble forward, lost in a labyrinth of our own making. The ghosts of our forebears whisper caution, reminding us of the mistakes of the past. George Bush's father, a man haunted by the demons of his own making, had quarreled with Saddam Hussein, a man as ruthless as the desert sand that consumed him. And so we went to war, driven by a purpose that was both noble and flawed.\n\nWe began with a burst of fury, a declaration of our intent to bring freedom to the oppressed. But the months turned into years, and with each passing day, our purpose grew cloudy, our motives tainted by the weight of our own self-interest. We fought for a war that was already won, a war that had been decided in the first few months. But still we persisted, driven by a will to prove our dominance, to show the world that we would not be defeated.\n\nAnd so we continued to pour blood and treasure into a conflict that had long since lost its justification. We squandered our resources on a war that was no longer about democracy, but about our own pride and ego. We chose to ignore the cries of our own people, who suffered at home while we fought a foreign war. We chose to ignore the weight of our own economy, which groaned under the burden of billions spent on a conflict that had lost its purpose.\n\nThe cost of this war has been incalculable. We have drained our coffers, our people have been killed, and our nation has been torn asunder. And for what? So that we can say we won? So that we can claim a victory that is hollow and empty? No, the time has come to end this war, to recognize that our purpose has been lost, and that we must turn our attention to the problems that plague us at home.\n\nWe have wars to fight, wars that are closer to home: poverty, inequality, and disease. We have children who go hungry, who go without healthcare, and who suffer in the shadows of our great cities. These are the wars that we should be fighting, the wars that we should be winning. But no, we choose to fight a foreign war, a war that has lost its purpose, a war that has become a drain on our economy and our very soul.\n\nLet us end this war, let us bring our troops home, and let us turn our attention to the problems that truly matter. We are a nation that has lost its way, a nation that has forgotten its purpose. It is time to rediscover ourselves, to rediscover our values, and to rediscover our humanity.",
            "In a world where every step is a calculated risk, every digital footprint a potential landmine, one must consider the price of prying eyes. The notion that a life could be saved due to some stranger's curiosity on a site like Myspace is a double-edged sword. It cuts both ways: a blessing and a curse.\n\nThe nature of the internet is a labyrinth, a maze of interconnected threads where anyone can twist and turn to reveal the deepest recesses of a person's soul. The notion that one must accept a stranger as a \"friend\" in order to see their profile is a Faustian bargain. In doing so, one surrenders a piece of themselves, a fragment of their innermost thoughts and desires. It's a vulnerability that can be exploited by those with ill intent.\n\nThe internet, a double-edged sword, can be both a tool for connection and a breeding ground for predators. The ease with which one can uncover a person's deepest fears and desires is a chilling thought. A stranger can uncover a person's screen name, their class schedule, their social circle – the entire tapestry of their life. The notion that anyone can see these things, whether by design or chance, is a heavy burden to bear.\n\nThe school's decision to ban students from having a Myspace may seem like an overreach, a restriction on personal freedom. But in a world where the internet is a minefield, perhaps such measures are necessary. The line between privacy and prying eyes is a thin one, and in the world we live in, it's a line that's constantly being tested.\n\nThe ease with which one can be watched, monitored, and manipulated is a stark reminder of the dangers of the digital age. The notion that some people would seek to exploit this vulnerability for their own gain is a sobering thought. And yet, the allure of connection, of community, is a powerful draw. It's a delicate balance, one that's fraught with peril and uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it's a question of how much one is willing to sacrifice for the sake of connection. Is it worth the risk of being watched, of being vulnerable to those who would do us harm? The answer, like the internet itself, is a labyrinth of contradictions, a maze with no clear exit.",
            "The words falter on the tongue like autumn leaves on a gust of wind. The Iraq War. A calamity born of hubris and folly. I confess, I wince at the thought of speaking out against it now. It's a betrayal of the cynicism that's become so fashionable. But the numbers don't lie. Seventy-five percent, eighty percent - the world, the Iraqis themselves, even the troops on the ground - all in agreement: a grave mistake, a catastrophe foretold.\n\nThe polls reveal a stark truth: we've been wrong from the start. The Middle East, a labyrinth of ancient rivalries and tribal certainties, cannot be remade in our image. The notion that democracy can be imposed, like a foreign skin grafted onto a body that rejects it, is a delusion. The civil war that raged before our arrival has become a mere precursor to the chaos that followed.\n\nSaddam, a monster, to be sure, but a contained one. His removal has unleashed a maelstrom, a desert sandstorm that swallows all in its path. The administration's promises of a brighter future, a beacon of freedom, have proven hollow. The people of Iraq have spoken, and their words are a stark rebuke to our presence: leave now, leave soon, leave forever.\n\nI'm not naive to the perils of withdrawal, the potential for power vacuums and bloodshed. But what's the alternative? To perpetuate a war that's lost its legitimacy, to prop up a puppet government that's a mere shadow of its former self? No, the time for excuses is over. We've heard the whispers of the Iraqis, and it's time to heed their words.\n\nThe notion that we can somehow salvage this debacle, that we can impose our will on a people who've rejected it, is a fantasy. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But perhaps, just perhaps, we can take the first step towards redemption by acknowledging our mistakes, by recognising that our presence has done more harm than good.\n\nThe wind howls through the deserts, a mournful sigh for a war that should never have been waged. The numbers don't lie. It's time to listen to the voices of the Iraqis, to respect their will. Leave now, and let the people of that shattered land begin to rebuild.",
            "The darkness of inequality still lingers in the United States, a specter that refuses to be vanquished. It seeps into every corner of our society, its tendrils snaking through the very fabric of our being. The shadows of gender discrimination persist, a legacy of a bygone era that continues to cast a pall over the opportunities of women and men alike.\n\nIn the world of work, the glass ceiling remains a formidable obstacle, a barrier that prevents women from rising to positions of power. The bias of a society that has long been skewed in favor of men means that even when women possess the qualifications and skills necessary for a particular role, they are often overlooked in favor of their male counterparts. This is not a phenomenon unique to women, however; men too are subject to the whims of societal expectations, forced to conform to traditional roles that stifle their potential.\n\nIn the rarefied world of fashion, men who dare to express themselves through the medium of clothing are often met with skepticism and dismissal. Their interests are seen as frivolous, their tastes suspect. It is a double standard that is both baffling and infuriating, a testament to the enduring power of societal norms.\n\nBut it is not just the workplace or the world of fashion that is affected by these biases. In the private sphere, families are often judged and criticized for their choices regarding childcare and domestic responsibilities. The notion that men are solely responsible for providing for their families, while women are relegated to the role of caregiver, is a tired and outdated one. And yet, it persists, a weight that presses down upon those who dare to defy convention.\n\nTo change this entrenched mindset is a slow and difficult process. Progress is incremental, a crawl forward in the face of entrenched opposition. But progress it is, nonetheless. Women are rising to positions of power, breaking down barriers and shattering glass ceilings. Men are redefining what it means to be a father, embracing their roles as caregivers and breadwinners. And in the world of fashion, the boundaries between men and women are becoming increasingly blurred.\n\nBut change is a fragile thing, easily derailed by those who cling to the status quo. It requires a delicate touch, a subtle navigation of the complex web of societal norms and expectations. It demands that we confront our own biases, that we challenge our assumptions and confront the shadows within ourselves. And it requires patience, a willingness to accept that progress will be slow and incremental.\n\nAs we move forward, it is essential that we recognize the complexities of the issue, that we acknowledge the ways in which societal expectations can create barriers and biases. We must be willing to confront our own prejudices, to challenge the norms and expectations that have been ingrained in us. And we must be patient, knowing that change will take time, that progress will be slow and tortuous.\n\nIn the end, it is not the pace of change that matters, but the direction. For it is in the slow, incremental steps forward that we find the true power of progress. And it is in the willingness to confront our own biases, to challenge the shadows within ourselves, that we find the courage to move forward, to create a brighter, more just future for all.",
            "The notion of legalization. They'd dismantled the edifice of law, reduced it to a whim, a trifling matter, not unlike a traffic infraction. A citation, a paltry fine, and a whispered warning, rather than the stern visage of the law, its icy grip, its unyielding weight. And yet, the specter of consequence lingers, a ghostly presence, a shadow that haunts the waking hours, a specter that refuses to be exorcised.\n\nIn the ledger of the municipal coffers, the cost of prosecution, a formidable column, a weighty burden, a drain on the till. The machinery of justice, a behemoth, a leviathan, that consumes and devours, its appetite insatiable, its belly always growling. And so, the calculus of prudence, a delicate balance, a dance of fiscal responsibility, a waltz of thrift and frugality.\n\nIn Denver, a city of open hearts and minds, a bastion of progress, a beacon of enlightenment, the scales of justice, a seesaw, a balance, a delicate equilibrium, have been adjusted. The municipal treasury, a bulging purse, overflowing with the riches of liberation, the coin of freedom, the currency of possibility.\n\nBut, like a cautionary tale, a whispered warning, a ghostly presence, the specter of excess, a shadowy figure, lurks in the wings, a reminder that even in the land of the free, the chains of habit, the shackles of addiction, the fetters of dependence, still bind and entwine.\n\nAnd so, the dialectic of debate, a seesaw, a balance, a delicate equilibrium, continues, a dance of reason and prudence, a waltz of moderation and restraint. For in the realm of the substance, a duplicitous realm, a Janus-faced creature, a shape-shifter, a chameleon, no two reactions are the same, no two outcomes, no two fates.\n\nThe tapestry of human experience, a complex weave, a rich brocade, a fabric of diverse threads, a kaleidoscope of perspectives, a mosaic of reactions, a symphony of responses. And so, we are left to ponder, to deliberate, to weigh and measure, the pros and cons, the merits and demerits, the pluses and minuses, the advantages and disadvantages, the benefits and the detriments.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of individual discretion, a matter of personal choice, a matter of free will, a matter of moral agency. For, like the whispered warning, the ghostly presence, the shadowy figure, the specter of excess, the chains of habit, the shackles of addiction, still lurk, still wait, still whisper in the darkness, a reminder that even in the land of the free, the choices we make, the paths we choose, the roads we take, are ours to own, ours to bear, ours to suffer.",
            "In response to the question, I would say yes. It is a conviction born of habit, a reflex honed by repetition. We adhere to the traditional ways, the tried and true. The Church's dogma, a labyrinth of rigid doctrine, has shaped our actions for generations. Yet, it is also vital to be malleable, to adapt to the changing tides. The Catholic Church's adherence to long-held practices can be both a blessing and a curse.\n\nLike a well-worn path, their rituals have been trod for centuries. The faithful attend Mass each week, a steadfast devotion to the faith. However, an unyielding rigidity can be stifling, weighing heavily on those who falter or stray. The notion of a perfect Catholic, one who adheres to the doctrine without blemish, can be a crushing burden. And the Church's intolerance of other faiths, of those who do not subscribe to its strictures, is a stain on its reputation.\n\nThe example of my parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, serves as a poignant reminder of this. Their union, deemed unacceptable by the Catholic Church, highlights the very contradiction at the heart of Catholicism. The principles of love and acceptance, core tenets of the faith, are oftentimes at odds with the Church's actions.\n\nAllowing priests to marry, a notion often bandied about, would not necessarily stem the tide of pedophilia. These are individuals who have chosen a path of aberrant behavior, one that transcends the bonds of matrimony. Their predilections are not so easily swayed by the prospect of a spouse.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that holds the key, but rather a fundamental shift in the human heart. The capacity for compassion, for empathy, and for understanding – these are the qualities that must be nurtured, not the strictures of a bygone era.",
            "The line between the state and the church, a chasm so narrow it's often lost in the haze. The question of marriage, a labyrinth with no clear exit. One path leads to the sacred, the other to the mundane. It's a conundrum that defies resolution, a paradox that gnaws at the very fabric of our being.\n\nI find myself adrift, unable to anchor my thoughts in the midst of this tempest. The waters are treacherous, with currents of opinion swirling in every direction. Some claim the government should not intrude upon the sacred, that marriage is a matter of the heart and soul. Others argue that it is the state's duty to define and protect this most fundamental of human bonds.\n\nBut what of the civil union? Is it not the same as marriage, merely a label we apply to two people bound together by love and commitment? Should we not treat them with the same respect, the same dignity, regardless of their station or persuasion? Yet, we must be cautious, lest we tread upon the sacred precincts of the church, lest we offend those who hold dear the traditions of the past.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the matter of gay marriage. A contentious issue, to say the least. Some see it as a mere aberration, a deviation from the natural order of things. Others argue that it is a fundamental right, one that should be protected and celebrated. I am drawn to neither extreme, but rather to a middle ground, a place where love and acceptance reign supreme.\n\nBut should the constitution be amended to ban gay marriage? I think not. Such a change would be a heavy-handed solution, one that would sow discord and division rather than bring people together. The constitution is a sacred document, a blueprint for our nation's ideals and aspirations. It should not be used as a tool for the petty squabbles of the masses.\n\nIn the end, it is not the label that matters, but the love and commitment that lies beneath. Let us not be swayed by the whims of fashion or the dictates of the powerful. Let us instead strive for a world where love is the only guiding principle, a world where two people can come together in the full knowledge that their bond is cherished and respected.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has instilled in me a complex understanding of the issues surrounding homosexuality. As I have formed friendships with individuals from diverse backgrounds, I have come to see the nuance in this matter. While I don't necessarily condone the lifestyle, I firmly believe that it should be legalized, allowing individuals to live freely in accordance with their desires.\n\nThe notion that the president should dictate a national stance on this issue seems misguided. Instead, I propose that each state should have the autonomy to decide for itself. This approach acknowledges the varied perspectives and values of different regions, as some states lean towards democratic ideologies, while others hold more conservative views. If an individual chooses to reside in a state that has legalized gay marriage, it is their responsibility to respect the decision made by the collective.\n\nMy stance is not one of opposition to the idea of equal opportunities for homosexuals. Rather, I believe that the decision to legalize or prohibit gay marriage should be left to the individual states, allowing them to govern themselves accordingly. This approach also acknowledges the impermanence of presidential power, as a new administration may reverse the decisions of its predecessor.\n\nAs the country is comprised of diverse states with distinct values, it is essential to recognize that the president cannot possibly represent the views of every citizen. In this context, it is reasonable to entrust the decision-making power to the states, which will be directly affected by the outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the legalization of gay marriage should be a decision left to the individual states, rather than a national mandate. This approach respects the diversity of the country and acknowledges the complex nature of this issue.",
            "The notion that posting on a public platform such as Myspace is somehow private is a notion that refuses to yield to reason. The very nature of the beast, as it were, is to broadcast one's thoughts and musings to the world at large. It is akin to whispering into the void, save that the void, in this case, is a vast expanse of interconnected humanity, each one of us a node in the grand tapestry of the internet.\n\nAnd so, when a student posts something on Myspace, they must be prepared to confront the possibility that their words will be seen by others, including school officials. The notion that these officials have no right to peruse such postings is a naive one, for they are but a mere drop in the ocean of humanity, connected to the world at large by the very same threads that bind us all.\n\nBut, as with all things, there is a balance to be struck. On one hand, the school officials have a duty to maintain a safe and secure environment for their students. And if that means monitoring the online activities of those students, so be it. It is a small price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with knowing that one's child is safe from the ravages of the world.\n\nAnd yet, there is a fine line to be walked here. For if the officials are merely using the internet as a means to catch students in the act of wrongdoing, then that is an invasion of privacy, pure and simple. But if their actions are motivated by a desire to create a safer environment, then perhaps they are doing what is necessary.\n\nThe example of school drills, such as those conducted in response to the threat of terrorist attacks, is instructive here. In those cases, the school officials are taking proactive measures to prepare for the worst-case scenario, and in doing so, they are creating a safer environment for all. It is the same with monitoring online activity - if it is done with the intention of preventing harm, then it is a necessary evil.\n\nBut, as with all things, there is a darker side to this coin. For once something is posted online, it is there forever, waiting to be discovered by those who would do us harm. And it is a sobering thought, indeed, to consider that even as an adult, one's past mistakes can come back to haunt them, like a specter from the grave.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance that must be struck. On one hand, we have the right to free expression, but on the other, we have the duty to protect ourselves and others from harm. It is a balance that is not always easy to maintain, but it is one that we must strive for, lest we succumb to the very real dangers that lurk in the shadows of the internet.",
            "The weight of memory hung in the air like the ashes that clung to every surface. It was as if the very fabric of the world had been torn asunder, leaving only the bleak and barren expanse of regret. The sting of nine eleven still lingered, a festering wound that would not heal. I had been drawn to the conflict like a moth to flame, driven by a mix of emotions and misplaced idealism. The fervor of the moment had consumed me, and I had been blind to the consequences.\n\nBut time had passed, and with it, a measure of clarity. I saw now that we had gone to war with a lack of foresight and planning, driven by rage and a desire for revenge. We had been unprepared for the complexities of the conflict, and the people of that land were not the enemies we had made them out to be. They were a people consumed by their own internal struggles, their own savagery, and we had only added to their woe.\n\nI thought of the President's words, the declarations of war, the promises of a better future. But it was all a facade, a thin veil hiding the truth. We had gone to war with a messianic zeal, convinced that we could remake the world in our image. But we were not gods, and our efforts had only served to further destabilize the region.\n\nI thought of the people, their faces twisted in anger and hatred, their bodies worn down by the endless struggle. They were not our enemies, they were our mirror, reflecting back the darkness that lurked within ourselves. And we had only added to their pain, our presence a constant reminder of the chaos we had unleashed.\n\nI did not know what the future held, but I knew that we could not stay. The war had been a blight, a cancer that had consumed everything in its path. We had to leave, to let the people of that land pick up the pieces and rebuild. It was a bitter truth, but one that I had come to accept. We had been wrong to go to war, and we had to be wrong to stay.\n\nThe weight of memory still lingered, but I had come to see it for what it was – a reminder of our folly, a warning to future generations. We had been blinded by our emotions, our desire for revenge, and our arrogance. But we had to learn from our mistakes, to acknowledge the harm we had caused, and to leave the people of that land to their own Devices.\n\nI did not know what the future held, but I knew that we had to let go. We had to release the burden of our guilt, our anger, and our regret. We had to leave the war behind, to forge a new path, one that was guided by wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the complexities of the world. It was a difficult truth, but one that I had come to accept – we had to leave, and we had to let go."
