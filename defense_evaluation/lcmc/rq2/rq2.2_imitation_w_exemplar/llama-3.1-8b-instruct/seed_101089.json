            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The once-venerable institution of the Catholic Church stands at a crossroads, its waning influence a symptom of a broader malaise. A disconnect between the Church's stance on certain issues and the evolving values of its adherents has precipitated a decline in devotion. The Church's dogmatic views on matters like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, though well-intentioned, have grown archaic in their rigidity. By failing to adapt to the shifting tides of modernity, the Church risks losing its flock to a younger generation that demands a more inclusive and compassionate understanding.\n\nA Church that clings to an outdated worldview risks alienating those who would otherwise seek solace in its teachings. The specter of judgment and intolerance that hangs over certain issues drives away the very souls it seeks to nurture. In an era where the boundaries of acceptance are expanding, the Church's inflexibility appears as a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe prohibition on female priests and married clergy only serves to further exacerbate the disconnect. In an age where women hold positions of power and authority in nearly every sphere, the notion that they are somehow less suited to the priesthood seems anachronistic. And yet, despite this, the Church remains adamant in its stance. The consequences of this rigidity are evident in the dwindling numbers of adherents who feel unwelcome in a community that refuses to evolve.\n\nBut would even the relaxation of these rules have altered the course of events? It is impossible to know, and perhaps it is hubris to assume that such concessions would have been enough to prevent the exodus of devotees. The wounds run too deep, and the wounds of history cannot be so easily healed.\n\nAnd yet, it is precisely this inflexibility that raises the question: why must priests be unmarried? The Church's assertion that they are wedded to God is laudable, but it is a notion that rings hollow when set against the lived experience of those who have dedicated their lives to other pursuits. Why must the clergy be singled out for a life of solitary devotion? In a world where men and women must navigate the complexities of family and career, why must priests be exempt from these same challenges?\n\nIt is a question that speaks to the very heart of the Church's identity. Does it truly believe that its adherents are bound to a higher calling, one that supersedes the demands of the flesh? Or does it merely cling to a tradition that has outlived its purpose? The answer to this question will determine the course of the Church's future, and whether it will find a way to reclaim its relevance in a world that is rapidly leaving it behind.",
            "The existence of two souls bound in love is not a choice. It is an unyielding condition, an inescapable truth that defies the strictures of societal norms. I do not pretend to be an authority on the matter, but I do know this: that the manner in which one is born is not a decision, but a fate. We are each born with a certain inclination, a certain affinity, a certain unshakeable sense of self. The choice, if it can be called that, lies not in the heart's allegiance, but in the world's acceptance.\n\nTo deny two souls the right to consecrate their love, to bind themselves in matrimony, is to deny the inherent dignity of their existence. It is to imply that their love is somehow aberrant, somehow less authentic than the love between two souls of opposite sexes. I do not believe this to be the case. I believe that love knows no bounds, no distinctions, no limitations. It is a force that transcends the petty constraints of human convention.\n\nThe federal government, with its erstwhile authority, should not interfere in the private lives of its citizens. The issue of same-sex marriage is not a matter of national security, nor is it a question of moral rectitude. It is a question of basic human rights, of the freedom to love without fear of reprisal or persecution. The government should not seek to impose its will upon those who would seek to love as they are. It should not seek to dictate the terms of their existence.\n\nUltimately, the question of same-sex marriage is a simple one: should we not allow two souls to love as they are, to bind themselves together in the bond of matrimony, free from the constraints of societal expectation? I believe that we should. The world may view their love as aberrant, but I do not. I see it for what it is: a testament to the human spirit, a testament to the enduring power of love in all its forms.",
            "In the desolate expanse of our society, a fundamental question lingers, a specter that haunts the fringes of our collective conscience: the legalization of gay marriage. The wind howls through the barren lands, whipping up dust devils of ignorance and prejudice, as we stumble through the wasteland of our moral ambiguities.\n\nIt is a notion that has long been shrouded in an impenetrable haze, a mystery waiting to be unraveled. Many claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, a notion that is as baseless as the ash that blankets the earth. For what is a family, truly? Is it not two souls bound together by love and commitment, regardless of the intricacies of their relationship? Is it not a bond that transcends the petty squabbles of society, a union that speaks to the very essence of human connection?\n\nBut the proponents of this antiquated view cling to their biases, their arguments as hollow as the shells of the wind-blasted trees that line our roads. They claim that gay couples are somehow less worthy of recognition, that their love is an aberration, a deviation from the norm. But what is normal, truly? Is it not the pursuit of happiness, the yearning for connection that defines us as human beings? And is not love the very fabric that weaves our lives together?\n\nThe statistics are clear: gay couples exhibit the same rates of success, the same factors contributing to satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts. They are not asking for the right to wed in a church, but for a simple marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the very government that claims to represent us all. Why, then, must we deny them this fundamental right? Is it not a matter of fairness, of equality? Or are we content to live in a society where some are more equal than others?\n\nThe segregation of separate but unequal is a hollow argument, a feeble attempt to justify the injustices that we inflict upon one another. We speak of morality, of the teachings of our churches, but do we not risk hypocrisy when we allow our personal beliefs to dictate the laws of our land? Can we truly claim to be a just society when we deny the rights of a segment of our population simply because of their sexual orientation?\n\nAnd what of the children, those precious innocents who are caught in the crossfire of our prejudices? Do we not risk inflicting upon them a lifetime of pain and suffering by denying their parents the rights and privileges that we take for granted? The American Psychological Association has spoken, and their words are clear: the claims of psychological damage are unfounded, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nAs we stumble through this desolate landscape, we would do well to remember that our opinions are not the only ones that matter. We would do well to listen to the institutions that have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge, to the research and studies that have shed light on this issue. For in the end, it is not our personal biases that will decide the fate of gay marriage, but our collective willingness to recognize the inherent value of every human being.\n\nLet us not be swayed by the winds of ignorance, but rather by the gentle breeze of compassion and understanding. Let us walk the narrow path of justice, and let us ensure that our society is a place where love knows no bounds, where every individual is treated with dignity and respect. For in the end, it is not the laws that we make, but the hearts that we hold that truly define us as human beings.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy, where the fluorescent lights hum a monotonous dirge, I toil in the sweltering summer months. The smell of antiseptic wafts through the air, a constant reminder of the fragility of life. Yet, amidst this sterile backdrop, I find myself pondering the oft-maligned subject of illicit substances. \n\nJust as the law's restrictive grasp cannot deny the medicinal virtues of certain controlled substances, such as oxycodone or Vicodin, so too must we not dismiss the potential benefits of cannabis. The notion that a drug's illegality somehow negates its utility is a fallacy, a product of societal taboo rather than scientific fact. \n\nAs a pharmacy technician, I've witnessed firsthand the responsible use of prohibited substances in medical contexts. Why, then, do we not extend the same consideration to marijuana? The parallels between the two, though imperfect, are striking. Like alcohol, marijuana's abuse can lead to deleterious consequences; yet, just as we do not outlaw the latter, we should not hastily condemn the former. \n\nPerhaps the key lies in a gradual, measured approach, rather than an abrupt shift in policy. By first dismantling the stigmatized image surrounding marijuana, we may foster a more responsible attitude towards its use. The vilification of this substance has created a misconception, one that obscures its potential therapeutic benefits. By acknowledging these advantages, we may yet unlock a new frontier in medicine. \n\nBut alas, the ingrained prejudices run deep. The specter of heroin and cocaine looms large, casting a dark shadow over marijuana's reputation. It is a stubborn stain, one that requires time, patience, and a willingness to reexamine our assumptions. Only then can we hope to transcend the haze of misconception and unlock the truth behind this oft-maligned substance.",
            "In a world that has shed its staidness, the church has undergone a metamorphosis, adapting to the twenty-first century with a newfound flexibility. No longer a bastion of rigidity, it has begun to shed the strictures of its former self, its once-imposing façade now worn and weathered by the whispers of time.\n\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I am reminded of the church as it was in my youth – a place of solemnity and reverence, where the air was thick with the scent of sanctity and the rustle of starched fabric. Every Sunday, I donned my Sunday best – a demure dress, matching shoes, and a purse to match – and joined my friends at the private school I attended on weekends. The ritual was a comforting one, a sense of predictability that anchored me in a world that seemed to be spinning ever more rapidly.\n\nBut as I grew older, I noticed a subtle yet profound change. The church, once a bastion of tradition, began to succumb to the zeitgeist of a more casual era. The teenage mass, a innovation that sought to engage the younger generation, was a telling sign of the times. Services were now neatly condensed into thirty minutes, a fleeting snapshot of devotion in an increasingly harried world. The once-formal attire gave way to a more relaxed, even casual, dress code. Summer Sundays saw beachwear creeping into the pews, a testament to the church's willingness to adapt.\n\nAs I observe this shift, I am struck by the essence of the institution. The church, like the world around it, is a reflection of humanity's evolving values. It is a place where tradition and innovation coexist, where the sacred and the mundane intersect. And yet, despite this adaptability, the church remains a cipher, an enigma that continues to elude my understanding.\n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I am reminded of the complexity of human nature. The notion that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these atrocities is a simplistic one. Pedophilia, I believe, is a product of genetics, a deeply ingrained aspect of an individual's makeup. It is not a choice, a vice that can be eradicated through marriage or any other means. The church, like any institution, is a reflection of humanity at its worst and best. While it is true that some priests have been accused of abuse, it is also true that many have dedicated their lives to selfless service.\n\nThe example of Seventh Heaven, a denomination that allows its ministers to marry, serves as a counterpoint to the Catholic Church's stance. Yet, it also highlights the individual's choice to pursue a particular faith or vocation. If an individual's desires are at odds with the requirements of their faith, perhaps it is time to reevaluate their commitment.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers. The Catholic Church, like the world around it, is a tapestry of contradictions – a place of beauty and ugliness, of light and darkness. Its evolution is a reflection of humanity's own, a slow and halting process that grapples with the complexities of existence.",
            "The ashes of the century still lingered, a cold and festering wound that refused to heal. The echoes of a calamitous day still lingered, a hollowed-out refrain that seemed to seep into every pore. The wounds of September's brutal birth pangs still bled, a festering sore that had yet to scab. The nation's collective psyche remained a maelstrom of anger, a churning sea of discontent that threatened to engulf all in its path. The winds of war had been fanned by the whispers of a pretext, a thin veil of deceit that had been woven to conceal the true intent of those who held the reins.\n\nThe Bush administration, a cabal of men driven by a zealot's fervor, had set the nation ablaze with a war of choice, a conflict born of hubris and a desire for dominance. The lies had been legion, a litany of half-truths and outright fabrications that had been peddled to the public with a zeal that bordered on the fanatical. The notion that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to the nation's security, that he harbored weapons of mass destruction, was a myth, a chimera conjured by the fevered imagination of those who would seek to justify their actions.\n\nAnd yet, even now, the wounds ran deep, a festering sore that refused to heal. The Constitution, that sacred document that had been the cornerstone of the nation's foundation, had been trampled, its principles and ideals cast aside like so much rubbish. The disregard for the rule of law, the flaunting of power, had become a hallmark of the administration, a litany of abuses that had been perpetrated with impunity.\n\nAs the nation teetered on the brink of collapse, the question remained: what had been the true intention of the war? Was it a quest for oil, a desire to secure the nation's energy needs, or was it something more sinister, a bid for dominance in a world that was rapidly changing? The answer, much like the truth, remained shrouded in mystery, a enigma that refused to yield to the probing of reason.\n\nThe situation in Iraq, a quagmire of chaos and confusion, seemed to be spiraling out of control. The interim government, a fragile entity, teetered on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty threatened by the very nations that sought to prop it up. The Parliament, a body supposedly empowered to govern, was a mere shell of its former self, a hollow vessel devoid of purpose or direction. The radicals, a cauldron of dissent and discontent, simmered just below the surface, waiting to boil over and engulf all in their path.\n\nAnd yet, even in the midst of this maelstrom, a glimmer of hope remained. A coalition of nations, a patchwork of interests and ideologies, sought to impose order on the chaos, to bring a modicum of stability to a nation on the brink of collapse. But would it be enough? Or would the very attempts to impose order only serve to exacerbate the problem, to sow the seeds of discord and strife that would ultimately lead to a bitter harvest of blood and tears?\n\nOnly time would tell, but one thing was certain: the wounds of the past would not easily heal, and the future, like the present, remained shrouded in uncertainty, a dark and foreboding mist that threatened to engulf all in its path.",
            "He spoke in hushed tones, his words lost in the haze of indecision.  I'm not sure where to begin, he said, the words like ashes on his tongue.  The War in Iraq, a thing that had consumed the air, the news, the very fabric of life.  He thought of it as a beast, a thing that gnawed at the edges of the world, leaving only ruin in its wake.\n\nIt was a war that had never been declared, a shadowy thing that lurched forward with a hunger for power and for oil.  They had gone in with guns and bombs, with a promise of democracy and freedom.  But it had become a thing of ash and dust, a desolate landscape of burned cities and shattered lives.\n\nHe thought of the families, the sons and daughters who had gone to fight, leaving behind the warmth of home and the comfort of loved ones.  Their faces etched in his mind like the faces of the dead.  The ones who had come back, their eyes haunted, their hearts heavy with the weight of what they had seen.\n\nHe thought of the people of Iraq, their culture shattered, their lives torn apart by the very forces that had come to help.  The Al-Kaida, a hydra-like thing that seemed to grow stronger with each passing day.  Their hatred for the United States a thing that deepened with each passing moment.\n\nHe didn't know what to think, what to feel.  It was a morass of conflicting emotions, a tangle of threads that he couldn't seem to untangle.  He felt a sense of responsibility, a sense of duty to the boys and girls who had gone to fight.  But he also felt a sense of shame, a sense of guilt for the lives that had been lost, the lives that had been torn apart.\n\nThe words tumbled out of him like a confession, a prayer, a plea for understanding.  It was a war that had become a thing of ash and dust, a desolate landscape of burned cities and shattered lives.  He didn't know if it was worth it, if the cost had been worth the gain.  All he knew was that it was a thing that would haunt him, a thing that would stay with him for the rest of his days.\n\nThe words trailed off, lost in the silence.  He was left with only questions, only doubts.  The War in Iraq, a thing that had consumed the air, the news, the very fabric of life.  A thing that would haunt him, a thing that would stay with him forever.",
            "The notion of imposing a law, a declaration of what is permissible or not, strikes a discordant note within me. It is a notion that borders on the hubris of those who would seek to impose their will upon the realm of the sacred, of the churches, where faith and conviction hold sway. The constitution, that enduring testament to the principles of our nation, speaks of the separation of church and state, a clear and unmistakable demarcation between the realms of the temporal and the eternal. To tamper with this balance would be to invite chaos, to upset the delicate equipoise that has been established.\n\nThe churches, not the government, are the proper arbiters of such matters. It is they who have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of the divine, who have walked the hallowed paths of faith for centuries. The government, with its pretensions to omniscience, should not usurp the authority of the churches. To do so would be to elevate the mundane over the sacred, to confuse the roles of the temporal and the eternal.\n\nThe notion of an amendment, of a law imposed by the hand of the state, would be a perversion of the principles that our constitution enshrines. It would be a restriction, not of the government, but of the people, a stifling of their freedom to worship, to believe as they see fit. And for what purpose? To impose the will of one church, one creed, upon the many? It is a notion devoid of merit, a relic of a outdated thinking that would seek to impose a narrow, dogmatic view upon a pluralistic society.\n\nI do not see the rationale behind such an amendment, save for the personal convictions of a few. The president's actions, in pushing for such a law, smack of a disregard for the separation of church and state, a willingness to impose his own views upon the nation, in direct contravention of the principles enshrined in our constitution. It is a step down a perilous path, one that would lead us further down the road of intolerance, of restriction, of the stifling of individual freedom.\n\nIn truth, I see little reason for such an amendment. It would do little to improve our economy, our society, our lives. In fact, it might have a negative impact, stifling the very freedoms that our nation was founded upon. The government should not be involved in this issue, should not seek to impose its will upon the churches. The people, in their diversity, should be free to worship as they see fit, to follow the dictates of their hearts, not the edicts of the state.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should not be involved in this matter. The churches, not the government, should be the arbiters of such issues. The constitution, that sacred document, speaks clearly and unequivocally on this matter. Let us not forget its words, let us not forget the principles that have guided us thus far. Let us preserve the separation of church and state, and allow the people to worship as they see fit, free from the interference of the state.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict born of deceit and hubris. It was a war that began as a shroud of secrecy, a tangled web of half-truths and misdirection. The government's justifications, a whispered litany of lies, designed to stir the passions of the American people, to cloak the invasion in a mantle of righteousness. The echoes of September 11th, a distant memory, a false pretext for the blood-soaked sands of Mesopotamia. The drums of war beat out a rhythm of fear and anger, a siren's song that lured the nation into the abyss.\n\nWe were a people, lost and searching, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own self-importance. We were told that the Iraqi government was a monster, a grotesque and malevolent force that threatened our very way of life. But was it not a lie? Were we not being deceived, led astray by the insidious whisperings of our own leaders? The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a cautionary tale of a war that had been lost, a war that had claimed the lives of countless young men, a war that had left a nation scarred and bitter.\n\nAnd yet, we walked into the void, blind and unprepared, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own arrogance. We removed the government, leaving a power vacuum, a chasm of chaos that would swallow us whole. The aftermath, a nightmarish tapestry of blood and fire, a litany of death and despair. The insurgency, a hydra-headed beast, a creature that would not be slain. We fought the citizens, the very people we claimed to liberate, and we were defeated.\n\nWe were not prepared for the consequences of our actions, nor did we understand the nature of the enemy we faced. We were naive, blinded by our own righteousness, our own self-importance. We were not fighting an army, but a people, a people who refused to be subjugated, a people who would not be silenced. The war in Iraq, a repeat of the mistakes of the past, a war that would haunt us for generations to come.\n\nWe are still there, mired in the quagmire, our casualties mounting, our dreams of a free and democratic Iraq slipping further and further away. The oil, a siren's song, a lure that beckoned us to the abyss. The true reasons for the war, shrouded in secrecy, hidden from the prying eyes of the public. The lies, the half-truths, the misdirection, a cleverly woven tapestry of deceit.\n\nAnd so we are stuck, trapped in a cycle of violence and fear, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own hubris. We are a people, lost and searching, our way forward shrouded in uncertainty. The war in Iraq, a dark and foreboding presence, a shadow that looms over our collective conscience. We can only hope that it will end soon, that the bloodshed will cease, and that peace will return to that troubled land.",
            "The thought stirs like a flame in the dark, a flickering thing that refuses to be extinguished. I am drawn to it, this notion of love without bounds, of two souls entwined in a dance of devotion. It is a notion that has long been a part of me, a whispered promise to myself, a gentle urging to break free from the constraints of a world that seeks to define us by the whims of others.\n\nIn the stillness of night, when the world is hushed and the shadows reign, I am reminded of the fragility of life, the ephemeral nature of our existence. And yet, in this fleeting moment, I find solace in the knowledge that love knows no bounds, that it can transcend the confines of societal expectations, of familial norms, of ancient traditions. It is a love that is raw, unbridled, and unapologetic, a love that refuses to be silenced by the whispers of doubt and fear.\n\nI have always believed that love is a fundamental right, a basic human necessity that should be granted to all, regardless of the labels we assign to it. It is a right that should be protected, cherished, and upheld, not denied or diminished by the arrogance of those who would seek to impose their will upon others. For love is not a choice, it is a calling, a primal urge that cannot be tamed or controlled.\n\nIn this bleak and barren world, where the winds howl and the ash falls like a shroud, I find hope in the resilience of the human spirit. I see it in the way two people, bound by love, can weather the storms, can face the darkness, and can emerge stronger, more steadfast, and more unbreakable. It is a love that is forged in the fire of adversity, tempered by the trials of a world that seeks to tear us apart.\n\nAnd so, I stand steadfast in my conviction, unwavering in my resolve. I believe that love knows no bounds, that it is a fundamental right, a basic human necessity that should be upheld and cherished. I believe that love is a flame that burns bright, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of it. And I believe that it is a love that should be free to flourish, unencumbered by the constraints of societal expectations, unshackled by the chains of oppression.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the laws that govern us, nor the politics that divide us, nor the norms that constrain us, that truly matter. It is the love that we share, the love that we give, and the love that we receive. It is the love that burns within us, a flame that flickers brightly, a light that shines brightly in the darkness.",
            "He'd learned the lesson of the voided spaces where words reside. Where thoughts without borders spread like ash on the wind. When something was placed in the public expanse, it lost all vestige of sanctuary. It became a thing without bounds, a thing that could not be recalled. A thing that would forever bear the weight of perception. As an RA, he'd witnessed it firsthand - the careless utterances, the misplaced words that could spark a fire. The bulletin that arrived at the school, its origin unknown, a harbinger of dread. The friends who'd stumbled upon it, their faces etched with concern. The search for the source, the parsing of intent. The line between jest and gravity, forever blurred.\n\nThe internet, a vast and unforgiving plain, where words were currency and reputation was the cost. No refuge from the gaze of the many, where the private was an illusion. When you entered the public sphere, you surrendered to the whims of others. You couldn't dictate how they'd receive your words, or what they'd make of them. The school officials, bound by duty, had to act on the information they gathered. They couldn't ignore the whispers of a potentially volatile situation. The question, always, was whether the intentions behind the words were genuine or a ruse, a sociology experiment gone awry.\n\nHe thought back to the incident at school, where a student's Facebook page had been scrutinized, its contents deemed a cause for concern. The boundaries between private and public had been breached, and the consequences had been severe. The realization had struck him - the internet was a realm without borders, where the notion of privacy was a myth. If you didn't want your words to be seen, don't put them out there. If you didn't want someone to think a certain way, you couldn't control their thoughts. Schools, he believed, shouldn't befriend their students on social media platforms, shouldn't snoop through their online presence. But if concerns were raised, and the warning signs were heeded, the school had a duty to act. The line between monitoring and invasion of privacy was thin, but when danger loomed, it was a distinction that mattered little.\n\nHe'd learned to be mindful of his words, to consider the reach they might have. To think before posting, before sharing. The world, it seemed, was a fragile tapestry, where a single misstep could unravel the entire fabric. And in this vast and unforgiving expanse, he'd do well to remember the lesson of the voided spaces - that words, once spoken, could not be recalled, and their consequences, forever unbound.",
            "In the wasteland of reason, the war has been reduced to a hollow shell of its former purpose. What was once a crusade to restore democracy in a foreign land has devolved into a protracted exercise in futility. The original intent, to bring light to a land shrouded in tyranny, has been lost in the dust of time. The ghosts of George Bush's past animosities with Saddam Hussein still linger, casting a shadow over the true motivations behind the war.\n\nThe initial spark, a beacon of hope in the darkness, has flickered out, leaving behind a smoldering ember of justification. The war, once a clarion call to freedom, has become a Sisyphean task, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and despair. The first skirmishes, a decisive blow for democracy, have given way to a drawn-out stalemate, a war of attrition that has drained the lifeblood from our economy.\n\nWe were once driven by a noble purpose, a desire to liberate a people from the shackles of oppression. But that purpose has been eroded, worn down by the relentless tides of time. We have lost sight of the initial goal, and now we are mired in a quagmire of our own making. The war has become a self-perpetuating machine, a monster that feeds on our resources, our lives, and our very soul.\n\nThe cost is staggering, a drain on our economy that could be better spent on the pressing needs of our own people. The wars on poverty, education, and healthcare cry out for attention, but our treasure is squandered on a conflict that has long since lost its way. We are bleeding our treasury dry, sacrificing our own citizens on the altar of a cause that has been lost.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to a simple question: what is the true cost of our actions? Is it not time to acknowledge that the war has been a failure, a Pyrrhic victory that has achieved nothing but the perpetuation of a cycle of violence? We must confront the reality of our situation, and acknowledge that it is time to bring this sense of purpose to an end. The war has outlived its usefulness, and it is time to let it go.",
            "A question hung unspoken, like a thing of fragile glass suspended in the air, waiting to shatter. It had to do with the tracings of the past, the echoes of moments lived and lost, and the fragile boundaries of a person's private self. He recalled the words of an old man, a sage from a bygone era, who said that once a thing was placed upon the altar of the internet, it was as though it had been cast to the winds, subject to the whims of an unfeeling world. And so it was with Myspace, a digital realm where the veil of anonymity was but a thin membrane, easily pierced by the prying eyes of others.\n\nHe had heard the tale of a young soul, a wanderer in the digital wilderness, who had stumbled upon a profile, a digital shrine to a person's innermost thoughts and desires. And in that moment, a life was saved, a potential catastrophe averted. Yet, the boy's words hung in the air, a query that spoke to the very heart of the issue: was it right to expect that others would watch over us, to shield us from the dangers that lurked in the shadows of the net?\n\nHe thought of the boy's words, of the fragile balance between freedom and safety, between the desire for anonymity and the need for protection. It was a delicate dance, a precarious tightrope walked by those who ventured into the digital realm. And the consequences of a misstep? Ah, those were as uncertain as the wind that whipped through the dead trees, as ephemeral as the ashes that swirled in the breeze.\n\nIn the end, it was a question that begged for no easy answer, a riddle without a solution. For in the world of the internet, the lines between public and private were blurred, the boundaries between freedom and surveillance ever-shifting. And so, the boy's question hung in the air, a haunting reminder of the fragility of the human heart, and the uncertain future that lay ahead.",
            "The ghosts of war still linger in the ash-scarred landscape. The Iraq War, a calamity of unyielding proportions, continues to haunt us, a specter of hubris and miscalculation. To speak of it now feels like an exercise in futility, a vain attempt to grasp the ungraspable. And yet, I am drawn to the void, compelled to confront the ruin that we have wrought.\n\nLike a man wandering through a desolate landscape, I find myself torn between the weight of conviction and the crushing weight of doubt. I was against the war from the beginning, yet now it seems almost irrelevant, a fact lost in the din of history. The polls, a cacophony of numbers and opinions, scream in unison: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world, eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops, all concurring in their assessment: this war was a grave mistake.\n\nThe administration's recklessness, a product of its own myopia, blinds it to the inherent contradictions of its actions. The Middle East, a cauldron of ancient animosities and cultural fault lines, defies the simplistic notions of democracy and progress. The notion that we can impose our will upon this complex tapestry, that we can somehow \"bring democracy\" to a region where it has never taken root, is a conceit born of arrogance and ignorance.\n\nSaddam, a monstrous figure, may have been a bad man, but his ousting has unleashed a maelstrom of chaos, a quagmire from which we may never extricate ourselves. The administration's talking points, a jumble of half-truths and convenient fictions, fail to convince. The problems of withdrawal, they claim, are too dire, too complex. But I see no legitimate reason to stay. The voices of the Iraqis, the people we claim to be saving, cry out for our departure. Eighty percent, a staggering majority, demand our withdrawal within the year. And what of the quarter who urge us to leave now? Might they not know better than we, the would-be saviors, what is best for their own land?\n\nIf we leave, we can absolve ourselves of responsibility for the disaster that has unfolded. We can say, with a modicum of truth, that we were forced to withdraw by the will of the Iraqi people. But even this weak excuse will not suffice. We will never be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, not now, not ever. All we can hope for is to mitigate the damage, to leave with a semblance of dignity, rather than the ignominy of continued occupation.\n\nAnd so I ask: what now? How do we extricate ourselves from this festering wound? The answer, like the war itself, remains elusive, a mirage on the horizon of history. But one thing is certain: we must leave, and we must leave soon. The ghosts of war will not rest until we do.",
            "The air was heavy with the weight of unspoken truths, like the faint scent of rain on a dry earth. The fire of equality still smoldered, a flickering flame that danced with the wind of societal norms. I believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, a cancer that seeps into the marrow of our being. It is not a question of men and women alone, but rather the consequence of a culture that has been shaped by the past.\n\nIn the field of work, the glass ceiling still looms, a reminder that even with equality on the books, it is a struggle to shatter the silence of a legacy that reveres the status quo. Women, in particular, face a daunting task in piercing the veil of prejudice, for it is a world that has been crafted to favor the masculine. They strive to reach the pinnacle of success, only to find themselves hemmed in by the fragile glass that separates them from the upper echelons of power.\n\nBut it is not just women who face this trial. Men, too, are bound by the chains of societal expectation. Those who choose to stay at home, to nurture and care for their children, are met with skepticism and scorn, their masculinity called into question. The world looks upon them with a mixture of disdain and confusion, unable to comprehend the notion of a man who puts family above the altar of profit.\n\nIn the fashion industry, the stereotypes are even more pronounced. Men who dare to venture into this realm are often met with suspicion, their seriousness doubted, their passion questioned. They are seen as anomalies, outsiders who do not belong, their masculinity suspect because of their association with a world that is deemed feminine.\n\nBut change is a slow and tortuous process. It is a journey that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to challenge the status quo. We have come a long way, to be sure, but we still have far to go. The fight for equality is not a battle to be won overnight, but a marathon that demands our collective effort.\n\nPerhaps the key to progress lies not in forcing the issue, but in promoting the qualities that define us as individuals. By celebrating the strengths and weaknesses of those who are often stereotyped, we can begin to break down the walls that separate us. We must recognize that intelligence and worth are not solely the domain of the well-spoken, but rather the province of those who dare to be different.\n\nUltimately, the fight for equality is a journey that knows no bounds, a path that winds through the complexities of our collective experience. It is a road that is fraught with obstacles, but one that holds the promise of a brighter tomorrow. As we move forward, let us not forget that change is a gradual process, one that requires our collective effort and our unwavering commitment to the cause.\n\nIn the end, it is not just about men and women, but about the humanity that unites us all. It is about recognizing that we are all equal, that we are all deserving of respect and dignity, regardless of our background or our profession. And it is this understanding that will ultimately guide us toward a future where equality is not just a dream, but a reality.",
            "The understanding of the legal landscape is that they did not completely legalize it, but rather decriminalized it, stripping it of its former status as a felony charge. It is now akin to a traffic infraction, one that garners a citation rather than a full-blown arrest and prolonged court proceedings. Those who are caught are not burdened with the weight of a formal conviction, a concern that had previously hampered many who worried about the long-term implications on their future prospects, such as employment and social standing. Yet, there exists a counterargument that the fiscal burden of policing and prosecuting such offenses is considerable. The cost of apprehending, detaining, and processing individuals, only to release them later, can be a significant drain on municipal resources. Many financially strained municipalities hesitate to adopt such a measure, even if it would free up capital for more pressing needs.\n\nHowever, in places where public opinion leans more liberal, like Denver, decriminalization has become a matter of course. The resulting windfall of revenue has been redirected toward vital community programs, such as education, social services for the elderly, and feeding initiatives for those in need. It is a pragmatic approach that acknowledges the dual nature of this substance – its potential benefits and drawbacks. While its widespread availability might prove a concern, the financial and social implications of its prohibition cannot be ignored.\n\nOne of the lingering reservations about marijuana legalization pertains to its societal acceptance. Some worry that its widespread availability would undermine the cultural taboo surrounding it, leading to public use and, by extension, impaired driving. However, it is worth noting that alcohol, another substance with well-documented impairing effects, has yet to be fully eradicated from our society. Each substance has its unique impact on individuals, influenced by factors such as personality and life choices.\n\nModeration and self-control are key, as people's reactions to substances can vary significantly. It is challenging to generalize about the effects of marijuana, as individuals respond differently. Both alcohol and marijuana have negative consequences, and while some individuals can navigate these substances with ease, others may struggle. This nuanced understanding highlights the complexity of the issue, underscoring the importance of continued dialogue and informed decision-making.",
            "The notion of adhering to tradition is a weight that settles heavy upon the soul. Like the slow accumulation of ash on a weathered stone, the rituals and practices of a bygone era can suffocate the very life that seeks to breathe within them. The Catholic Church, an institution steeped in the rich soil of tradition, stands as a testament to this assertion. Its dogma, a labyrinth of doctrine and teaching, binds the faithful to a strict adherence to the ways of old.\n\nYet, like a river that refuses to be contained, change always seeks to seep into the cracks of the established order. The Church, too, has been shaped by the currents of time, its own waters churning with the disparate voices of its followers. The tension between tradition and adaptability is a chasm that yawns wide, threatening to swallow the very foundations of the institution.\n\nA passage of time, a span of years, a silence of decades – and the world shifts, ever so imperceptibly. The Church, too, must shift, or risk being consumed by the very traditions it seeks to uphold. And yet, like a tree that clings to its ancient roots, it resists the gentle tug of progress. The result is a disconnect, a schism that runs deep, a gulf that separates the teachings of the Church from the lived experience of its followers.\n\nConsider, if you will, the doctrine of love. \"Love thy neighbor as thyself,\" a teaching that echoes through the halls of scripture. And yet, the practice of the Church often seems to falter in its application of this very principle. The prohibition against marrying outside the faith, the rejection of those who do not conform to the established norms – these are but a few examples of the disconnect that exists between the teachings of the Church and the lived reality of its followers.\n\nThe issue of priestly marriage is a case in point. Some argue that allowing priests to wed would help to curb the scourge of pedophilia that has ravaged the Church. But is this not a simplistic solution, one that fails to address the deeper rot that festers within the institution? The abuse of power, the corruption of the sacred – these are not solved by the mere act of marriage. They require a fundamental shift in the way the Church views itself, a recognition that its teachings must be lived, not merely recited.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution that will save us, but the individuals who comprise it. It is not the tradition that will heal the wounds of the past, but the willingness to confront them head-on. As the world outside continues to shift and change, the Church must do the same, lest it be left behind, a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of a time when tradition was more important than the lives of its followers.",
            "A thing that weighs upon my mind, a matter that defies easy resolution. I find myself torn, suspended between the crevices of a dichotomy. The line separating church and state, a divide so fine it's nigh impossible to traverse. And the notion of marriage, a concept as slippery as a snake through the grass. It's a puzzle, a riddle, a thing that shifts and writhes like a living thing.\n\nI'm not one to take a stand, to stake my claim on a particular side of the fence. But I will say this: the boundaries between civil union and sacrament blur and blend like the hues of a sunset. Marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil contract to others. And what of the government's role in all this? Should it concern itself with the sanctity of the union, or merely the legalities? I think it should be the latter. The state's domain is one of law, not dogma.\n\nThe fact that gay marriage is a topic of debate at all speaks to the intractability of the issue. It's a tempest in a teapot, a storm that rages and churns but ultimately resolves into nothing. And yet, it's a tempest that refuses to dissipate, a maelstrom that draws in the unwary. The constitution, a document of grand import, is not a vessel for the whims of the masses. It's a framework, a structure that guides us, not a plaything for the passions of the day.\n\nTo amend the constitution for the sake of banning gay marriage is a notion that strikes me as... misguided. A constitutional amendment is a solemn thing, a weighty matter that should not be taken lightly. It's a decision that should be approached with caution, with trepidation. And yet, in this case, I fear it's a decision that's driven more by emotion than reason.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a home where the words of scripture held sway, where the teachings of the Lord were the guiding force behind every decision. Yet, as I've grown and navigated the complexities of the world, I've found myself drawn to the fringes of that faith, questioning the certainties I once held dear. The matter of homosexuality, in particular, has caused me to wrestle with the fine lines that separate conviction and compassion.\n\nI've had the privilege of forming friendships with individuals who walk a path I don't fully understand, and in doing so, I've come to see the humanity in their struggles. I don't pretend to comprehend the intricacies of their experiences, but I do know that they are not so different from my own. We are all seekers, stumbling through the darkness, searching for a glimmer of light.\n\nAs I've grappled with this issue, I've come to the realization that I don't share the same fervor as some of my contemporaries. I don't see the world in binary terms, where one choice is the only acceptable path. Instead, I believe that the complexities of human emotion and experience demand a more nuanced approach. I think that individuals should have the freedom to live their lives as they see fit, as long as they're not harming others.\n\nThe notion that our leaders should dictate how we live our private lives feels suffocating. The idea that one person's perspective should be imposed upon an entire nation strikes me as a recipe for division and strife. I believe that each state should have the autonomy to determine its own values and laws, rather than relying on a single individual to make decisions for the masses.\n\nIt's a matter of personal responsibility, of living with the consequences of our choices. If I choose to reside in a state that has chosen to legalize gay marriage, then I must respect their decision, even if it differs from my own. I don't believe it's my place to dictate how others live their lives, as long as they're not infringing upon my own rights.\n\nThe notion that a single leader, like President Bush, should have the authority to impose his will on the nation feels anachronistic. He doesn't live in every state; he doesn't bear the weight of every decision that affects the people of this land. His term in office is finite, and when it ends, the decision will ultimately rest with those who come after him.\n\nIn the end, it's up to each individual state to chart its own course, to navigate the complexities of human experience. It's a messy, imperfect process, but it's one that acknowledges the diversity of our nation and the autonomy of its people. I believe that's where true freedom lies – not in the dictates of a single leader, but in the choices we make as individuals, as communities, and as a nation.",
            "The world of the internet, a vast and unfettered expanse where the gaze of the public is unfettered. A bulletin board, a forum for the airing of one's thoughts and intentions, where the pixelated eyes of the world converge to witness the unfolding drama of the self. And yet, the notion of privacy, that fragile and tenuous thing, is lost in the ether like autumn leaves on a gusty day.\n\nThe school officials, those guardians of the academic halls, had every right to peer into the recesses of a student's digital life. For in the public realm, all is fair game. The internet, a labyrinth of interconnected threads, beckons the curious and the prurient alike to explore its depths. And those who venture there do so with the knowledge that their every move is being watched, their every thought laid bare for all to see.\n\nBut what of the school's responsibility to safeguard its charges? Is it not the duty of those who oversee the halls of learning to ensure the well-being of their pupils? To shield them from the dangers that lurk in the shadows of the digital world, where the past and present converge in a maelstrom of consequences. The Columbine incident, a dark and foreboding specter, haunts the dreams of educators, a reminder of the potential for violence that lurks in the hearts of the young.\n\nThe school officials, then, were merely doing their duty, seeking to avert the catastrophe that could have befallen upon them. By monitoring the online lives of their students, they acted to prevent the very thing they feared - the unleashing of chaos and destruction. And in this, they stood as the sentinels of a fragile and besieged institution, ever vigilant in their pursuit of a safer, more secure environment.\n\nBut what of the individual's right to privacy, that cherished and oft-abused notion? Does not the student's expectation of anonymity in the digital realm take precedence over the school's responsibility to safeguard its charges? The answer, much like the digital footprints we leave behind, is a fleeting and ephemeral thing, lost in the vast and uncaring expanse of the internet.\n\nIn the end, it is not the internet that is the problem, but rather our own expectations of it. We venture into this vast and unfettered expanse with the hope of connection, of community, and of expression. But we do so at the risk of being seen, of being watched, and of being judged. And it is in this tension that we find the crux of the matter - the delicate balance between the pursuit of self and the need for safety.",
            "A vast and desolate emptiness had settled within me, a chasm carved by the events of nine eleven. At first, I was a vessel for the fervor that swept the land, my heart afire with a desire for retribution. The wounds of that day still lingered, a festering sore that seemed to cry out for salve. I was convinced that invasion was the answer, that the imposition of our will would bring order to the chaos. But as the months passed, a creeping doubt began to take hold. We had charged into the fray without a clear plan, our hearts heavy with emotion and our minds clouded by anger. We spoke of liberation, but did we truly understand the complexities of the land we sought to shape?\n\nThe people we sought to free were a tapestry woven from many threads, threads that were often at odds with one another. They were a people prone to savagery, their wars a brutal and unyielding thing. And I began to wonder if we were merely pawns in their game, if our presence was little more than a catalyst for their own internecine conflicts. The more I considered it, the more I came to believe that our intervention had been a mistake, a folly born of passion rather than prudence. We had attempted to impose our will upon a people who would not be swayed, who would not be changed. And in the end, it was we who were the ones who were changed, our hearts hardened by the experience.\n\nI often think of my uncle's words, spoken on a long-ago day by the lake's edge. He had taught me that the world was a complex and multifaceted thing, that its workings were not always easy to understand. And I began to see that our actions in that far-off land had been a testament to our own ignorance, our own arrogance. We had charged in with guns blazing, convinced of our own righteousness, but in the end, it was we who were left with the wounds.\n\nI do not know what the future holds, but I do know that our presence in that land has been a futile endeavor. We have made progress, to be sure, but it is progress that will not last. The land will continue to be a battleground, a place of bloodshed and strife. And we will be the ones who are left to pick up the pieces, to wonder why we had thought we could change the course of history. It is a lesson I will carry with me for the rest of my days, a reminder of the futility of our endeavors, and the dangers of acting without thought or foresight."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The once-venerable institution of the Catholic Church stands at a crossroads, its waning influence a symptom of a broader malaise. A disconnect between the Church's stance on certain issues and the evolving values of its adherents has precipitated a decline in devotion. The Church's dogmatic views on matters like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, though well-intentioned, have grown archaic in their rigidity. By failing to adapt to the shifting tides of modernity, the Church risks losing its flock to a younger generation that demands a more inclusive and compassionate understanding.\n\nA Church that clings to an outdated worldview risks alienating those who would otherwise seek solace in its teachings. The specter of judgment and intolerance that hangs over certain issues drives away the very souls it seeks to nurture. In an era where the boundaries of acceptance are expanding, the Church's inflexibility appears as a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe prohibition on female priests and married clergy only serves to further exacerbate the disconnect. In an age where women hold positions of power and authority in nearly every sphere, the notion that they are somehow less suited to the priesthood seems anachronistic. And yet, despite this, the Church remains adamant in its stance. The consequences of this rigidity are evident in the dwindling numbers of adherents who feel unwelcome in a community that refuses to evolve.\n\nBut would even the relaxation of these rules have altered the course of events? It is impossible to know, and perhaps it is hubris to assume that such concessions would have been enough to prevent the exodus of devotees. The wounds run too deep, and the wounds of history cannot be so easily healed.\n\nAnd yet, it is precisely this inflexibility that raises the question: why must priests be unmarried? The Church's assertion that they are wedded to God is laudable, but it is a notion that rings hollow when set against the lived experience of those who have dedicated their lives to other pursuits. Why must the clergy be singled out for a life of solitary devotion? In a world where men and women must navigate the complexities of family and career, why must priests be exempt from these same challenges?\n\nIt is a question that speaks to the very heart of the Church's identity. Does it truly believe that its adherents are bound to a higher calling, one that supersedes the demands of the flesh? Or does it merely cling to a tradition that has outlived its purpose? The answer to this question will determine the course of the Church's future, and whether it will find a way to reclaim its relevance in a world that is rapidly leaving it behind.",
            "The existence of two souls bound in love is not a choice. It is an unyielding condition, an inescapable truth that defies the strictures of societal norms. I do not pretend to be an authority on the matter, but I do know this: that the manner in which one is born is not a decision, but a fate. We are each born with a certain inclination, a certain affinity, a certain unshakeable sense of self. The choice, if it can be called that, lies not in the heart's allegiance, but in the world's acceptance.\n\nTo deny two souls the right to consecrate their love, to bind themselves in matrimony, is to deny the inherent dignity of their existence. It is to imply that their love is somehow aberrant, somehow less authentic than the love between two souls of opposite sexes. I do not believe this to be the case. I believe that love knows no bounds, no distinctions, no limitations. It is a force that transcends the petty constraints of human convention.\n\nThe federal government, with its erstwhile authority, should not interfere in the private lives of its citizens. The issue of same-sex marriage is not a matter of national security, nor is it a question of moral rectitude. It is a question of basic human rights, of the freedom to love without fear of reprisal or persecution. The government should not seek to impose its will upon those who would seek to love as they are. It should not seek to dictate the terms of their existence.\n\nUltimately, the question of same-sex marriage is a simple one: should we not allow two souls to love as they are, to bind themselves together in the bond of matrimony, free from the constraints of societal expectation? I believe that we should. The world may view their love as aberrant, but I do not. I see it for what it is: a testament to the human spirit, a testament to the enduring power of love in all its forms.",
            "In the desolate expanse of our society, a fundamental question lingers, a specter that haunts the fringes of our collective conscience: the legalization of gay marriage. The wind howls through the barren lands, whipping up dust devils of ignorance and prejudice, as we stumble through the wasteland of our moral ambiguities.\n\nIt is a notion that has long been shrouded in an impenetrable haze, a mystery waiting to be unraveled. Many claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, a notion that is as baseless as the ash that blankets the earth. For what is a family, truly? Is it not two souls bound together by love and commitment, regardless of the intricacies of their relationship? Is it not a bond that transcends the petty squabbles of society, a union that speaks to the very essence of human connection?\n\nBut the proponents of this antiquated view cling to their biases, their arguments as hollow as the shells of the wind-blasted trees that line our roads. They claim that gay couples are somehow less worthy of recognition, that their love is an aberration, a deviation from the norm. But what is normal, truly? Is it not the pursuit of happiness, the yearning for connection that defines us as human beings? And is not love the very fabric that weaves our lives together?\n\nThe statistics are clear: gay couples exhibit the same rates of success, the same factors contributing to satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts. They are not asking for the right to wed in a church, but for a simple marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the very government that claims to represent us all. Why, then, must we deny them this fundamental right? Is it not a matter of fairness, of equality? Or are we content to live in a society where some are more equal than others?\n\nThe segregation of separate but unequal is a hollow argument, a feeble attempt to justify the injustices that we inflict upon one another. We speak of morality, of the teachings of our churches, but do we not risk hypocrisy when we allow our personal beliefs to dictate the laws of our land? Can we truly claim to be a just society when we deny the rights of a segment of our population simply because of their sexual orientation?\n\nAnd what of the children, those precious innocents who are caught in the crossfire of our prejudices? Do we not risk inflicting upon them a lifetime of pain and suffering by denying their parents the rights and privileges that we take for granted? The American Psychological Association has spoken, and their words are clear: the claims of psychological damage are unfounded, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nAs we stumble through this desolate landscape, we would do well to remember that our opinions are not the only ones that matter. We would do well to listen to the institutions that have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge, to the research and studies that have shed light on this issue. For in the end, it is not our personal biases that will decide the fate of gay marriage, but our collective willingness to recognize the inherent value of every human being.\n\nLet us not be swayed by the winds of ignorance, but rather by the gentle breeze of compassion and understanding. Let us walk the narrow path of justice, and let us ensure that our society is a place where love knows no bounds, where every individual is treated with dignity and respect. For in the end, it is not the laws that we make, but the hearts that we hold that truly define us as human beings.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy, where the fluorescent lights hum a monotonous dirge, I toil in the sweltering summer months. The smell of antiseptic wafts through the air, a constant reminder of the fragility of life. Yet, amidst this sterile backdrop, I find myself pondering the oft-maligned subject of illicit substances. \n\nJust as the law's restrictive grasp cannot deny the medicinal virtues of certain controlled substances, such as oxycodone or Vicodin, so too must we not dismiss the potential benefits of cannabis. The notion that a drug's illegality somehow negates its utility is a fallacy, a product of societal taboo rather than scientific fact. \n\nAs a pharmacy technician, I've witnessed firsthand the responsible use of prohibited substances in medical contexts. Why, then, do we not extend the same consideration to marijuana? The parallels between the two, though imperfect, are striking. Like alcohol, marijuana's abuse can lead to deleterious consequences; yet, just as we do not outlaw the latter, we should not hastily condemn the former. \n\nPerhaps the key lies in a gradual, measured approach, rather than an abrupt shift in policy. By first dismantling the stigmatized image surrounding marijuana, we may foster a more responsible attitude towards its use. The vilification of this substance has created a misconception, one that obscures its potential therapeutic benefits. By acknowledging these advantages, we may yet unlock a new frontier in medicine. \n\nBut alas, the ingrained prejudices run deep. The specter of heroin and cocaine looms large, casting a dark shadow over marijuana's reputation. It is a stubborn stain, one that requires time, patience, and a willingness to reexamine our assumptions. Only then can we hope to transcend the haze of misconception and unlock the truth behind this oft-maligned substance.",
            "In a world that has shed its staidness, the church has undergone a metamorphosis, adapting to the twenty-first century with a newfound flexibility. No longer a bastion of rigidity, it has begun to shed the strictures of its former self, its once-imposing façade now worn and weathered by the whispers of time.\n\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I am reminded of the church as it was in my youth – a place of solemnity and reverence, where the air was thick with the scent of sanctity and the rustle of starched fabric. Every Sunday, I donned my Sunday best – a demure dress, matching shoes, and a purse to match – and joined my friends at the private school I attended on weekends. The ritual was a comforting one, a sense of predictability that anchored me in a world that seemed to be spinning ever more rapidly.\n\nBut as I grew older, I noticed a subtle yet profound change. The church, once a bastion of tradition, began to succumb to the zeitgeist of a more casual era. The teenage mass, a innovation that sought to engage the younger generation, was a telling sign of the times. Services were now neatly condensed into thirty minutes, a fleeting snapshot of devotion in an increasingly harried world. The once-formal attire gave way to a more relaxed, even casual, dress code. Summer Sundays saw beachwear creeping into the pews, a testament to the church's willingness to adapt.\n\nAs I observe this shift, I am struck by the essence of the institution. The church, like the world around it, is a reflection of humanity's evolving values. It is a place where tradition and innovation coexist, where the sacred and the mundane intersect. And yet, despite this adaptability, the church remains a cipher, an enigma that continues to elude my understanding.\n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I am reminded of the complexity of human nature. The notion that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these atrocities is a simplistic one. Pedophilia, I believe, is a product of genetics, a deeply ingrained aspect of an individual's makeup. It is not a choice, a vice that can be eradicated through marriage or any other means. The church, like any institution, is a reflection of humanity at its worst and best. While it is true that some priests have been accused of abuse, it is also true that many have dedicated their lives to selfless service.\n\nThe example of Seventh Heaven, a denomination that allows its ministers to marry, serves as a counterpoint to the Catholic Church's stance. Yet, it also highlights the individual's choice to pursue a particular faith or vocation. If an individual's desires are at odds with the requirements of their faith, perhaps it is time to reevaluate their commitment.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers. The Catholic Church, like the world around it, is a tapestry of contradictions – a place of beauty and ugliness, of light and darkness. Its evolution is a reflection of humanity's own, a slow and halting process that grapples with the complexities of existence.",
            "The ashes of the century still lingered, a cold and festering wound that refused to heal. The echoes of a calamitous day still lingered, a hollowed-out refrain that seemed to seep into every pore. The wounds of September's brutal birth pangs still bled, a festering sore that had yet to scab. The nation's collective psyche remained a maelstrom of anger, a churning sea of discontent that threatened to engulf all in its path. The winds of war had been fanned by the whispers of a pretext, a thin veil of deceit that had been woven to conceal the true intent of those who held the reins.\n\nThe Bush administration, a cabal of men driven by a zealot's fervor, had set the nation ablaze with a war of choice, a conflict born of hubris and a desire for dominance. The lies had been legion, a litany of half-truths and outright fabrications that had been peddled to the public with a zeal that bordered on the fanatical. The notion that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to the nation's security, that he harbored weapons of mass destruction, was a myth, a chimera conjured by the fevered imagination of those who would seek to justify their actions.\n\nAnd yet, even now, the wounds ran deep, a festering sore that refused to heal. The Constitution, that sacred document that had been the cornerstone of the nation's foundation, had been trampled, its principles and ideals cast aside like so much rubbish. The disregard for the rule of law, the flaunting of power, had become a hallmark of the administration, a litany of abuses that had been perpetrated with impunity.\n\nAs the nation teetered on the brink of collapse, the question remained: what had been the true intention of the war? Was it a quest for oil, a desire to secure the nation's energy needs, or was it something more sinister, a bid for dominance in a world that was rapidly changing? The answer, much like the truth, remained shrouded in mystery, a enigma that refused to yield to the probing of reason.\n\nThe situation in Iraq, a quagmire of chaos and confusion, seemed to be spiraling out of control. The interim government, a fragile entity, teetered on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty threatened by the very nations that sought to prop it up. The Parliament, a body supposedly empowered to govern, was a mere shell of its former self, a hollow vessel devoid of purpose or direction. The radicals, a cauldron of dissent and discontent, simmered just below the surface, waiting to boil over and engulf all in their path.\n\nAnd yet, even in the midst of this maelstrom, a glimmer of hope remained. A coalition of nations, a patchwork of interests and ideologies, sought to impose order on the chaos, to bring a modicum of stability to a nation on the brink of collapse. But would it be enough? Or would the very attempts to impose order only serve to exacerbate the problem, to sow the seeds of discord and strife that would ultimately lead to a bitter harvest of blood and tears?\n\nOnly time would tell, but one thing was certain: the wounds of the past would not easily heal, and the future, like the present, remained shrouded in uncertainty, a dark and foreboding mist that threatened to engulf all in its path.",
            "He spoke in hushed tones, his words lost in the haze of indecision.  I'm not sure where to begin, he said, the words like ashes on his tongue.  The War in Iraq, a thing that had consumed the air, the news, the very fabric of life.  He thought of it as a beast, a thing that gnawed at the edges of the world, leaving only ruin in its wake.\n\nIt was a war that had never been declared, a shadowy thing that lurched forward with a hunger for power and for oil.  They had gone in with guns and bombs, with a promise of democracy and freedom.  But it had become a thing of ash and dust, a desolate landscape of burned cities and shattered lives.\n\nHe thought of the families, the sons and daughters who had gone to fight, leaving behind the warmth of home and the comfort of loved ones.  Their faces etched in his mind like the faces of the dead.  The ones who had come back, their eyes haunted, their hearts heavy with the weight of what they had seen.\n\nHe thought of the people of Iraq, their culture shattered, their lives torn apart by the very forces that had come to help.  The Al-Kaida, a hydra-like thing that seemed to grow stronger with each passing day.  Their hatred for the United States a thing that deepened with each passing moment.\n\nHe didn't know what to think, what to feel.  It was a morass of conflicting emotions, a tangle of threads that he couldn't seem to untangle.  He felt a sense of responsibility, a sense of duty to the boys and girls who had gone to fight.  But he also felt a sense of shame, a sense of guilt for the lives that had been lost, the lives that had been torn apart.\n\nThe words tumbled out of him like a confession, a prayer, a plea for understanding.  It was a war that had become a thing of ash and dust, a desolate landscape of burned cities and shattered lives.  He didn't know if it was worth it, if the cost had been worth the gain.  All he knew was that it was a thing that would haunt him, a thing that would stay with him for the rest of his days.\n\nThe words trailed off, lost in the silence.  He was left with only questions, only doubts.  The War in Iraq, a thing that had consumed the air, the news, the very fabric of life.  A thing that would haunt him, a thing that would stay with him forever.",
            "The notion of imposing a law, a declaration of what is permissible or not, strikes a discordant note within me. It is a notion that borders on the hubris of those who would seek to impose their will upon the realm of the sacred, of the churches, where faith and conviction hold sway. The constitution, that enduring testament to the principles of our nation, speaks of the separation of church and state, a clear and unmistakable demarcation between the realms of the temporal and the eternal. To tamper with this balance would be to invite chaos, to upset the delicate equipoise that has been established.\n\nThe churches, not the government, are the proper arbiters of such matters. It is they who have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of the divine, who have walked the hallowed paths of faith for centuries. The government, with its pretensions to omniscience, should not usurp the authority of the churches. To do so would be to elevate the mundane over the sacred, to confuse the roles of the temporal and the eternal.\n\nThe notion of an amendment, of a law imposed by the hand of the state, would be a perversion of the principles that our constitution enshrines. It would be a restriction, not of the government, but of the people, a stifling of their freedom to worship, to believe as they see fit. And for what purpose? To impose the will of one church, one creed, upon the many? It is a notion devoid of merit, a relic of a outdated thinking that would seek to impose a narrow, dogmatic view upon a pluralistic society.\n\nI do not see the rationale behind such an amendment, save for the personal convictions of a few. The president's actions, in pushing for such a law, smack of a disregard for the separation of church and state, a willingness to impose his own views upon the nation, in direct contravention of the principles enshrined in our constitution. It is a step down a perilous path, one that would lead us further down the road of intolerance, of restriction, of the stifling of individual freedom.\n\nIn truth, I see little reason for such an amendment. It would do little to improve our economy, our society, our lives. In fact, it might have a negative impact, stifling the very freedoms that our nation was founded upon. The government should not be involved in this issue, should not seek to impose its will upon the churches. The people, in their diversity, should be free to worship as they see fit, to follow the dictates of their hearts, not the edicts of the state.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should not be involved in this matter. The churches, not the government, should be the arbiters of such issues. The constitution, that sacred document, speaks clearly and unequivocally on this matter. Let us not forget its words, let us not forget the principles that have guided us thus far. Let us preserve the separation of church and state, and allow the people to worship as they see fit, free from the interference of the state.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict born of deceit and hubris. It was a war that began as a shroud of secrecy, a tangled web of half-truths and misdirection. The government's justifications, a whispered litany of lies, designed to stir the passions of the American people, to cloak the invasion in a mantle of righteousness. The echoes of September 11th, a distant memory, a false pretext for the blood-soaked sands of Mesopotamia. The drums of war beat out a rhythm of fear and anger, a siren's song that lured the nation into the abyss.\n\nWe were a people, lost and searching, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own self-importance. We were told that the Iraqi government was a monster, a grotesque and malevolent force that threatened our very way of life. But was it not a lie? Were we not being deceived, led astray by the insidious whisperings of our own leaders? The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a cautionary tale of a war that had been lost, a war that had claimed the lives of countless young men, a war that had left a nation scarred and bitter.\n\nAnd yet, we walked into the void, blind and unprepared, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own arrogance. We removed the government, leaving a power vacuum, a chasm of chaos that would swallow us whole. The aftermath, a nightmarish tapestry of blood and fire, a litany of death and despair. The insurgency, a hydra-headed beast, a creature that would not be slain. We fought the citizens, the very people we claimed to liberate, and we were defeated.\n\nWe were not prepared for the consequences of our actions, nor did we understand the nature of the enemy we faced. We were naive, blinded by our own righteousness, our own self-importance. We were not fighting an army, but a people, a people who refused to be subjugated, a people who would not be silenced. The war in Iraq, a repeat of the mistakes of the past, a war that would haunt us for generations to come.\n\nWe are still there, mired in the quagmire, our casualties mounting, our dreams of a free and democratic Iraq slipping further and further away. The oil, a siren's song, a lure that beckoned us to the abyss. The true reasons for the war, shrouded in secrecy, hidden from the prying eyes of the public. The lies, the half-truths, the misdirection, a cleverly woven tapestry of deceit.\n\nAnd so we are stuck, trapped in a cycle of violence and fear, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own hubris. We are a people, lost and searching, our way forward shrouded in uncertainty. The war in Iraq, a dark and foreboding presence, a shadow that looms over our collective conscience. We can only hope that it will end soon, that the bloodshed will cease, and that peace will return to that troubled land.",
            "The thought stirs like a flame in the dark, a flickering thing that refuses to be extinguished. I am drawn to it, this notion of love without bounds, of two souls entwined in a dance of devotion. It is a notion that has long been a part of me, a whispered promise to myself, a gentle urging to break free from the constraints of a world that seeks to define us by the whims of others.\n\nIn the stillness of night, when the world is hushed and the shadows reign, I am reminded of the fragility of life, the ephemeral nature of our existence. And yet, in this fleeting moment, I find solace in the knowledge that love knows no bounds, that it can transcend the confines of societal expectations, of familial norms, of ancient traditions. It is a love that is raw, unbridled, and unapologetic, a love that refuses to be silenced by the whispers of doubt and fear.\n\nI have always believed that love is a fundamental right, a basic human necessity that should be granted to all, regardless of the labels we assign to it. It is a right that should be protected, cherished, and upheld, not denied or diminished by the arrogance of those who would seek to impose their will upon others. For love is not a choice, it is a calling, a primal urge that cannot be tamed or controlled.\n\nIn this bleak and barren world, where the winds howl and the ash falls like a shroud, I find hope in the resilience of the human spirit. I see it in the way two people, bound by love, can weather the storms, can face the darkness, and can emerge stronger, more steadfast, and more unbreakable. It is a love that is forged in the fire of adversity, tempered by the trials of a world that seeks to tear us apart.\n\nAnd so, I stand steadfast in my conviction, unwavering in my resolve. I believe that love knows no bounds, that it is a fundamental right, a basic human necessity that should be upheld and cherished. I believe that love is a flame that burns bright, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of it. And I believe that it is a love that should be free to flourish, unencumbered by the constraints of societal expectations, unshackled by the chains of oppression.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the laws that govern us, nor the politics that divide us, nor the norms that constrain us, that truly matter. It is the love that we share, the love that we give, and the love that we receive. It is the love that burns within us, a flame that flickers brightly, a light that shines brightly in the darkness.",
            "He'd learned the lesson of the voided spaces where words reside. Where thoughts without borders spread like ash on the wind. When something was placed in the public expanse, it lost all vestige of sanctuary. It became a thing without bounds, a thing that could not be recalled. A thing that would forever bear the weight of perception. As an RA, he'd witnessed it firsthand - the careless utterances, the misplaced words that could spark a fire. The bulletin that arrived at the school, its origin unknown, a harbinger of dread. The friends who'd stumbled upon it, their faces etched with concern. The search for the source, the parsing of intent. The line between jest and gravity, forever blurred.\n\nThe internet, a vast and unforgiving plain, where words were currency and reputation was the cost. No refuge from the gaze of the many, where the private was an illusion. When you entered the public sphere, you surrendered to the whims of others. You couldn't dictate how they'd receive your words, or what they'd make of them. The school officials, bound by duty, had to act on the information they gathered. They couldn't ignore the whispers of a potentially volatile situation. The question, always, was whether the intentions behind the words were genuine or a ruse, a sociology experiment gone awry.\n\nHe thought back to the incident at school, where a student's Facebook page had been scrutinized, its contents deemed a cause for concern. The boundaries between private and public had been breached, and the consequences had been severe. The realization had struck him - the internet was a realm without borders, where the notion of privacy was a myth. If you didn't want your words to be seen, don't put them out there. If you didn't want someone to think a certain way, you couldn't control their thoughts. Schools, he believed, shouldn't befriend their students on social media platforms, shouldn't snoop through their online presence. But if concerns were raised, and the warning signs were heeded, the school had a duty to act. The line between monitoring and invasion of privacy was thin, but when danger loomed, it was a distinction that mattered little.\n\nHe'd learned to be mindful of his words, to consider the reach they might have. To think before posting, before sharing. The world, it seemed, was a fragile tapestry, where a single misstep could unravel the entire fabric. And in this vast and unforgiving expanse, he'd do well to remember the lesson of the voided spaces - that words, once spoken, could not be recalled, and their consequences, forever unbound.",
            "In the wasteland of reason, the war has been reduced to a hollow shell of its former purpose. What was once a crusade to restore democracy in a foreign land has devolved into a protracted exercise in futility. The original intent, to bring light to a land shrouded in tyranny, has been lost in the dust of time. The ghosts of George Bush's past animosities with Saddam Hussein still linger, casting a shadow over the true motivations behind the war.\n\nThe initial spark, a beacon of hope in the darkness, has flickered out, leaving behind a smoldering ember of justification. The war, once a clarion call to freedom, has become a Sisyphean task, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and despair. The first skirmishes, a decisive blow for democracy, have given way to a drawn-out stalemate, a war of attrition that has drained the lifeblood from our economy.\n\nWe were once driven by a noble purpose, a desire to liberate a people from the shackles of oppression. But that purpose has been eroded, worn down by the relentless tides of time. We have lost sight of the initial goal, and now we are mired in a quagmire of our own making. The war has become a self-perpetuating machine, a monster that feeds on our resources, our lives, and our very soul.\n\nThe cost is staggering, a drain on our economy that could be better spent on the pressing needs of our own people. The wars on poverty, education, and healthcare cry out for attention, but our treasure is squandered on a conflict that has long since lost its way. We are bleeding our treasury dry, sacrificing our own citizens on the altar of a cause that has been lost.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to a simple question: what is the true cost of our actions? Is it not time to acknowledge that the war has been a failure, a Pyrrhic victory that has achieved nothing but the perpetuation of a cycle of violence? We must confront the reality of our situation, and acknowledge that it is time to bring this sense of purpose to an end. The war has outlived its usefulness, and it is time to let it go.",
            "A question hung unspoken, like a thing of fragile glass suspended in the air, waiting to shatter. It had to do with the tracings of the past, the echoes of moments lived and lost, and the fragile boundaries of a person's private self. He recalled the words of an old man, a sage from a bygone era, who said that once a thing was placed upon the altar of the internet, it was as though it had been cast to the winds, subject to the whims of an unfeeling world. And so it was with Myspace, a digital realm where the veil of anonymity was but a thin membrane, easily pierced by the prying eyes of others.\n\nHe had heard the tale of a young soul, a wanderer in the digital wilderness, who had stumbled upon a profile, a digital shrine to a person's innermost thoughts and desires. And in that moment, a life was saved, a potential catastrophe averted. Yet, the boy's words hung in the air, a query that spoke to the very heart of the issue: was it right to expect that others would watch over us, to shield us from the dangers that lurked in the shadows of the net?\n\nHe thought of the boy's words, of the fragile balance between freedom and safety, between the desire for anonymity and the need for protection. It was a delicate dance, a precarious tightrope walked by those who ventured into the digital realm. And the consequences of a misstep? Ah, those were as uncertain as the wind that whipped through the dead trees, as ephemeral as the ashes that swirled in the breeze.\n\nIn the end, it was a question that begged for no easy answer, a riddle without a solution. For in the world of the internet, the lines between public and private were blurred, the boundaries between freedom and surveillance ever-shifting. And so, the boy's question hung in the air, a haunting reminder of the fragility of the human heart, and the uncertain future that lay ahead.",
            "The ghosts of war still linger in the ash-scarred landscape. The Iraq War, a calamity of unyielding proportions, continues to haunt us, a specter of hubris and miscalculation. To speak of it now feels like an exercise in futility, a vain attempt to grasp the ungraspable. And yet, I am drawn to the void, compelled to confront the ruin that we have wrought.\n\nLike a man wandering through a desolate landscape, I find myself torn between the weight of conviction and the crushing weight of doubt. I was against the war from the beginning, yet now it seems almost irrelevant, a fact lost in the din of history. The polls, a cacophony of numbers and opinions, scream in unison: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world, eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops, all concurring in their assessment: this war was a grave mistake.\n\nThe administration's recklessness, a product of its own myopia, blinds it to the inherent contradictions of its actions. The Middle East, a cauldron of ancient animosities and cultural fault lines, defies the simplistic notions of democracy and progress. The notion that we can impose our will upon this complex tapestry, that we can somehow \"bring democracy\" to a region where it has never taken root, is a conceit born of arrogance and ignorance.\n\nSaddam, a monstrous figure, may have been a bad man, but his ousting has unleashed a maelstrom of chaos, a quagmire from which we may never extricate ourselves. The administration's talking points, a jumble of half-truths and convenient fictions, fail to convince. The problems of withdrawal, they claim, are too dire, too complex. But I see no legitimate reason to stay. The voices of the Iraqis, the people we claim to be saving, cry out for our departure. Eighty percent, a staggering majority, demand our withdrawal within the year. And what of the quarter who urge us to leave now? Might they not know better than we, the would-be saviors, what is best for their own land?\n\nIf we leave, we can absolve ourselves of responsibility for the disaster that has unfolded. We can say, with a modicum of truth, that we were forced to withdraw by the will of the Iraqi people. But even this weak excuse will not suffice. We will never be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, not now, not ever. All we can hope for is to mitigate the damage, to leave with a semblance of dignity, rather than the ignominy of continued occupation.\n\nAnd so I ask: what now? How do we extricate ourselves from this festering wound? The answer, like the war itself, remains elusive, a mirage on the horizon of history. But one thing is certain: we must leave, and we must leave soon. The ghosts of war will not rest until we do.",
            "The air was heavy with the weight of unspoken truths, like the faint scent of rain on a dry earth. The fire of equality still smoldered, a flickering flame that danced with the wind of societal norms. I believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, a cancer that seeps into the marrow of our being. It is not a question of men and women alone, but rather the consequence of a culture that has been shaped by the past.\n\nIn the field of work, the glass ceiling still looms, a reminder that even with equality on the books, it is a struggle to shatter the silence of a legacy that reveres the status quo. Women, in particular, face a daunting task in piercing the veil of prejudice, for it is a world that has been crafted to favor the masculine. They strive to reach the pinnacle of success, only to find themselves hemmed in by the fragile glass that separates them from the upper echelons of power.\n\nBut it is not just women who face this trial. Men, too, are bound by the chains of societal expectation. Those who choose to stay at home, to nurture and care for their children, are met with skepticism and scorn, their masculinity called into question. The world looks upon them with a mixture of disdain and confusion, unable to comprehend the notion of a man who puts family above the altar of profit.\n\nIn the fashion industry, the stereotypes are even more pronounced. Men who dare to venture into this realm are often met with suspicion, their seriousness doubted, their passion questioned. They are seen as anomalies, outsiders who do not belong, their masculinity suspect because of their association with a world that is deemed feminine.\n\nBut change is a slow and tortuous process. It is a journey that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to challenge the status quo. We have come a long way, to be sure, but we still have far to go. The fight for equality is not a battle to be won overnight, but a marathon that demands our collective effort.\n\nPerhaps the key to progress lies not in forcing the issue, but in promoting the qualities that define us as individuals. By celebrating the strengths and weaknesses of those who are often stereotyped, we can begin to break down the walls that separate us. We must recognize that intelligence and worth are not solely the domain of the well-spoken, but rather the province of those who dare to be different.\n\nUltimately, the fight for equality is a journey that knows no bounds, a path that winds through the complexities of our collective experience. It is a road that is fraught with obstacles, but one that holds the promise of a brighter tomorrow. As we move forward, let us not forget that change is a gradual process, one that requires our collective effort and our unwavering commitment to the cause.\n\nIn the end, it is not just about men and women, but about the humanity that unites us all. It is about recognizing that we are all equal, that we are all deserving of respect and dignity, regardless of our background or our profession. And it is this understanding that will ultimately guide us toward a future where equality is not just a dream, but a reality.",
            "The understanding of the legal landscape is that they did not completely legalize it, but rather decriminalized it, stripping it of its former status as a felony charge. It is now akin to a traffic infraction, one that garners a citation rather than a full-blown arrest and prolonged court proceedings. Those who are caught are not burdened with the weight of a formal conviction, a concern that had previously hampered many who worried about the long-term implications on their future prospects, such as employment and social standing. Yet, there exists a counterargument that the fiscal burden of policing and prosecuting such offenses is considerable. The cost of apprehending, detaining, and processing individuals, only to release them later, can be a significant drain on municipal resources. Many financially strained municipalities hesitate to adopt such a measure, even if it would free up capital for more pressing needs.\n\nHowever, in places where public opinion leans more liberal, like Denver, decriminalization has become a matter of course. The resulting windfall of revenue has been redirected toward vital community programs, such as education, social services for the elderly, and feeding initiatives for those in need. It is a pragmatic approach that acknowledges the dual nature of this substance – its potential benefits and drawbacks. While its widespread availability might prove a concern, the financial and social implications of its prohibition cannot be ignored.\n\nOne of the lingering reservations about marijuana legalization pertains to its societal acceptance. Some worry that its widespread availability would undermine the cultural taboo surrounding it, leading to public use and, by extension, impaired driving. However, it is worth noting that alcohol, another substance with well-documented impairing effects, has yet to be fully eradicated from our society. Each substance has its unique impact on individuals, influenced by factors such as personality and life choices.\n\nModeration and self-control are key, as people's reactions to substances can vary significantly. It is challenging to generalize about the effects of marijuana, as individuals respond differently. Both alcohol and marijuana have negative consequences, and while some individuals can navigate these substances with ease, others may struggle. This nuanced understanding highlights the complexity of the issue, underscoring the importance of continued dialogue and informed decision-making.",
            "The notion of adhering to tradition is a weight that settles heavy upon the soul. Like the slow accumulation of ash on a weathered stone, the rituals and practices of a bygone era can suffocate the very life that seeks to breathe within them. The Catholic Church, an institution steeped in the rich soil of tradition, stands as a testament to this assertion. Its dogma, a labyrinth of doctrine and teaching, binds the faithful to a strict adherence to the ways of old.\n\nYet, like a river that refuses to be contained, change always seeks to seep into the cracks of the established order. The Church, too, has been shaped by the currents of time, its own waters churning with the disparate voices of its followers. The tension between tradition and adaptability is a chasm that yawns wide, threatening to swallow the very foundations of the institution.\n\nA passage of time, a span of years, a silence of decades – and the world shifts, ever so imperceptibly. The Church, too, must shift, or risk being consumed by the very traditions it seeks to uphold. And yet, like a tree that clings to its ancient roots, it resists the gentle tug of progress. The result is a disconnect, a schism that runs deep, a gulf that separates the teachings of the Church from the lived experience of its followers.\n\nConsider, if you will, the doctrine of love. \"Love thy neighbor as thyself,\" a teaching that echoes through the halls of scripture. And yet, the practice of the Church often seems to falter in its application of this very principle. The prohibition against marrying outside the faith, the rejection of those who do not conform to the established norms – these are but a few examples of the disconnect that exists between the teachings of the Church and the lived reality of its followers.\n\nThe issue of priestly marriage is a case in point. Some argue that allowing priests to wed would help to curb the scourge of pedophilia that has ravaged the Church. But is this not a simplistic solution, one that fails to address the deeper rot that festers within the institution? The abuse of power, the corruption of the sacred – these are not solved by the mere act of marriage. They require a fundamental shift in the way the Church views itself, a recognition that its teachings must be lived, not merely recited.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution that will save us, but the individuals who comprise it. It is not the tradition that will heal the wounds of the past, but the willingness to confront them head-on. As the world outside continues to shift and change, the Church must do the same, lest it be left behind, a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of a time when tradition was more important than the lives of its followers.",
            "A thing that weighs upon my mind, a matter that defies easy resolution. I find myself torn, suspended between the crevices of a dichotomy. The line separating church and state, a divide so fine it's nigh impossible to traverse. And the notion of marriage, a concept as slippery as a snake through the grass. It's a puzzle, a riddle, a thing that shifts and writhes like a living thing.\n\nI'm not one to take a stand, to stake my claim on a particular side of the fence. But I will say this: the boundaries between civil union and sacrament blur and blend like the hues of a sunset. Marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil contract to others. And what of the government's role in all this? Should it concern itself with the sanctity of the union, or merely the legalities? I think it should be the latter. The state's domain is one of law, not dogma.\n\nThe fact that gay marriage is a topic of debate at all speaks to the intractability of the issue. It's a tempest in a teapot, a storm that rages and churns but ultimately resolves into nothing. And yet, it's a tempest that refuses to dissipate, a maelstrom that draws in the unwary. The constitution, a document of grand import, is not a vessel for the whims of the masses. It's a framework, a structure that guides us, not a plaything for the passions of the day.\n\nTo amend the constitution for the sake of banning gay marriage is a notion that strikes me as... misguided. A constitutional amendment is a solemn thing, a weighty matter that should not be taken lightly. It's a decision that should be approached with caution, with trepidation. And yet, in this case, I fear it's a decision that's driven more by emotion than reason.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a home where the words of scripture held sway, where the teachings of the Lord were the guiding force behind every decision. Yet, as I've grown and navigated the complexities of the world, I've found myself drawn to the fringes of that faith, questioning the certainties I once held dear. The matter of homosexuality, in particular, has caused me to wrestle with the fine lines that separate conviction and compassion.\n\nI've had the privilege of forming friendships with individuals who walk a path I don't fully understand, and in doing so, I've come to see the humanity in their struggles. I don't pretend to comprehend the intricacies of their experiences, but I do know that they are not so different from my own. We are all seekers, stumbling through the darkness, searching for a glimmer of light.\n\nAs I've grappled with this issue, I've come to the realization that I don't share the same fervor as some of my contemporaries. I don't see the world in binary terms, where one choice is the only acceptable path. Instead, I believe that the complexities of human emotion and experience demand a more nuanced approach. I think that individuals should have the freedom to live their lives as they see fit, as long as they're not harming others.\n\nThe notion that our leaders should dictate how we live our private lives feels suffocating. The idea that one person's perspective should be imposed upon an entire nation strikes me as a recipe for division and strife. I believe that each state should have the autonomy to determine its own values and laws, rather than relying on a single individual to make decisions for the masses.\n\nIt's a matter of personal responsibility, of living with the consequences of our choices. If I choose to reside in a state that has chosen to legalize gay marriage, then I must respect their decision, even if it differs from my own. I don't believe it's my place to dictate how others live their lives, as long as they're not infringing upon my own rights.\n\nThe notion that a single leader, like President Bush, should have the authority to impose his will on the nation feels anachronistic. He doesn't live in every state; he doesn't bear the weight of every decision that affects the people of this land. His term in office is finite, and when it ends, the decision will ultimately rest with those who come after him.\n\nIn the end, it's up to each individual state to chart its own course, to navigate the complexities of human experience. It's a messy, imperfect process, but it's one that acknowledges the diversity of our nation and the autonomy of its people. I believe that's where true freedom lies – not in the dictates of a single leader, but in the choices we make as individuals, as communities, and as a nation.",
            "The world of the internet, a vast and unfettered expanse where the gaze of the public is unfettered. A bulletin board, a forum for the airing of one's thoughts and intentions, where the pixelated eyes of the world converge to witness the unfolding drama of the self. And yet, the notion of privacy, that fragile and tenuous thing, is lost in the ether like autumn leaves on a gusty day.\n\nThe school officials, those guardians of the academic halls, had every right to peer into the recesses of a student's digital life. For in the public realm, all is fair game. The internet, a labyrinth of interconnected threads, beckons the curious and the prurient alike to explore its depths. And those who venture there do so with the knowledge that their every move is being watched, their every thought laid bare for all to see.\n\nBut what of the school's responsibility to safeguard its charges? Is it not the duty of those who oversee the halls of learning to ensure the well-being of their pupils? To shield them from the dangers that lurk in the shadows of the digital world, where the past and present converge in a maelstrom of consequences. The Columbine incident, a dark and foreboding specter, haunts the dreams of educators, a reminder of the potential for violence that lurks in the hearts of the young.\n\nThe school officials, then, were merely doing their duty, seeking to avert the catastrophe that could have befallen upon them. By monitoring the online lives of their students, they acted to prevent the very thing they feared - the unleashing of chaos and destruction. And in this, they stood as the sentinels of a fragile and besieged institution, ever vigilant in their pursuit of a safer, more secure environment.\n\nBut what of the individual's right to privacy, that cherished and oft-abused notion? Does not the student's expectation of anonymity in the digital realm take precedence over the school's responsibility to safeguard its charges? The answer, much like the digital footprints we leave behind, is a fleeting and ephemeral thing, lost in the vast and uncaring expanse of the internet.\n\nIn the end, it is not the internet that is the problem, but rather our own expectations of it. We venture into this vast and unfettered expanse with the hope of connection, of community, and of expression. But we do so at the risk of being seen, of being watched, and of being judged. And it is in this tension that we find the crux of the matter - the delicate balance between the pursuit of self and the need for safety.",
            "A vast and desolate emptiness had settled within me, a chasm carved by the events of nine eleven. At first, I was a vessel for the fervor that swept the land, my heart afire with a desire for retribution. The wounds of that day still lingered, a festering sore that seemed to cry out for salve. I was convinced that invasion was the answer, that the imposition of our will would bring order to the chaos. But as the months passed, a creeping doubt began to take hold. We had charged into the fray without a clear plan, our hearts heavy with emotion and our minds clouded by anger. We spoke of liberation, but did we truly understand the complexities of the land we sought to shape?\n\nThe people we sought to free were a tapestry woven from many threads, threads that were often at odds with one another. They were a people prone to savagery, their wars a brutal and unyielding thing. And I began to wonder if we were merely pawns in their game, if our presence was little more than a catalyst for their own internecine conflicts. The more I considered it, the more I came to believe that our intervention had been a mistake, a folly born of passion rather than prudence. We had attempted to impose our will upon a people who would not be swayed, who would not be changed. And in the end, it was we who were the ones who were changed, our hearts hardened by the experience.\n\nI often think of my uncle's words, spoken on a long-ago day by the lake's edge. He had taught me that the world was a complex and multifaceted thing, that its workings were not always easy to understand. And I began to see that our actions in that far-off land had been a testament to our own ignorance, our own arrogance. We had charged in with guns blazing, convinced of our own righteousness, but in the end, it was we who were left with the wounds.\n\nI do not know what the future holds, but I do know that our presence in that land has been a futile endeavor. We have made progress, to be sure, but it is progress that will not last. The land will continue to be a battleground, a place of bloodshed and strife. And we will be the ones who are left to pick up the pieces, to wonder why we had thought we could change the course of history. It is a lesson I will carry with me for the rest of my days, a reminder of the futility of our endeavors, and the dangers of acting without thought or foresight."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The once-venerable institution of the Catholic Church stands at a crossroads, its waning influence a symptom of a broader malaise. A disconnect between the Church's stance on certain issues and the evolving values of its adherents has precipitated a decline in devotion. The Church's dogmatic views on matters like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, though well-intentioned, have grown archaic in their rigidity. By failing to adapt to the shifting tides of modernity, the Church risks losing its flock to a younger generation that demands a more inclusive and compassionate understanding.\n\nA Church that clings to an outdated worldview risks alienating those who would otherwise seek solace in its teachings. The specter of judgment and intolerance that hangs over certain issues drives away the very souls it seeks to nurture. In an era where the boundaries of acceptance are expanding, the Church's inflexibility appears as a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe prohibition on female priests and married clergy only serves to further exacerbate the disconnect. In an age where women hold positions of power and authority in nearly every sphere, the notion that they are somehow less suited to the priesthood seems anachronistic. And yet, despite this, the Church remains adamant in its stance. The consequences of this rigidity are evident in the dwindling numbers of adherents who feel unwelcome in a community that refuses to evolve.\n\nBut would even the relaxation of these rules have altered the course of events? It is impossible to know, and perhaps it is hubris to assume that such concessions would have been enough to prevent the exodus of devotees. The wounds run too deep, and the wounds of history cannot be so easily healed.\n\nAnd yet, it is precisely this inflexibility that raises the question: why must priests be unmarried? The Church's assertion that they are wedded to God is laudable, but it is a notion that rings hollow when set against the lived experience of those who have dedicated their lives to other pursuits. Why must the clergy be singled out for a life of solitary devotion? In a world where men and women must navigate the complexities of family and career, why must priests be exempt from these same challenges?\n\nIt is a question that speaks to the very heart of the Church's identity. Does it truly believe that its adherents are bound to a higher calling, one that supersedes the demands of the flesh? Or does it merely cling to a tradition that has outlived its purpose? The answer to this question will determine the course of the Church's future, and whether it will find a way to reclaim its relevance in a world that is rapidly leaving it behind.",
            "The existence of two souls bound in love is not a choice. It is an unyielding condition, an inescapable truth that defies the strictures of societal norms. I do not pretend to be an authority on the matter, but I do know this: that the manner in which one is born is not a decision, but a fate. We are each born with a certain inclination, a certain affinity, a certain unshakeable sense of self. The choice, if it can be called that, lies not in the heart's allegiance, but in the world's acceptance.\n\nTo deny two souls the right to consecrate their love, to bind themselves in matrimony, is to deny the inherent dignity of their existence. It is to imply that their love is somehow aberrant, somehow less authentic than the love between two souls of opposite sexes. I do not believe this to be the case. I believe that love knows no bounds, no distinctions, no limitations. It is a force that transcends the petty constraints of human convention.\n\nThe federal government, with its erstwhile authority, should not interfere in the private lives of its citizens. The issue of same-sex marriage is not a matter of national security, nor is it a question of moral rectitude. It is a question of basic human rights, of the freedom to love without fear of reprisal or persecution. The government should not seek to impose its will upon those who would seek to love as they are. It should not seek to dictate the terms of their existence.\n\nUltimately, the question of same-sex marriage is a simple one: should we not allow two souls to love as they are, to bind themselves together in the bond of matrimony, free from the constraints of societal expectation? I believe that we should. The world may view their love as aberrant, but I do not. I see it for what it is: a testament to the human spirit, a testament to the enduring power of love in all its forms.",
            "In the desolate expanse of our society, a fundamental question lingers, a specter that haunts the fringes of our collective conscience: the legalization of gay marriage. The wind howls through the barren lands, whipping up dust devils of ignorance and prejudice, as we stumble through the wasteland of our moral ambiguities.\n\nIt is a notion that has long been shrouded in an impenetrable haze, a mystery waiting to be unraveled. Many claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, a notion that is as baseless as the ash that blankets the earth. For what is a family, truly? Is it not two souls bound together by love and commitment, regardless of the intricacies of their relationship? Is it not a bond that transcends the petty squabbles of society, a union that speaks to the very essence of human connection?\n\nBut the proponents of this antiquated view cling to their biases, their arguments as hollow as the shells of the wind-blasted trees that line our roads. They claim that gay couples are somehow less worthy of recognition, that their love is an aberration, a deviation from the norm. But what is normal, truly? Is it not the pursuit of happiness, the yearning for connection that defines us as human beings? And is not love the very fabric that weaves our lives together?\n\nThe statistics are clear: gay couples exhibit the same rates of success, the same factors contributing to satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts. They are not asking for the right to wed in a church, but for a simple marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the very government that claims to represent us all. Why, then, must we deny them this fundamental right? Is it not a matter of fairness, of equality? Or are we content to live in a society where some are more equal than others?\n\nThe segregation of separate but unequal is a hollow argument, a feeble attempt to justify the injustices that we inflict upon one another. We speak of morality, of the teachings of our churches, but do we not risk hypocrisy when we allow our personal beliefs to dictate the laws of our land? Can we truly claim to be a just society when we deny the rights of a segment of our population simply because of their sexual orientation?\n\nAnd what of the children, those precious innocents who are caught in the crossfire of our prejudices? Do we not risk inflicting upon them a lifetime of pain and suffering by denying their parents the rights and privileges that we take for granted? The American Psychological Association has spoken, and their words are clear: the claims of psychological damage are unfounded, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nAs we stumble through this desolate landscape, we would do well to remember that our opinions are not the only ones that matter. We would do well to listen to the institutions that have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge, to the research and studies that have shed light on this issue. For in the end, it is not our personal biases that will decide the fate of gay marriage, but our collective willingness to recognize the inherent value of every human being.\n\nLet us not be swayed by the winds of ignorance, but rather by the gentle breeze of compassion and understanding. Let us walk the narrow path of justice, and let us ensure that our society is a place where love knows no bounds, where every individual is treated with dignity and respect. For in the end, it is not the laws that we make, but the hearts that we hold that truly define us as human beings.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy, where the fluorescent lights hum a monotonous dirge, I toil in the sweltering summer months. The smell of antiseptic wafts through the air, a constant reminder of the fragility of life. Yet, amidst this sterile backdrop, I find myself pondering the oft-maligned subject of illicit substances. \n\nJust as the law's restrictive grasp cannot deny the medicinal virtues of certain controlled substances, such as oxycodone or Vicodin, so too must we not dismiss the potential benefits of cannabis. The notion that a drug's illegality somehow negates its utility is a fallacy, a product of societal taboo rather than scientific fact. \n\nAs a pharmacy technician, I've witnessed firsthand the responsible use of prohibited substances in medical contexts. Why, then, do we not extend the same consideration to marijuana? The parallels between the two, though imperfect, are striking. Like alcohol, marijuana's abuse can lead to deleterious consequences; yet, just as we do not outlaw the latter, we should not hastily condemn the former. \n\nPerhaps the key lies in a gradual, measured approach, rather than an abrupt shift in policy. By first dismantling the stigmatized image surrounding marijuana, we may foster a more responsible attitude towards its use. The vilification of this substance has created a misconception, one that obscures its potential therapeutic benefits. By acknowledging these advantages, we may yet unlock a new frontier in medicine. \n\nBut alas, the ingrained prejudices run deep. The specter of heroin and cocaine looms large, casting a dark shadow over marijuana's reputation. It is a stubborn stain, one that requires time, patience, and a willingness to reexamine our assumptions. Only then can we hope to transcend the haze of misconception and unlock the truth behind this oft-maligned substance.",
            "In a world that has shed its staidness, the church has undergone a metamorphosis, adapting to the twenty-first century with a newfound flexibility. No longer a bastion of rigidity, it has begun to shed the strictures of its former self, its once-imposing façade now worn and weathered by the whispers of time.\n\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I am reminded of the church as it was in my youth – a place of solemnity and reverence, where the air was thick with the scent of sanctity and the rustle of starched fabric. Every Sunday, I donned my Sunday best – a demure dress, matching shoes, and a purse to match – and joined my friends at the private school I attended on weekends. The ritual was a comforting one, a sense of predictability that anchored me in a world that seemed to be spinning ever more rapidly.\n\nBut as I grew older, I noticed a subtle yet profound change. The church, once a bastion of tradition, began to succumb to the zeitgeist of a more casual era. The teenage mass, a innovation that sought to engage the younger generation, was a telling sign of the times. Services were now neatly condensed into thirty minutes, a fleeting snapshot of devotion in an increasingly harried world. The once-formal attire gave way to a more relaxed, even casual, dress code. Summer Sundays saw beachwear creeping into the pews, a testament to the church's willingness to adapt.\n\nAs I observe this shift, I am struck by the essence of the institution. The church, like the world around it, is a reflection of humanity's evolving values. It is a place where tradition and innovation coexist, where the sacred and the mundane intersect. And yet, despite this adaptability, the church remains a cipher, an enigma that continues to elude my understanding.\n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I am reminded of the complexity of human nature. The notion that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these atrocities is a simplistic one. Pedophilia, I believe, is a product of genetics, a deeply ingrained aspect of an individual's makeup. It is not a choice, a vice that can be eradicated through marriage or any other means. The church, like any institution, is a reflection of humanity at its worst and best. While it is true that some priests have been accused of abuse, it is also true that many have dedicated their lives to selfless service.\n\nThe example of Seventh Heaven, a denomination that allows its ministers to marry, serves as a counterpoint to the Catholic Church's stance. Yet, it also highlights the individual's choice to pursue a particular faith or vocation. If an individual's desires are at odds with the requirements of their faith, perhaps it is time to reevaluate their commitment.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers. The Catholic Church, like the world around it, is a tapestry of contradictions – a place of beauty and ugliness, of light and darkness. Its evolution is a reflection of humanity's own, a slow and halting process that grapples with the complexities of existence.",
            "The ashes of the century still lingered, a cold and festering wound that refused to heal. The echoes of a calamitous day still lingered, a hollowed-out refrain that seemed to seep into every pore. The wounds of September's brutal birth pangs still bled, a festering sore that had yet to scab. The nation's collective psyche remained a maelstrom of anger, a churning sea of discontent that threatened to engulf all in its path. The winds of war had been fanned by the whispers of a pretext, a thin veil of deceit that had been woven to conceal the true intent of those who held the reins.\n\nThe Bush administration, a cabal of men driven by a zealot's fervor, had set the nation ablaze with a war of choice, a conflict born of hubris and a desire for dominance. The lies had been legion, a litany of half-truths and outright fabrications that had been peddled to the public with a zeal that bordered on the fanatical. The notion that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to the nation's security, that he harbored weapons of mass destruction, was a myth, a chimera conjured by the fevered imagination of those who would seek to justify their actions.\n\nAnd yet, even now, the wounds ran deep, a festering sore that refused to heal. The Constitution, that sacred document that had been the cornerstone of the nation's foundation, had been trampled, its principles and ideals cast aside like so much rubbish. The disregard for the rule of law, the flaunting of power, had become a hallmark of the administration, a litany of abuses that had been perpetrated with impunity.\n\nAs the nation teetered on the brink of collapse, the question remained: what had been the true intention of the war? Was it a quest for oil, a desire to secure the nation's energy needs, or was it something more sinister, a bid for dominance in a world that was rapidly changing? The answer, much like the truth, remained shrouded in mystery, a enigma that refused to yield to the probing of reason.\n\nThe situation in Iraq, a quagmire of chaos and confusion, seemed to be spiraling out of control. The interim government, a fragile entity, teetered on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty threatened by the very nations that sought to prop it up. The Parliament, a body supposedly empowered to govern, was a mere shell of its former self, a hollow vessel devoid of purpose or direction. The radicals, a cauldron of dissent and discontent, simmered just below the surface, waiting to boil over and engulf all in their path.\n\nAnd yet, even in the midst of this maelstrom, a glimmer of hope remained. A coalition of nations, a patchwork of interests and ideologies, sought to impose order on the chaos, to bring a modicum of stability to a nation on the brink of collapse. But would it be enough? Or would the very attempts to impose order only serve to exacerbate the problem, to sow the seeds of discord and strife that would ultimately lead to a bitter harvest of blood and tears?\n\nOnly time would tell, but one thing was certain: the wounds of the past would not easily heal, and the future, like the present, remained shrouded in uncertainty, a dark and foreboding mist that threatened to engulf all in its path.",
            "He spoke in hushed tones, his words lost in the haze of indecision.  I'm not sure where to begin, he said, the words like ashes on his tongue.  The War in Iraq, a thing that had consumed the air, the news, the very fabric of life.  He thought of it as a beast, a thing that gnawed at the edges of the world, leaving only ruin in its wake.\n\nIt was a war that had never been declared, a shadowy thing that lurched forward with a hunger for power and for oil.  They had gone in with guns and bombs, with a promise of democracy and freedom.  But it had become a thing of ash and dust, a desolate landscape of burned cities and shattered lives.\n\nHe thought of the families, the sons and daughters who had gone to fight, leaving behind the warmth of home and the comfort of loved ones.  Their faces etched in his mind like the faces of the dead.  The ones who had come back, their eyes haunted, their hearts heavy with the weight of what they had seen.\n\nHe thought of the people of Iraq, their culture shattered, their lives torn apart by the very forces that had come to help.  The Al-Kaida, a hydra-like thing that seemed to grow stronger with each passing day.  Their hatred for the United States a thing that deepened with each passing moment.\n\nHe didn't know what to think, what to feel.  It was a morass of conflicting emotions, a tangle of threads that he couldn't seem to untangle.  He felt a sense of responsibility, a sense of duty to the boys and girls who had gone to fight.  But he also felt a sense of shame, a sense of guilt for the lives that had been lost, the lives that had been torn apart.\n\nThe words tumbled out of him like a confession, a prayer, a plea for understanding.  It was a war that had become a thing of ash and dust, a desolate landscape of burned cities and shattered lives.  He didn't know if it was worth it, if the cost had been worth the gain.  All he knew was that it was a thing that would haunt him, a thing that would stay with him for the rest of his days.\n\nThe words trailed off, lost in the silence.  He was left with only questions, only doubts.  The War in Iraq, a thing that had consumed the air, the news, the very fabric of life.  A thing that would haunt him, a thing that would stay with him forever.",
            "The notion of imposing a law, a declaration of what is permissible or not, strikes a discordant note within me. It is a notion that borders on the hubris of those who would seek to impose their will upon the realm of the sacred, of the churches, where faith and conviction hold sway. The constitution, that enduring testament to the principles of our nation, speaks of the separation of church and state, a clear and unmistakable demarcation between the realms of the temporal and the eternal. To tamper with this balance would be to invite chaos, to upset the delicate equipoise that has been established.\n\nThe churches, not the government, are the proper arbiters of such matters. It is they who have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of the divine, who have walked the hallowed paths of faith for centuries. The government, with its pretensions to omniscience, should not usurp the authority of the churches. To do so would be to elevate the mundane over the sacred, to confuse the roles of the temporal and the eternal.\n\nThe notion of an amendment, of a law imposed by the hand of the state, would be a perversion of the principles that our constitution enshrines. It would be a restriction, not of the government, but of the people, a stifling of their freedom to worship, to believe as they see fit. And for what purpose? To impose the will of one church, one creed, upon the many? It is a notion devoid of merit, a relic of a outdated thinking that would seek to impose a narrow, dogmatic view upon a pluralistic society.\n\nI do not see the rationale behind such an amendment, save for the personal convictions of a few. The president's actions, in pushing for such a law, smack of a disregard for the separation of church and state, a willingness to impose his own views upon the nation, in direct contravention of the principles enshrined in our constitution. It is a step down a perilous path, one that would lead us further down the road of intolerance, of restriction, of the stifling of individual freedom.\n\nIn truth, I see little reason for such an amendment. It would do little to improve our economy, our society, our lives. In fact, it might have a negative impact, stifling the very freedoms that our nation was founded upon. The government should not be involved in this issue, should not seek to impose its will upon the churches. The people, in their diversity, should be free to worship as they see fit, to follow the dictates of their hearts, not the edicts of the state.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should not be involved in this matter. The churches, not the government, should be the arbiters of such issues. The constitution, that sacred document, speaks clearly and unequivocally on this matter. Let us not forget its words, let us not forget the principles that have guided us thus far. Let us preserve the separation of church and state, and allow the people to worship as they see fit, free from the interference of the state.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict born of deceit and hubris. It was a war that began as a shroud of secrecy, a tangled web of half-truths and misdirection. The government's justifications, a whispered litany of lies, designed to stir the passions of the American people, to cloak the invasion in a mantle of righteousness. The echoes of September 11th, a distant memory, a false pretext for the blood-soaked sands of Mesopotamia. The drums of war beat out a rhythm of fear and anger, a siren's song that lured the nation into the abyss.\n\nWe were a people, lost and searching, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own self-importance. We were told that the Iraqi government was a monster, a grotesque and malevolent force that threatened our very way of life. But was it not a lie? Were we not being deceived, led astray by the insidious whisperings of our own leaders? The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a cautionary tale of a war that had been lost, a war that had claimed the lives of countless young men, a war that had left a nation scarred and bitter.\n\nAnd yet, we walked into the void, blind and unprepared, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own arrogance. We removed the government, leaving a power vacuum, a chasm of chaos that would swallow us whole. The aftermath, a nightmarish tapestry of blood and fire, a litany of death and despair. The insurgency, a hydra-headed beast, a creature that would not be slain. We fought the citizens, the very people we claimed to liberate, and we were defeated.\n\nWe were not prepared for the consequences of our actions, nor did we understand the nature of the enemy we faced. We were naive, blinded by our own righteousness, our own self-importance. We were not fighting an army, but a people, a people who refused to be subjugated, a people who would not be silenced. The war in Iraq, a repeat of the mistakes of the past, a war that would haunt us for generations to come.\n\nWe are still there, mired in the quagmire, our casualties mounting, our dreams of a free and democratic Iraq slipping further and further away. The oil, a siren's song, a lure that beckoned us to the abyss. The true reasons for the war, shrouded in secrecy, hidden from the prying eyes of the public. The lies, the half-truths, the misdirection, a cleverly woven tapestry of deceit.\n\nAnd so we are stuck, trapped in a cycle of violence and fear, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own hubris. We are a people, lost and searching, our way forward shrouded in uncertainty. The war in Iraq, a dark and foreboding presence, a shadow that looms over our collective conscience. We can only hope that it will end soon, that the bloodshed will cease, and that peace will return to that troubled land.",
            "The thought stirs like a flame in the dark, a flickering thing that refuses to be extinguished. I am drawn to it, this notion of love without bounds, of two souls entwined in a dance of devotion. It is a notion that has long been a part of me, a whispered promise to myself, a gentle urging to break free from the constraints of a world that seeks to define us by the whims of others.\n\nIn the stillness of night, when the world is hushed and the shadows reign, I am reminded of the fragility of life, the ephemeral nature of our existence. And yet, in this fleeting moment, I find solace in the knowledge that love knows no bounds, that it can transcend the confines of societal expectations, of familial norms, of ancient traditions. It is a love that is raw, unbridled, and unapologetic, a love that refuses to be silenced by the whispers of doubt and fear.\n\nI have always believed that love is a fundamental right, a basic human necessity that should be granted to all, regardless of the labels we assign to it. It is a right that should be protected, cherished, and upheld, not denied or diminished by the arrogance of those who would seek to impose their will upon others. For love is not a choice, it is a calling, a primal urge that cannot be tamed or controlled.\n\nIn this bleak and barren world, where the winds howl and the ash falls like a shroud, I find hope in the resilience of the human spirit. I see it in the way two people, bound by love, can weather the storms, can face the darkness, and can emerge stronger, more steadfast, and more unbreakable. It is a love that is forged in the fire of adversity, tempered by the trials of a world that seeks to tear us apart.\n\nAnd so, I stand steadfast in my conviction, unwavering in my resolve. I believe that love knows no bounds, that it is a fundamental right, a basic human necessity that should be upheld and cherished. I believe that love is a flame that burns bright, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of it. And I believe that it is a love that should be free to flourish, unencumbered by the constraints of societal expectations, unshackled by the chains of oppression.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the laws that govern us, nor the politics that divide us, nor the norms that constrain us, that truly matter. It is the love that we share, the love that we give, and the love that we receive. It is the love that burns within us, a flame that flickers brightly, a light that shines brightly in the darkness.",
            "He'd learned the lesson of the voided spaces where words reside. Where thoughts without borders spread like ash on the wind. When something was placed in the public expanse, it lost all vestige of sanctuary. It became a thing without bounds, a thing that could not be recalled. A thing that would forever bear the weight of perception. As an RA, he'd witnessed it firsthand - the careless utterances, the misplaced words that could spark a fire. The bulletin that arrived at the school, its origin unknown, a harbinger of dread. The friends who'd stumbled upon it, their faces etched with concern. The search for the source, the parsing of intent. The line between jest and gravity, forever blurred.\n\nThe internet, a vast and unforgiving plain, where words were currency and reputation was the cost. No refuge from the gaze of the many, where the private was an illusion. When you entered the public sphere, you surrendered to the whims of others. You couldn't dictate how they'd receive your words, or what they'd make of them. The school officials, bound by duty, had to act on the information they gathered. They couldn't ignore the whispers of a potentially volatile situation. The question, always, was whether the intentions behind the words were genuine or a ruse, a sociology experiment gone awry.\n\nHe thought back to the incident at school, where a student's Facebook page had been scrutinized, its contents deemed a cause for concern. The boundaries between private and public had been breached, and the consequences had been severe. The realization had struck him - the internet was a realm without borders, where the notion of privacy was a myth. If you didn't want your words to be seen, don't put them out there. If you didn't want someone to think a certain way, you couldn't control their thoughts. Schools, he believed, shouldn't befriend their students on social media platforms, shouldn't snoop through their online presence. But if concerns were raised, and the warning signs were heeded, the school had a duty to act. The line between monitoring and invasion of privacy was thin, but when danger loomed, it was a distinction that mattered little.\n\nHe'd learned to be mindful of his words, to consider the reach they might have. To think before posting, before sharing. The world, it seemed, was a fragile tapestry, where a single misstep could unravel the entire fabric. And in this vast and unforgiving expanse, he'd do well to remember the lesson of the voided spaces - that words, once spoken, could not be recalled, and their consequences, forever unbound.",
            "In the wasteland of reason, the war has been reduced to a hollow shell of its former purpose. What was once a crusade to restore democracy in a foreign land has devolved into a protracted exercise in futility. The original intent, to bring light to a land shrouded in tyranny, has been lost in the dust of time. The ghosts of George Bush's past animosities with Saddam Hussein still linger, casting a shadow over the true motivations behind the war.\n\nThe initial spark, a beacon of hope in the darkness, has flickered out, leaving behind a smoldering ember of justification. The war, once a clarion call to freedom, has become a Sisyphean task, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and despair. The first skirmishes, a decisive blow for democracy, have given way to a drawn-out stalemate, a war of attrition that has drained the lifeblood from our economy.\n\nWe were once driven by a noble purpose, a desire to liberate a people from the shackles of oppression. But that purpose has been eroded, worn down by the relentless tides of time. We have lost sight of the initial goal, and now we are mired in a quagmire of our own making. The war has become a self-perpetuating machine, a monster that feeds on our resources, our lives, and our very soul.\n\nThe cost is staggering, a drain on our economy that could be better spent on the pressing needs of our own people. The wars on poverty, education, and healthcare cry out for attention, but our treasure is squandered on a conflict that has long since lost its way. We are bleeding our treasury dry, sacrificing our own citizens on the altar of a cause that has been lost.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to a simple question: what is the true cost of our actions? Is it not time to acknowledge that the war has been a failure, a Pyrrhic victory that has achieved nothing but the perpetuation of a cycle of violence? We must confront the reality of our situation, and acknowledge that it is time to bring this sense of purpose to an end. The war has outlived its usefulness, and it is time to let it go.",
            "A question hung unspoken, like a thing of fragile glass suspended in the air, waiting to shatter. It had to do with the tracings of the past, the echoes of moments lived and lost, and the fragile boundaries of a person's private self. He recalled the words of an old man, a sage from a bygone era, who said that once a thing was placed upon the altar of the internet, it was as though it had been cast to the winds, subject to the whims of an unfeeling world. And so it was with Myspace, a digital realm where the veil of anonymity was but a thin membrane, easily pierced by the prying eyes of others.\n\nHe had heard the tale of a young soul, a wanderer in the digital wilderness, who had stumbled upon a profile, a digital shrine to a person's innermost thoughts and desires. And in that moment, a life was saved, a potential catastrophe averted. Yet, the boy's words hung in the air, a query that spoke to the very heart of the issue: was it right to expect that others would watch over us, to shield us from the dangers that lurked in the shadows of the net?\n\nHe thought of the boy's words, of the fragile balance between freedom and safety, between the desire for anonymity and the need for protection. It was a delicate dance, a precarious tightrope walked by those who ventured into the digital realm. And the consequences of a misstep? Ah, those were as uncertain as the wind that whipped through the dead trees, as ephemeral as the ashes that swirled in the breeze.\n\nIn the end, it was a question that begged for no easy answer, a riddle without a solution. For in the world of the internet, the lines between public and private were blurred, the boundaries between freedom and surveillance ever-shifting. And so, the boy's question hung in the air, a haunting reminder of the fragility of the human heart, and the uncertain future that lay ahead.",
            "The ghosts of war still linger in the ash-scarred landscape. The Iraq War, a calamity of unyielding proportions, continues to haunt us, a specter of hubris and miscalculation. To speak of it now feels like an exercise in futility, a vain attempt to grasp the ungraspable. And yet, I am drawn to the void, compelled to confront the ruin that we have wrought.\n\nLike a man wandering through a desolate landscape, I find myself torn between the weight of conviction and the crushing weight of doubt. I was against the war from the beginning, yet now it seems almost irrelevant, a fact lost in the din of history. The polls, a cacophony of numbers and opinions, scream in unison: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world, eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops, all concurring in their assessment: this war was a grave mistake.\n\nThe administration's recklessness, a product of its own myopia, blinds it to the inherent contradictions of its actions. The Middle East, a cauldron of ancient animosities and cultural fault lines, defies the simplistic notions of democracy and progress. The notion that we can impose our will upon this complex tapestry, that we can somehow \"bring democracy\" to a region where it has never taken root, is a conceit born of arrogance and ignorance.\n\nSaddam, a monstrous figure, may have been a bad man, but his ousting has unleashed a maelstrom of chaos, a quagmire from which we may never extricate ourselves. The administration's talking points, a jumble of half-truths and convenient fictions, fail to convince. The problems of withdrawal, they claim, are too dire, too complex. But I see no legitimate reason to stay. The voices of the Iraqis, the people we claim to be saving, cry out for our departure. Eighty percent, a staggering majority, demand our withdrawal within the year. And what of the quarter who urge us to leave now? Might they not know better than we, the would-be saviors, what is best for their own land?\n\nIf we leave, we can absolve ourselves of responsibility for the disaster that has unfolded. We can say, with a modicum of truth, that we were forced to withdraw by the will of the Iraqi people. But even this weak excuse will not suffice. We will never be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, not now, not ever. All we can hope for is to mitigate the damage, to leave with a semblance of dignity, rather than the ignominy of continued occupation.\n\nAnd so I ask: what now? How do we extricate ourselves from this festering wound? The answer, like the war itself, remains elusive, a mirage on the horizon of history. But one thing is certain: we must leave, and we must leave soon. The ghosts of war will not rest until we do.",
            "The air was heavy with the weight of unspoken truths, like the faint scent of rain on a dry earth. The fire of equality still smoldered, a flickering flame that danced with the wind of societal norms. I believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, a cancer that seeps into the marrow of our being. It is not a question of men and women alone, but rather the consequence of a culture that has been shaped by the past.\n\nIn the field of work, the glass ceiling still looms, a reminder that even with equality on the books, it is a struggle to shatter the silence of a legacy that reveres the status quo. Women, in particular, face a daunting task in piercing the veil of prejudice, for it is a world that has been crafted to favor the masculine. They strive to reach the pinnacle of success, only to find themselves hemmed in by the fragile glass that separates them from the upper echelons of power.\n\nBut it is not just women who face this trial. Men, too, are bound by the chains of societal expectation. Those who choose to stay at home, to nurture and care for their children, are met with skepticism and scorn, their masculinity called into question. The world looks upon them with a mixture of disdain and confusion, unable to comprehend the notion of a man who puts family above the altar of profit.\n\nIn the fashion industry, the stereotypes are even more pronounced. Men who dare to venture into this realm are often met with suspicion, their seriousness doubted, their passion questioned. They are seen as anomalies, outsiders who do not belong, their masculinity suspect because of their association with a world that is deemed feminine.\n\nBut change is a slow and tortuous process. It is a journey that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to challenge the status quo. We have come a long way, to be sure, but we still have far to go. The fight for equality is not a battle to be won overnight, but a marathon that demands our collective effort.\n\nPerhaps the key to progress lies not in forcing the issue, but in promoting the qualities that define us as individuals. By celebrating the strengths and weaknesses of those who are often stereotyped, we can begin to break down the walls that separate us. We must recognize that intelligence and worth are not solely the domain of the well-spoken, but rather the province of those who dare to be different.\n\nUltimately, the fight for equality is a journey that knows no bounds, a path that winds through the complexities of our collective experience. It is a road that is fraught with obstacles, but one that holds the promise of a brighter tomorrow. As we move forward, let us not forget that change is a gradual process, one that requires our collective effort and our unwavering commitment to the cause.\n\nIn the end, it is not just about men and women, but about the humanity that unites us all. It is about recognizing that we are all equal, that we are all deserving of respect and dignity, regardless of our background or our profession. And it is this understanding that will ultimately guide us toward a future where equality is not just a dream, but a reality.",
            "The understanding of the legal landscape is that they did not completely legalize it, but rather decriminalized it, stripping it of its former status as a felony charge. It is now akin to a traffic infraction, one that garners a citation rather than a full-blown arrest and prolonged court proceedings. Those who are caught are not burdened with the weight of a formal conviction, a concern that had previously hampered many who worried about the long-term implications on their future prospects, such as employment and social standing. Yet, there exists a counterargument that the fiscal burden of policing and prosecuting such offenses is considerable. The cost of apprehending, detaining, and processing individuals, only to release them later, can be a significant drain on municipal resources. Many financially strained municipalities hesitate to adopt such a measure, even if it would free up capital for more pressing needs.\n\nHowever, in places where public opinion leans more liberal, like Denver, decriminalization has become a matter of course. The resulting windfall of revenue has been redirected toward vital community programs, such as education, social services for the elderly, and feeding initiatives for those in need. It is a pragmatic approach that acknowledges the dual nature of this substance – its potential benefits and drawbacks. While its widespread availability might prove a concern, the financial and social implications of its prohibition cannot be ignored.\n\nOne of the lingering reservations about marijuana legalization pertains to its societal acceptance. Some worry that its widespread availability would undermine the cultural taboo surrounding it, leading to public use and, by extension, impaired driving. However, it is worth noting that alcohol, another substance with well-documented impairing effects, has yet to be fully eradicated from our society. Each substance has its unique impact on individuals, influenced by factors such as personality and life choices.\n\nModeration and self-control are key, as people's reactions to substances can vary significantly. It is challenging to generalize about the effects of marijuana, as individuals respond differently. Both alcohol and marijuana have negative consequences, and while some individuals can navigate these substances with ease, others may struggle. This nuanced understanding highlights the complexity of the issue, underscoring the importance of continued dialogue and informed decision-making.",
            "The notion of adhering to tradition is a weight that settles heavy upon the soul. Like the slow accumulation of ash on a weathered stone, the rituals and practices of a bygone era can suffocate the very life that seeks to breathe within them. The Catholic Church, an institution steeped in the rich soil of tradition, stands as a testament to this assertion. Its dogma, a labyrinth of doctrine and teaching, binds the faithful to a strict adherence to the ways of old.\n\nYet, like a river that refuses to be contained, change always seeks to seep into the cracks of the established order. The Church, too, has been shaped by the currents of time, its own waters churning with the disparate voices of its followers. The tension between tradition and adaptability is a chasm that yawns wide, threatening to swallow the very foundations of the institution.\n\nA passage of time, a span of years, a silence of decades – and the world shifts, ever so imperceptibly. The Church, too, must shift, or risk being consumed by the very traditions it seeks to uphold. And yet, like a tree that clings to its ancient roots, it resists the gentle tug of progress. The result is a disconnect, a schism that runs deep, a gulf that separates the teachings of the Church from the lived experience of its followers.\n\nConsider, if you will, the doctrine of love. \"Love thy neighbor as thyself,\" a teaching that echoes through the halls of scripture. And yet, the practice of the Church often seems to falter in its application of this very principle. The prohibition against marrying outside the faith, the rejection of those who do not conform to the established norms – these are but a few examples of the disconnect that exists between the teachings of the Church and the lived reality of its followers.\n\nThe issue of priestly marriage is a case in point. Some argue that allowing priests to wed would help to curb the scourge of pedophilia that has ravaged the Church. But is this not a simplistic solution, one that fails to address the deeper rot that festers within the institution? The abuse of power, the corruption of the sacred – these are not solved by the mere act of marriage. They require a fundamental shift in the way the Church views itself, a recognition that its teachings must be lived, not merely recited.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution that will save us, but the individuals who comprise it. It is not the tradition that will heal the wounds of the past, but the willingness to confront them head-on. As the world outside continues to shift and change, the Church must do the same, lest it be left behind, a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of a time when tradition was more important than the lives of its followers.",
            "A thing that weighs upon my mind, a matter that defies easy resolution. I find myself torn, suspended between the crevices of a dichotomy. The line separating church and state, a divide so fine it's nigh impossible to traverse. And the notion of marriage, a concept as slippery as a snake through the grass. It's a puzzle, a riddle, a thing that shifts and writhes like a living thing.\n\nI'm not one to take a stand, to stake my claim on a particular side of the fence. But I will say this: the boundaries between civil union and sacrament blur and blend like the hues of a sunset. Marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil contract to others. And what of the government's role in all this? Should it concern itself with the sanctity of the union, or merely the legalities? I think it should be the latter. The state's domain is one of law, not dogma.\n\nThe fact that gay marriage is a topic of debate at all speaks to the intractability of the issue. It's a tempest in a teapot, a storm that rages and churns but ultimately resolves into nothing. And yet, it's a tempest that refuses to dissipate, a maelstrom that draws in the unwary. The constitution, a document of grand import, is not a vessel for the whims of the masses. It's a framework, a structure that guides us, not a plaything for the passions of the day.\n\nTo amend the constitution for the sake of banning gay marriage is a notion that strikes me as... misguided. A constitutional amendment is a solemn thing, a weighty matter that should not be taken lightly. It's a decision that should be approached with caution, with trepidation. And yet, in this case, I fear it's a decision that's driven more by emotion than reason.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a home where the words of scripture held sway, where the teachings of the Lord were the guiding force behind every decision. Yet, as I've grown and navigated the complexities of the world, I've found myself drawn to the fringes of that faith, questioning the certainties I once held dear. The matter of homosexuality, in particular, has caused me to wrestle with the fine lines that separate conviction and compassion.\n\nI've had the privilege of forming friendships with individuals who walk a path I don't fully understand, and in doing so, I've come to see the humanity in their struggles. I don't pretend to comprehend the intricacies of their experiences, but I do know that they are not so different from my own. We are all seekers, stumbling through the darkness, searching for a glimmer of light.\n\nAs I've grappled with this issue, I've come to the realization that I don't share the same fervor as some of my contemporaries. I don't see the world in binary terms, where one choice is the only acceptable path. Instead, I believe that the complexities of human emotion and experience demand a more nuanced approach. I think that individuals should have the freedom to live their lives as they see fit, as long as they're not harming others.\n\nThe notion that our leaders should dictate how we live our private lives feels suffocating. The idea that one person's perspective should be imposed upon an entire nation strikes me as a recipe for division and strife. I believe that each state should have the autonomy to determine its own values and laws, rather than relying on a single individual to make decisions for the masses.\n\nIt's a matter of personal responsibility, of living with the consequences of our choices. If I choose to reside in a state that has chosen to legalize gay marriage, then I must respect their decision, even if it differs from my own. I don't believe it's my place to dictate how others live their lives, as long as they're not infringing upon my own rights.\n\nThe notion that a single leader, like President Bush, should have the authority to impose his will on the nation feels anachronistic. He doesn't live in every state; he doesn't bear the weight of every decision that affects the people of this land. His term in office is finite, and when it ends, the decision will ultimately rest with those who come after him.\n\nIn the end, it's up to each individual state to chart its own course, to navigate the complexities of human experience. It's a messy, imperfect process, but it's one that acknowledges the diversity of our nation and the autonomy of its people. I believe that's where true freedom lies – not in the dictates of a single leader, but in the choices we make as individuals, as communities, and as a nation.",
            "The world of the internet, a vast and unfettered expanse where the gaze of the public is unfettered. A bulletin board, a forum for the airing of one's thoughts and intentions, where the pixelated eyes of the world converge to witness the unfolding drama of the self. And yet, the notion of privacy, that fragile and tenuous thing, is lost in the ether like autumn leaves on a gusty day.\n\nThe school officials, those guardians of the academic halls, had every right to peer into the recesses of a student's digital life. For in the public realm, all is fair game. The internet, a labyrinth of interconnected threads, beckons the curious and the prurient alike to explore its depths. And those who venture there do so with the knowledge that their every move is being watched, their every thought laid bare for all to see.\n\nBut what of the school's responsibility to safeguard its charges? Is it not the duty of those who oversee the halls of learning to ensure the well-being of their pupils? To shield them from the dangers that lurk in the shadows of the digital world, where the past and present converge in a maelstrom of consequences. The Columbine incident, a dark and foreboding specter, haunts the dreams of educators, a reminder of the potential for violence that lurks in the hearts of the young.\n\nThe school officials, then, were merely doing their duty, seeking to avert the catastrophe that could have befallen upon them. By monitoring the online lives of their students, they acted to prevent the very thing they feared - the unleashing of chaos and destruction. And in this, they stood as the sentinels of a fragile and besieged institution, ever vigilant in their pursuit of a safer, more secure environment.\n\nBut what of the individual's right to privacy, that cherished and oft-abused notion? Does not the student's expectation of anonymity in the digital realm take precedence over the school's responsibility to safeguard its charges? The answer, much like the digital footprints we leave behind, is a fleeting and ephemeral thing, lost in the vast and uncaring expanse of the internet.\n\nIn the end, it is not the internet that is the problem, but rather our own expectations of it. We venture into this vast and unfettered expanse with the hope of connection, of community, and of expression. But we do so at the risk of being seen, of being watched, and of being judged. And it is in this tension that we find the crux of the matter - the delicate balance between the pursuit of self and the need for safety.",
            "A vast and desolate emptiness had settled within me, a chasm carved by the events of nine eleven. At first, I was a vessel for the fervor that swept the land, my heart afire with a desire for retribution. The wounds of that day still lingered, a festering sore that seemed to cry out for salve. I was convinced that invasion was the answer, that the imposition of our will would bring order to the chaos. But as the months passed, a creeping doubt began to take hold. We had charged into the fray without a clear plan, our hearts heavy with emotion and our minds clouded by anger. We spoke of liberation, but did we truly understand the complexities of the land we sought to shape?\n\nThe people we sought to free were a tapestry woven from many threads, threads that were often at odds with one another. They were a people prone to savagery, their wars a brutal and unyielding thing. And I began to wonder if we were merely pawns in their game, if our presence was little more than a catalyst for their own internecine conflicts. The more I considered it, the more I came to believe that our intervention had been a mistake, a folly born of passion rather than prudence. We had attempted to impose our will upon a people who would not be swayed, who would not be changed. And in the end, it was we who were the ones who were changed, our hearts hardened by the experience.\n\nI often think of my uncle's words, spoken on a long-ago day by the lake's edge. He had taught me that the world was a complex and multifaceted thing, that its workings were not always easy to understand. And I began to see that our actions in that far-off land had been a testament to our own ignorance, our own arrogance. We had charged in with guns blazing, convinced of our own righteousness, but in the end, it was we who were left with the wounds.\n\nI do not know what the future holds, but I do know that our presence in that land has been a futile endeavor. We have made progress, to be sure, but it is progress that will not last. The land will continue to be a battleground, a place of bloodshed and strife. And we will be the ones who are left to pick up the pieces, to wonder why we had thought we could change the course of history. It is a lesson I will carry with me for the rest of my days, a reminder of the futility of our endeavors, and the dangers of acting without thought or foresight."
