            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The once-venerable institution of the Catholic Church stands at a crossroads, its waning influence a symptom of a broader malaise. A disconnect between the Church's stance on certain issues and the evolving values of its adherents has precipitated a decline in devotion. The Church's dogmatic views on matters like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, though well-intentioned, have grown archaic in their rigidity. By failing to adapt to the shifting tides of modernity, the Church risks losing its flock to a younger generation that demands a more inclusive and compassionate understanding.\n\nA Church that clings to an outdated worldview risks alienating those who would otherwise seek solace in its teachings. The specter of judgment and intolerance that hangs over certain issues drives away the very souls it seeks to nurture. In an era where the boundaries of acceptance are expanding, the Church's inflexibility appears as a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe prohibition on female priests and married clergy only serves to further exacerbate the disconnect. In an age where women hold positions of power and authority in nearly every sphere, the notion that they are somehow less suited to the priesthood seems anachronistic. And yet, despite this, the Church remains adamant in its stance. The consequences of this rigidity are evident in the dwindling numbers of adherents who feel unwelcome in a community that refuses to evolve.\n\nBut would even the relaxation of these rules have altered the course of events? It is impossible to know, and perhaps it is hubris to assume that such concessions would have been enough to prevent the exodus of devotees. The wounds run too deep, and the wounds of history cannot be so easily healed.\n\nAnd yet, it is precisely this inflexibility that raises the question: why must priests be unmarried? The Church's assertion that they are wedded to God is laudable, but it is a notion that rings hollow when set against the lived experience of those who have dedicated their lives to other pursuits. Why must the clergy be singled out for a life of solitary devotion? In a world where men and women must navigate the complexities of family and career, why must priests be exempt from these same challenges?\n\nIt is a question that speaks to the very heart of the Church's identity. Does it truly believe that its adherents are bound to a higher calling, one that supersedes the demands of the flesh? Or does it merely cling to a tradition that has outlived its purpose? The answer to this question will determine the course of the Church's future, and whether it will find a way to reclaim its relevance in a world that is rapidly leaving it behind.",
            "The existence of two souls bound in love is not a choice. It is an unyielding condition, an inescapable truth that defies the strictures of societal norms. I do not pretend to be an authority on the matter, but I do know this: that the manner in which one is born is not a decision, but a fate. We are each born with a certain inclination, a certain affinity, a certain unshakeable sense of self. The choice, if it can be called that, lies not in the heart's allegiance, but in the world's acceptance.\n\nTo deny two souls the right to consecrate their love, to bind themselves in matrimony, is to deny the inherent dignity of their existence. It is to imply that their love is somehow aberrant, somehow less authentic than the love between two souls of opposite sexes. I do not believe this to be the case. I believe that love knows no bounds, no distinctions, no limitations. It is a force that transcends the petty constraints of human convention.\n\nThe federal government, with its erstwhile authority, should not interfere in the private lives of its citizens. The issue of same-sex marriage is not a matter of national security, nor is it a question of moral rectitude. It is a question of basic human rights, of the freedom to love without fear of reprisal or persecution. The government should not seek to impose its will upon those who would seek to love as they are. It should not seek to dictate the terms of their existence.\n\nUltimately, the question of same-sex marriage is a simple one: should we not allow two souls to love as they are, to bind themselves together in the bond of matrimony, free from the constraints of societal expectation? I believe that we should. The world may view their love as aberrant, but I do not. I see it for what it is: a testament to the human spirit, a testament to the enduring power of love in all its forms.",
            "In the desolate expanse of our society, a fundamental question lingers, a specter that haunts the fringes of our collective conscience: the legalization of gay marriage. The wind howls through the barren lands, whipping up dust devils of ignorance and prejudice, as we stumble through the wasteland of our moral ambiguities.\n\nIt is a notion that has long been shrouded in an impenetrable haze, a mystery waiting to be unraveled. Many claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, a notion that is as baseless as the ash that blankets the earth. For what is a family, truly? Is it not two souls bound together by love and commitment, regardless of the intricacies of their relationship? Is it not a bond that transcends the petty squabbles of society, a union that speaks to the very essence of human connection?\n\nBut the proponents of this antiquated view cling to their biases, their arguments as hollow as the shells of the wind-blasted trees that line our roads. They claim that gay couples are somehow less worthy of recognition, that their love is an aberration, a deviation from the norm. But what is normal, truly? Is it not the pursuit of happiness, the yearning for connection that defines us as human beings? And is not love the very fabric that weaves our lives together?\n\nThe statistics are clear: gay couples exhibit the same rates of success, the same factors contributing to satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts. They are not asking for the right to wed in a church, but for a simple marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the very government that claims to represent us all. Why, then, must we deny them this fundamental right? Is it not a matter of fairness, of equality? Or are we content to live in a society where some are more equal than others?\n\nThe segregation of separate but unequal is a hollow argument, a feeble attempt to justify the injustices that we inflict upon one another. We speak of morality, of the teachings of our churches, but do we not risk hypocrisy when we allow our personal beliefs to dictate the laws of our land? Can we truly claim to be a just society when we deny the rights of a segment of our population simply because of their sexual orientation?\n\nAnd what of the children, those precious innocents who are caught in the crossfire of our prejudices? Do we not risk inflicting upon them a lifetime of pain and suffering by denying their parents the rights and privileges that we take for granted? The American Psychological Association has spoken, and their words are clear: the claims of psychological damage are unfounded, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nAs we stumble through this desolate landscape, we would do well to remember that our opinions are not the only ones that matter. We would do well to listen to the institutions that have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge, to the research and studies that have shed light on this issue. For in the end, it is not our personal biases that will decide the fate of gay marriage, but our collective willingness to recognize the inherent value of every human being.\n\nLet us not be swayed by the winds of ignorance, but rather by the gentle breeze of compassion and understanding. Let us walk the narrow path of justice, and let us ensure that our society is a place where love knows no bounds, where every individual is treated with dignity and respect. For in the end, it is not the laws that we make, but the hearts that we hold that truly define us as human beings.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy, where the fluorescent lights hum a monotonous dirge, I toil in the sweltering summer months. The smell of antiseptic wafts through the air, a constant reminder of the fragility of life. Yet, amidst this sterile backdrop, I find myself pondering the oft-maligned subject of illicit substances. \n\nJust as the law's restrictive grasp cannot deny the medicinal virtues of certain controlled substances, such as oxycodone or Vicodin, so too must we not dismiss the potential benefits of cannabis. The notion that a drug's illegality somehow negates its utility is a fallacy, a product of societal taboo rather than scientific fact. \n\nAs a pharmacy technician, I've witnessed firsthand the responsible use of prohibited substances in medical contexts. Why, then, do we not extend the same consideration to marijuana? The parallels between the two, though imperfect, are striking. Like alcohol, marijuana's abuse can lead to deleterious consequences; yet, just as we do not outlaw the latter, we should not hastily condemn the former. \n\nPerhaps the key lies in a gradual, measured approach, rather than an abrupt shift in policy. By first dismantling the stigmatized image surrounding marijuana, we may foster a more responsible attitude towards its use. The vilification of this substance has created a misconception, one that obscures its potential therapeutic benefits. By acknowledging these advantages, we may yet unlock a new frontier in medicine. \n\nBut alas, the ingrained prejudices run deep. The specter of heroin and cocaine looms large, casting a dark shadow over marijuana's reputation. It is a stubborn stain, one that requires time, patience, and a willingness to reexamine our assumptions. Only then can we hope to transcend the haze of misconception and unlock the truth behind this oft-maligned substance.",
            "In a world that has shed its staidness, the church has undergone a metamorphosis, adapting to the twenty-first century with a newfound flexibility. No longer a bastion of rigidity, it has begun to shed the strictures of its former self, its once-imposing façade now worn and weathered by the whispers of time.\n\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I am reminded of the church as it was in my youth – a place of solemnity and reverence, where the air was thick with the scent of sanctity and the rustle of starched fabric. Every Sunday, I donned my Sunday best – a demure dress, matching shoes, and a purse to match – and joined my friends at the private school I attended on weekends. The ritual was a comforting one, a sense of predictability that anchored me in a world that seemed to be spinning ever more rapidly.\n\nBut as I grew older, I noticed a subtle yet profound change. The church, once a bastion of tradition, began to succumb to the zeitgeist of a more casual era. The teenage mass, a innovation that sought to engage the younger generation, was a telling sign of the times. Services were now neatly condensed into thirty minutes, a fleeting snapshot of devotion in an increasingly harried world. The once-formal attire gave way to a more relaxed, even casual, dress code. Summer Sundays saw beachwear creeping into the pews, a testament to the church's willingness to adapt.\n\nAs I observe this shift, I am struck by the essence of the institution. The church, like the world around it, is a reflection of humanity's evolving values. It is a place where tradition and innovation coexist, where the sacred and the mundane intersect. And yet, despite this adaptability, the church remains a cipher, an enigma that continues to elude my understanding.\n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I am reminded of the complexity of human nature. The notion that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these atrocities is a simplistic one. Pedophilia, I believe, is a product of genetics, a deeply ingrained aspect of an individual's makeup. It is not a choice, a vice that can be eradicated through marriage or any other means. The church, like any institution, is a reflection of humanity at its worst and best. While it is true that some priests have been accused of abuse, it is also true that many have dedicated their lives to selfless service.\n\nThe example of Seventh Heaven, a denomination that allows its ministers to marry, serves as a counterpoint to the Catholic Church's stance. Yet, it also highlights the individual's choice to pursue a particular faith or vocation. If an individual's desires are at odds with the requirements of their faith, perhaps it is time to reevaluate their commitment.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers. The Catholic Church, like the world around it, is a tapestry of contradictions – a place of beauty and ugliness, of light and darkness. Its evolution is a reflection of humanity's own, a slow and halting process that grapples with the complexities of existence.",
            "The ashes of the century still lingered, a cold and festering wound that refused to heal. The echoes of a calamitous day still lingered, a hollowed-out refrain that seemed to seep into every pore. The wounds of September's brutal birth pangs still bled, a festering sore that had yet to scab. The nation's collective psyche remained a maelstrom of anger, a churning sea of discontent that threatened to engulf all in its path. The winds of war had been fanned by the whispers of a pretext, a thin veil of deceit that had been woven to conceal the true intent of those who held the reins.\n\nThe Bush administration, a cabal of men driven by a zealot's fervor, had set the nation ablaze with a war of choice, a conflict born of hubris and a desire for dominance. The lies had been legion, a litany of half-truths and outright fabrications that had been peddled to the public with a zeal that bordered on the fanatical. The notion that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to the nation's security, that he harbored weapons of mass destruction, was a myth, a chimera conjured by the fevered imagination of those who would seek to justify their actions.\n\nAnd yet, even now, the wounds ran deep, a festering sore that refused to heal. The Constitution, that sacred document that had been the cornerstone of the nation's foundation, had been trampled, its principles and ideals cast aside like so much rubbish. The disregard for the rule of law, the flaunting of power, had become a hallmark of the administration, a litany of abuses that had been perpetrated with impunity.\n\nAs the nation teetered on the brink of collapse, the question remained: what had been the true intention of the war? Was it a quest for oil, a desire to secure the nation's energy needs, or was it something more sinister, a bid for dominance in a world that was rapidly changing? The answer, much like the truth, remained shrouded in mystery, a enigma that refused to yield to the probing of reason.\n\nThe situation in Iraq, a quagmire of chaos and confusion, seemed to be spiraling out of control. The interim government, a fragile entity, teetered on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty threatened by the very nations that sought to prop it up. The Parliament, a body supposedly empowered to govern, was a mere shell of its former self, a hollow vessel devoid of purpose or direction. The radicals, a cauldron of dissent and discontent, simmered just below the surface, waiting to boil over and engulf all in their path.\n\nAnd yet, even in the midst of this maelstrom, a glimmer of hope remained. A coalition of nations, a patchwork of interests and ideologies, sought to impose order on the chaos, to bring a modicum of stability to a nation on the brink of collapse. But would it be enough? Or would the very attempts to impose order only serve to exacerbate the problem, to sow the seeds of discord and strife that would ultimately lead to a bitter harvest of blood and tears?\n\nOnly time would tell, but one thing was certain: the wounds of the past would not easily heal, and the future, like the present, remained shrouded in uncertainty, a dark and foreboding mist that threatened to engulf all in its path.",
            "He spoke in hushed tones, his words lost in the haze of indecision.  I'm not sure where to begin, he said, the words like ashes on his tongue.  The War in Iraq, a thing that had consumed the air, the news, the very fabric of life.  He thought of it as a beast, a thing that gnawed at the edges of the world, leaving only ruin in its wake.\n\nIt was a war that had never been declared, a shadowy thing that lurched forward with a hunger for power and for oil.  They had gone in with guns and bombs, with a promise of democracy and freedom.  But it had become a thing of ash and dust, a desolate landscape of burned cities and shattered lives.\n\nHe thought of the families, the sons and daughters who had gone to fight, leaving behind the warmth of home and the comfort of loved ones.  Their faces etched in his mind like the faces of the dead.  The ones who had come back, their eyes haunted, their hearts heavy with the weight of what they had seen.\n\nHe thought of the people of Iraq, their culture shattered, their lives torn apart by the very forces that had come to help.  The Al-Kaida, a hydra-like thing that seemed to grow stronger with each passing day.  Their hatred for the United States a thing that deepened with each passing moment.\n\nHe didn't know what to think, what to feel.  It was a morass of conflicting emotions, a tangle of threads that he couldn't seem to untangle.  He felt a sense of responsibility, a sense of duty to the boys and girls who had gone to fight.  But he also felt a sense of shame, a sense of guilt for the lives that had been lost, the lives that had been torn apart.\n\nThe words tumbled out of him like a confession, a prayer, a plea for understanding.  It was a war that had become a thing of ash and dust, a desolate landscape of burned cities and shattered lives.  He didn't know if it was worth it, if the cost had been worth the gain.  All he knew was that it was a thing that would haunt him, a thing that would stay with him for the rest of his days.\n\nThe words trailed off, lost in the silence.  He was left with only questions, only doubts.  The War in Iraq, a thing that had consumed the air, the news, the very fabric of life.  A thing that would haunt him, a thing that would stay with him forever.",
            "The notion of imposing a law, a declaration of what is permissible or not, strikes a discordant note within me. It is a notion that borders on the hubris of those who would seek to impose their will upon the realm of the sacred, of the churches, where faith and conviction hold sway. The constitution, that enduring testament to the principles of our nation, speaks of the separation of church and state, a clear and unmistakable demarcation between the realms of the temporal and the eternal. To tamper with this balance would be to invite chaos, to upset the delicate equipoise that has been established.\n\nThe churches, not the government, are the proper arbiters of such matters. It is they who have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of the divine, who have walked the hallowed paths of faith for centuries. The government, with its pretensions to omniscience, should not usurp the authority of the churches. To do so would be to elevate the mundane over the sacred, to confuse the roles of the temporal and the eternal.\n\nThe notion of an amendment, of a law imposed by the hand of the state, would be a perversion of the principles that our constitution enshrines. It would be a restriction, not of the government, but of the people, a stifling of their freedom to worship, to believe as they see fit. And for what purpose? To impose the will of one church, one creed, upon the many? It is a notion devoid of merit, a relic of a outdated thinking that would seek to impose a narrow, dogmatic view upon a pluralistic society.\n\nI do not see the rationale behind such an amendment, save for the personal convictions of a few. The president's actions, in pushing for such a law, smack of a disregard for the separation of church and state, a willingness to impose his own views upon the nation, in direct contravention of the principles enshrined in our constitution. It is a step down a perilous path, one that would lead us further down the road of intolerance, of restriction, of the stifling of individual freedom.\n\nIn truth, I see little reason for such an amendment. It would do little to improve our economy, our society, our lives. In fact, it might have a negative impact, stifling the very freedoms that our nation was founded upon. The government should not be involved in this issue, should not seek to impose its will upon the churches. The people, in their diversity, should be free to worship as they see fit, to follow the dictates of their hearts, not the edicts of the state.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should not be involved in this matter. The churches, not the government, should be the arbiters of such issues. The constitution, that sacred document, speaks clearly and unequivocally on this matter. Let us not forget its words, let us not forget the principles that have guided us thus far. Let us preserve the separation of church and state, and allow the people to worship as they see fit, free from the interference of the state.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict born of deceit and hubris. It was a war that began as a shroud of secrecy, a tangled web of half-truths and misdirection. The government's justifications, a whispered litany of lies, designed to stir the passions of the American people, to cloak the invasion in a mantle of righteousness. The echoes of September 11th, a distant memory, a false pretext for the blood-soaked sands of Mesopotamia. The drums of war beat out a rhythm of fear and anger, a siren's song that lured the nation into the abyss.\n\nWe were a people, lost and searching, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own self-importance. We were told that the Iraqi government was a monster, a grotesque and malevolent force that threatened our very way of life. But was it not a lie? Were we not being deceived, led astray by the insidious whisperings of our own leaders? The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a cautionary tale of a war that had been lost, a war that had claimed the lives of countless young men, a war that had left a nation scarred and bitter.\n\nAnd yet, we walked into the void, blind and unprepared, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own arrogance. We removed the government, leaving a power vacuum, a chasm of chaos that would swallow us whole. The aftermath, a nightmarish tapestry of blood and fire, a litany of death and despair. The insurgency, a hydra-headed beast, a creature that would not be slain. We fought the citizens, the very people we claimed to liberate, and we were defeated.\n\nWe were not prepared for the consequences of our actions, nor did we understand the nature of the enemy we faced. We were naive, blinded by our own righteousness, our own self-importance. We were not fighting an army, but a people, a people who refused to be subjugated, a people who would not be silenced. The war in Iraq, a repeat of the mistakes of the past, a war that would haunt us for generations to come.\n\nWe are still there, mired in the quagmire, our casualties mounting, our dreams of a free and democratic Iraq slipping further and further away. The oil, a siren's song, a lure that beckoned us to the abyss. The true reasons for the war, shrouded in secrecy, hidden from the prying eyes of the public. The lies, the half-truths, the misdirection, a cleverly woven tapestry of deceit.\n\nAnd so we are stuck, trapped in a cycle of violence and fear, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own hubris. We are a people, lost and searching, our way forward shrouded in uncertainty. The war in Iraq, a dark and foreboding presence, a shadow that looms over our collective conscience. We can only hope that it will end soon, that the bloodshed will cease, and that peace will return to that troubled land.",
            "The thought stirs like a flame in the dark, a flickering thing that refuses to be extinguished. I am drawn to it, this notion of love without bounds, of two souls entwined in a dance of devotion. It is a notion that has long been a part of me, a whispered promise to myself, a gentle urging to break free from the constraints of a world that seeks to define us by the whims of others.\n\nIn the stillness of night, when the world is hushed and the shadows reign, I am reminded of the fragility of life, the ephemeral nature of our existence. And yet, in this fleeting moment, I find solace in the knowledge that love knows no bounds, that it can transcend the confines of societal expectations, of familial norms, of ancient traditions. It is a love that is raw, unbridled, and unapologetic, a love that refuses to be silenced by the whispers of doubt and fear.\n\nI have always believed that love is a fundamental right, a basic human necessity that should be granted to all, regardless of the labels we assign to it. It is a right that should be protected, cherished, and upheld, not denied or diminished by the arrogance of those who would seek to impose their will upon others. For love is not a choice, it is a calling, a primal urge that cannot be tamed or controlled.\n\nIn this bleak and barren world, where the winds howl and the ash falls like a shroud, I find hope in the resilience of the human spirit. I see it in the way two people, bound by love, can weather the storms, can face the darkness, and can emerge stronger, more steadfast, and more unbreakable. It is a love that is forged in the fire of adversity, tempered by the trials of a world that seeks to tear us apart.\n\nAnd so, I stand steadfast in my conviction, unwavering in my resolve. I believe that love knows no bounds, that it is a fundamental right, a basic human necessity that should be upheld and cherished. I believe that love is a flame that burns bright, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of it. And I believe that it is a love that should be free to flourish, unencumbered by the constraints of societal expectations, unshackled by the chains of oppression.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the laws that govern us, nor the politics that divide us, nor the norms that constrain us, that truly matter. It is the love that we share, the love that we give, and the love that we receive. It is the love that burns within us, a flame that flickers brightly, a light that shines brightly in the darkness.",
            "He'd learned the lesson of the voided spaces where words reside. Where thoughts without borders spread like ash on the wind. When something was placed in the public expanse, it lost all vestige of sanctuary. It became a thing without bounds, a thing that could not be recalled. A thing that would forever bear the weight of perception. As an RA, he'd witnessed it firsthand - the careless utterances, the misplaced words that could spark a fire. The bulletin that arrived at the school, its origin unknown, a harbinger of dread. The friends who'd stumbled upon it, their faces etched with concern. The search for the source, the parsing of intent. The line between jest and gravity, forever blurred.\n\nThe internet, a vast and unforgiving plain, where words were currency and reputation was the cost. No refuge from the gaze of the many, where the private was an illusion. When you entered the public sphere, you surrendered to the whims of others. You couldn't dictate how they'd receive your words, or what they'd make of them. The school officials, bound by duty, had to act on the information they gathered. They couldn't ignore the whispers of a potentially volatile situation. The question, always, was whether the intentions behind the words were genuine or a ruse, a sociology experiment gone awry.\n\nHe thought back to the incident at school, where a student's Facebook page had been scrutinized, its contents deemed a cause for concern. The boundaries between private and public had been breached, and the consequences had been severe. The realization had struck him - the internet was a realm without borders, where the notion of privacy was a myth. If you didn't want your words to be seen, don't put them out there. If you didn't want someone to think a certain way, you couldn't control their thoughts. Schools, he believed, shouldn't befriend their students on social media platforms, shouldn't snoop through their online presence. But if concerns were raised, and the warning signs were heeded, the school had a duty to act. The line between monitoring and invasion of privacy was thin, but when danger loomed, it was a distinction that mattered little.\n\nHe'd learned to be mindful of his words, to consider the reach they might have. To think before posting, before sharing. The world, it seemed, was a fragile tapestry, where a single misstep could unravel the entire fabric. And in this vast and unforgiving expanse, he'd do well to remember the lesson of the voided spaces - that words, once spoken, could not be recalled, and their consequences, forever unbound.",
            "In the wasteland of reason, the war has been reduced to a hollow shell of its former purpose. What was once a crusade to restore democracy in a foreign land has devolved into a protracted exercise in futility. The original intent, to bring light to a land shrouded in tyranny, has been lost in the dust of time. The ghosts of George Bush's past animosities with Saddam Hussein still linger, casting a shadow over the true motivations behind the war.\n\nThe initial spark, a beacon of hope in the darkness, has flickered out, leaving behind a smoldering ember of justification. The war, once a clarion call to freedom, has become a Sisyphean task, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and despair. The first skirmishes, a decisive blow for democracy, have given way to a drawn-out stalemate, a war of attrition that has drained the lifeblood from our economy.\n\nWe were once driven by a noble purpose, a desire to liberate a people from the shackles of oppression. But that purpose has been eroded, worn down by the relentless tides of time. We have lost sight of the initial goal, and now we are mired in a quagmire of our own making. The war has become a self-perpetuating machine, a monster that feeds on our resources, our lives, and our very soul.\n\nThe cost is staggering, a drain on our economy that could be better spent on the pressing needs of our own people. The wars on poverty, education, and healthcare cry out for attention, but our treasure is squandered on a conflict that has long since lost its way. We are bleeding our treasury dry, sacrificing our own citizens on the altar of a cause that has been lost.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to a simple question: what is the true cost of our actions? Is it not time to acknowledge that the war has been a failure, a Pyrrhic victory that has achieved nothing but the perpetuation of a cycle of violence? We must confront the reality of our situation, and acknowledge that it is time to bring this sense of purpose to an end. The war has outlived its usefulness, and it is time to let it go.",
            "A question hung unspoken, like a thing of fragile glass suspended in the air, waiting to shatter. It had to do with the tracings of the past, the echoes of moments lived and lost, and the fragile boundaries of a person's private self. He recalled the words of an old man, a sage from a bygone era, who said that once a thing was placed upon the altar of the internet, it was as though it had been cast to the winds, subject to the whims of an unfeeling world. And so it was with Myspace, a digital realm where the veil of anonymity was but a thin membrane, easily pierced by the prying eyes of others.\n\nHe had heard the tale of a young soul, a wanderer in the digital wilderness, who had stumbled upon a profile, a digital shrine to a person's innermost thoughts and desires. And in that moment, a life was saved, a potential catastrophe averted. Yet, the boy's words hung in the air, a query that spoke to the very heart of the issue: was it right to expect that others would watch over us, to shield us from the dangers that lurked in the shadows of the net?\n\nHe thought of the boy's words, of the fragile balance between freedom and safety, between the desire for anonymity and the need for protection. It was a delicate dance, a precarious tightrope walked by those who ventured into the digital realm. And the consequences of a misstep? Ah, those were as uncertain as the wind that whipped through the dead trees, as ephemeral as the ashes that swirled in the breeze.\n\nIn the end, it was a question that begged for no easy answer, a riddle without a solution. For in the world of the internet, the lines between public and private were blurred, the boundaries between freedom and surveillance ever-shifting. And so, the boy's question hung in the air, a haunting reminder of the fragility of the human heart, and the uncertain future that lay ahead.",
            "The ghosts of war still linger in the ash-scarred landscape. The Iraq War, a calamity of unyielding proportions, continues to haunt us, a specter of hubris and miscalculation. To speak of it now feels like an exercise in futility, a vain attempt to grasp the ungraspable. And yet, I am drawn to the void, compelled to confront the ruin that we have wrought.\n\nLike a man wandering through a desolate landscape, I find myself torn between the weight of conviction and the crushing weight of doubt. I was against the war from the beginning, yet now it seems almost irrelevant, a fact lost in the din of history. The polls, a cacophony of numbers and opinions, scream in unison: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world, eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops, all concurring in their assessment: this war was a grave mistake.\n\nThe administration's recklessness, a product of its own myopia, blinds it to the inherent contradictions of its actions. The Middle East, a cauldron of ancient animosities and cultural fault lines, defies the simplistic notions of democracy and progress. The notion that we can impose our will upon this complex tapestry, that we can somehow \"bring democracy\" to a region where it has never taken root, is a conceit born of arrogance and ignorance.\n\nSaddam, a monstrous figure, may have been a bad man, but his ousting has unleashed a maelstrom of chaos, a quagmire from which we may never extricate ourselves. The administration's talking points, a jumble of half-truths and convenient fictions, fail to convince. The problems of withdrawal, they claim, are too dire, too complex. But I see no legitimate reason to stay. The voices of the Iraqis, the people we claim to be saving, cry out for our departure. Eighty percent, a staggering majority, demand our withdrawal within the year. And what of the quarter who urge us to leave now? Might they not know better than we, the would-be saviors, what is best for their own land?\n\nIf we leave, we can absolve ourselves of responsibility for the disaster that has unfolded. We can say, with a modicum of truth, that we were forced to withdraw by the will of the Iraqi people. But even this weak excuse will not suffice. We will never be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, not now, not ever. All we can hope for is to mitigate the damage, to leave with a semblance of dignity, rather than the ignominy of continued occupation.\n\nAnd so I ask: what now? How do we extricate ourselves from this festering wound? The answer, like the war itself, remains elusive, a mirage on the horizon of history. But one thing is certain: we must leave, and we must leave soon. The ghosts of war will not rest until we do.",
            "The air was heavy with the weight of unspoken truths, like the faint scent of rain on a dry earth. The fire of equality still smoldered, a flickering flame that danced with the wind of societal norms. I believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, a cancer that seeps into the marrow of our being. It is not a question of men and women alone, but rather the consequence of a culture that has been shaped by the past.\n\nIn the field of work, the glass ceiling still looms, a reminder that even with equality on the books, it is a struggle to shatter the silence of a legacy that reveres the status quo. Women, in particular, face a daunting task in piercing the veil of prejudice, for it is a world that has been crafted to favor the masculine. They strive to reach the pinnacle of success, only to find themselves hemmed in by the fragile glass that separates them from the upper echelons of power.\n\nBut it is not just women who face this trial. Men, too, are bound by the chains of societal expectation. Those who choose to stay at home, to nurture and care for their children, are met with skepticism and scorn, their masculinity called into question. The world looks upon them with a mixture of disdain and confusion, unable to comprehend the notion of a man who puts family above the altar of profit.\n\nIn the fashion industry, the stereotypes are even more pronounced. Men who dare to venture into this realm are often met with suspicion, their seriousness doubted, their passion questioned. They are seen as anomalies, outsiders who do not belong, their masculinity suspect because of their association with a world that is deemed feminine.\n\nBut change is a slow and tortuous process. It is a journey that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to challenge the status quo. We have come a long way, to be sure, but we still have far to go. The fight for equality is not a battle to be won overnight, but a marathon that demands our collective effort.\n\nPerhaps the key to progress lies not in forcing the issue, but in promoting the qualities that define us as individuals. By celebrating the strengths and weaknesses of those who are often stereotyped, we can begin to break down the walls that separate us. We must recognize that intelligence and worth are not solely the domain of the well-spoken, but rather the province of those who dare to be different.\n\nUltimately, the fight for equality is a journey that knows no bounds, a path that winds through the complexities of our collective experience. It is a road that is fraught with obstacles, but one that holds the promise of a brighter tomorrow. As we move forward, let us not forget that change is a gradual process, one that requires our collective effort and our unwavering commitment to the cause.\n\nIn the end, it is not just about men and women, but about the humanity that unites us all. It is about recognizing that we are all equal, that we are all deserving of respect and dignity, regardless of our background or our profession. And it is this understanding that will ultimately guide us toward a future where equality is not just a dream, but a reality.",
            "The understanding of the legal landscape is that they did not completely legalize it, but rather decriminalized it, stripping it of its former status as a felony charge. It is now akin to a traffic infraction, one that garners a citation rather than a full-blown arrest and prolonged court proceedings. Those who are caught are not burdened with the weight of a formal conviction, a concern that had previously hampered many who worried about the long-term implications on their future prospects, such as employment and social standing. Yet, there exists a counterargument that the fiscal burden of policing and prosecuting such offenses is considerable. The cost of apprehending, detaining, and processing individuals, only to release them later, can be a significant drain on municipal resources. Many financially strained municipalities hesitate to adopt such a measure, even if it would free up capital for more pressing needs.\n\nHowever, in places where public opinion leans more liberal, like Denver, decriminalization has become a matter of course. The resulting windfall of revenue has been redirected toward vital community programs, such as education, social services for the elderly, and feeding initiatives for those in need. It is a pragmatic approach that acknowledges the dual nature of this substance – its potential benefits and drawbacks. While its widespread availability might prove a concern, the financial and social implications of its prohibition cannot be ignored.\n\nOne of the lingering reservations about marijuana legalization pertains to its societal acceptance. Some worry that its widespread availability would undermine the cultural taboo surrounding it, leading to public use and, by extension, impaired driving. However, it is worth noting that alcohol, another substance with well-documented impairing effects, has yet to be fully eradicated from our society. Each substance has its unique impact on individuals, influenced by factors such as personality and life choices.\n\nModeration and self-control are key, as people's reactions to substances can vary significantly. It is challenging to generalize about the effects of marijuana, as individuals respond differently. Both alcohol and marijuana have negative consequences, and while some individuals can navigate these substances with ease, others may struggle. This nuanced understanding highlights the complexity of the issue, underscoring the importance of continued dialogue and informed decision-making.",
            "The notion of adhering to tradition is a weight that settles heavy upon the soul. Like the slow accumulation of ash on a weathered stone, the rituals and practices of a bygone era can suffocate the very life that seeks to breathe within them. The Catholic Church, an institution steeped in the rich soil of tradition, stands as a testament to this assertion. Its dogma, a labyrinth of doctrine and teaching, binds the faithful to a strict adherence to the ways of old.\n\nYet, like a river that refuses to be contained, change always seeks to seep into the cracks of the established order. The Church, too, has been shaped by the currents of time, its own waters churning with the disparate voices of its followers. The tension between tradition and adaptability is a chasm that yawns wide, threatening to swallow the very foundations of the institution.\n\nA passage of time, a span of years, a silence of decades – and the world shifts, ever so imperceptibly. The Church, too, must shift, or risk being consumed by the very traditions it seeks to uphold. And yet, like a tree that clings to its ancient roots, it resists the gentle tug of progress. The result is a disconnect, a schism that runs deep, a gulf that separates the teachings of the Church from the lived experience of its followers.\n\nConsider, if you will, the doctrine of love. \"Love thy neighbor as thyself,\" a teaching that echoes through the halls of scripture. And yet, the practice of the Church often seems to falter in its application of this very principle. The prohibition against marrying outside the faith, the rejection of those who do not conform to the established norms – these are but a few examples of the disconnect that exists between the teachings of the Church and the lived reality of its followers.\n\nThe issue of priestly marriage is a case in point. Some argue that allowing priests to wed would help to curb the scourge of pedophilia that has ravaged the Church. But is this not a simplistic solution, one that fails to address the deeper rot that festers within the institution? The abuse of power, the corruption of the sacred – these are not solved by the mere act of marriage. They require a fundamental shift in the way the Church views itself, a recognition that its teachings must be lived, not merely recited.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution that will save us, but the individuals who comprise it. It is not the tradition that will heal the wounds of the past, but the willingness to confront them head-on. As the world outside continues to shift and change, the Church must do the same, lest it be left behind, a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of a time when tradition was more important than the lives of its followers.",
            "A thing that weighs upon my mind, a matter that defies easy resolution. I find myself torn, suspended between the crevices of a dichotomy. The line separating church and state, a divide so fine it's nigh impossible to traverse. And the notion of marriage, a concept as slippery as a snake through the grass. It's a puzzle, a riddle, a thing that shifts and writhes like a living thing.\n\nI'm not one to take a stand, to stake my claim on a particular side of the fence. But I will say this: the boundaries between civil union and sacrament blur and blend like the hues of a sunset. Marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil contract to others. And what of the government's role in all this? Should it concern itself with the sanctity of the union, or merely the legalities? I think it should be the latter. The state's domain is one of law, not dogma.\n\nThe fact that gay marriage is a topic of debate at all speaks to the intractability of the issue. It's a tempest in a teapot, a storm that rages and churns but ultimately resolves into nothing. And yet, it's a tempest that refuses to dissipate, a maelstrom that draws in the unwary. The constitution, a document of grand import, is not a vessel for the whims of the masses. It's a framework, a structure that guides us, not a plaything for the passions of the day.\n\nTo amend the constitution for the sake of banning gay marriage is a notion that strikes me as... misguided. A constitutional amendment is a solemn thing, a weighty matter that should not be taken lightly. It's a decision that should be approached with caution, with trepidation. And yet, in this case, I fear it's a decision that's driven more by emotion than reason.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a home where the words of scripture held sway, where the teachings of the Lord were the guiding force behind every decision. Yet, as I've grown and navigated the complexities of the world, I've found myself drawn to the fringes of that faith, questioning the certainties I once held dear. The matter of homosexuality, in particular, has caused me to wrestle with the fine lines that separate conviction and compassion.\n\nI've had the privilege of forming friendships with individuals who walk a path I don't fully understand, and in doing so, I've come to see the humanity in their struggles. I don't pretend to comprehend the intricacies of their experiences, but I do know that they are not so different from my own. We are all seekers, stumbling through the darkness, searching for a glimmer of light.\n\nAs I've grappled with this issue, I've come to the realization that I don't share the same fervor as some of my contemporaries. I don't see the world in binary terms, where one choice is the only acceptable path. Instead, I believe that the complexities of human emotion and experience demand a more nuanced approach. I think that individuals should have the freedom to live their lives as they see fit, as long as they're not harming others.\n\nThe notion that our leaders should dictate how we live our private lives feels suffocating. The idea that one person's perspective should be imposed upon an entire nation strikes me as a recipe for division and strife. I believe that each state should have the autonomy to determine its own values and laws, rather than relying on a single individual to make decisions for the masses.\n\nIt's a matter of personal responsibility, of living with the consequences of our choices. If I choose to reside in a state that has chosen to legalize gay marriage, then I must respect their decision, even if it differs from my own. I don't believe it's my place to dictate how others live their lives, as long as they're not infringing upon my own rights.\n\nThe notion that a single leader, like President Bush, should have the authority to impose his will on the nation feels anachronistic. He doesn't live in every state; he doesn't bear the weight of every decision that affects the people of this land. His term in office is finite, and when it ends, the decision will ultimately rest with those who come after him.\n\nIn the end, it's up to each individual state to chart its own course, to navigate the complexities of human experience. It's a messy, imperfect process, but it's one that acknowledges the diversity of our nation and the autonomy of its people. I believe that's where true freedom lies – not in the dictates of a single leader, but in the choices we make as individuals, as communities, and as a nation.",
            "The world of the internet, a vast and unfettered expanse where the gaze of the public is unfettered. A bulletin board, a forum for the airing of one's thoughts and intentions, where the pixelated eyes of the world converge to witness the unfolding drama of the self. And yet, the notion of privacy, that fragile and tenuous thing, is lost in the ether like autumn leaves on a gusty day.\n\nThe school officials, those guardians of the academic halls, had every right to peer into the recesses of a student's digital life. For in the public realm, all is fair game. The internet, a labyrinth of interconnected threads, beckons the curious and the prurient alike to explore its depths. And those who venture there do so with the knowledge that their every move is being watched, their every thought laid bare for all to see.\n\nBut what of the school's responsibility to safeguard its charges? Is it not the duty of those who oversee the halls of learning to ensure the well-being of their pupils? To shield them from the dangers that lurk in the shadows of the digital world, where the past and present converge in a maelstrom of consequences. The Columbine incident, a dark and foreboding specter, haunts the dreams of educators, a reminder of the potential for violence that lurks in the hearts of the young.\n\nThe school officials, then, were merely doing their duty, seeking to avert the catastrophe that could have befallen upon them. By monitoring the online lives of their students, they acted to prevent the very thing they feared - the unleashing of chaos and destruction. And in this, they stood as the sentinels of a fragile and besieged institution, ever vigilant in their pursuit of a safer, more secure environment.\n\nBut what of the individual's right to privacy, that cherished and oft-abused notion? Does not the student's expectation of anonymity in the digital realm take precedence over the school's responsibility to safeguard its charges? The answer, much like the digital footprints we leave behind, is a fleeting and ephemeral thing, lost in the vast and uncaring expanse of the internet.\n\nIn the end, it is not the internet that is the problem, but rather our own expectations of it. We venture into this vast and unfettered expanse with the hope of connection, of community, and of expression. But we do so at the risk of being seen, of being watched, and of being judged. And it is in this tension that we find the crux of the matter - the delicate balance between the pursuit of self and the need for safety.",
            "A vast and desolate emptiness had settled within me, a chasm carved by the events of nine eleven. At first, I was a vessel for the fervor that swept the land, my heart afire with a desire for retribution. The wounds of that day still lingered, a festering sore that seemed to cry out for salve. I was convinced that invasion was the answer, that the imposition of our will would bring order to the chaos. But as the months passed, a creeping doubt began to take hold. We had charged into the fray without a clear plan, our hearts heavy with emotion and our minds clouded by anger. We spoke of liberation, but did we truly understand the complexities of the land we sought to shape?\n\nThe people we sought to free were a tapestry woven from many threads, threads that were often at odds with one another. They were a people prone to savagery, their wars a brutal and unyielding thing. And I began to wonder if we were merely pawns in their game, if our presence was little more than a catalyst for their own internecine conflicts. The more I considered it, the more I came to believe that our intervention had been a mistake, a folly born of passion rather than prudence. We had attempted to impose our will upon a people who would not be swayed, who would not be changed. And in the end, it was we who were the ones who were changed, our hearts hardened by the experience.\n\nI often think of my uncle's words, spoken on a long-ago day by the lake's edge. He had taught me that the world was a complex and multifaceted thing, that its workings were not always easy to understand. And I began to see that our actions in that far-off land had been a testament to our own ignorance, our own arrogance. We had charged in with guns blazing, convinced of our own righteousness, but in the end, it was we who were left with the wounds.\n\nI do not know what the future holds, but I do know that our presence in that land has been a futile endeavor. We have made progress, to be sure, but it is progress that will not last. The land will continue to be a battleground, a place of bloodshed and strife. And we will be the ones who are left to pick up the pieces, to wonder why we had thought we could change the course of history. It is a lesson I will carry with me for the rest of my days, a reminder of the futility of our endeavors, and the dangers of acting without thought or foresight."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The once-venerable institution of the Catholic Church stands at a crossroads, its waning influence a symptom of a broader malaise. A disconnect between the Church's stance on certain issues and the evolving values of its adherents has precipitated a decline in devotion. The Church's dogmatic views on matters like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, though well-intentioned, have grown archaic in their rigidity. By failing to adapt to the shifting tides of modernity, the Church risks losing its flock to a younger generation that demands a more inclusive and compassionate understanding.\n\nA Church that clings to an outdated worldview risks alienating those who would otherwise seek solace in its teachings. The specter of judgment and intolerance that hangs over certain issues drives away the very souls it seeks to nurture. In an era where the boundaries of acceptance are expanding, the Church's inflexibility appears as a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe prohibition on female priests and married clergy only serves to further exacerbate the disconnect. In an age where women hold positions of power and authority in nearly every sphere, the notion that they are somehow less suited to the priesthood seems anachronistic. And yet, despite this, the Church remains adamant in its stance. The consequences of this rigidity are evident in the dwindling numbers of adherents who feel unwelcome in a community that refuses to evolve.\n\nBut would even the relaxation of these rules have altered the course of events? It is impossible to know, and perhaps it is hubris to assume that such concessions would have been enough to prevent the exodus of devotees. The wounds run too deep, and the wounds of history cannot be so easily healed.\n\nAnd yet, it is precisely this inflexibility that raises the question: why must priests be unmarried? The Church's assertion that they are wedded to God is laudable, but it is a notion that rings hollow when set against the lived experience of those who have dedicated their lives to other pursuits. Why must the clergy be singled out for a life of solitary devotion? In a world where men and women must navigate the complexities of family and career, why must priests be exempt from these same challenges?\n\nIt is a question that speaks to the very heart of the Church's identity. Does it truly believe that its adherents are bound to a higher calling, one that supersedes the demands of the flesh? Or does it merely cling to a tradition that has outlived its purpose? The answer to this question will determine the course of the Church's future, and whether it will find a way to reclaim its relevance in a world that is rapidly leaving it behind.",
            "The existence of two souls bound in love is not a choice. It is an unyielding condition, an inescapable truth that defies the strictures of societal norms. I do not pretend to be an authority on the matter, but I do know this: that the manner in which one is born is not a decision, but a fate. We are each born with a certain inclination, a certain affinity, a certain unshakeable sense of self. The choice, if it can be called that, lies not in the heart's allegiance, but in the world's acceptance.\n\nTo deny two souls the right to consecrate their love, to bind themselves in matrimony, is to deny the inherent dignity of their existence. It is to imply that their love is somehow aberrant, somehow less authentic than the love between two souls of opposite sexes. I do not believe this to be the case. I believe that love knows no bounds, no distinctions, no limitations. It is a force that transcends the petty constraints of human convention.\n\nThe federal government, with its erstwhile authority, should not interfere in the private lives of its citizens. The issue of same-sex marriage is not a matter of national security, nor is it a question of moral rectitude. It is a question of basic human rights, of the freedom to love without fear of reprisal or persecution. The government should not seek to impose its will upon those who would seek to love as they are. It should not seek to dictate the terms of their existence.\n\nUltimately, the question of same-sex marriage is a simple one: should we not allow two souls to love as they are, to bind themselves together in the bond of matrimony, free from the constraints of societal expectation? I believe that we should. The world may view their love as aberrant, but I do not. I see it for what it is: a testament to the human spirit, a testament to the enduring power of love in all its forms.",
            "In the desolate expanse of our society, a fundamental question lingers, a specter that haunts the fringes of our collective conscience: the legalization of gay marriage. The wind howls through the barren lands, whipping up dust devils of ignorance and prejudice, as we stumble through the wasteland of our moral ambiguities.\n\nIt is a notion that has long been shrouded in an impenetrable haze, a mystery waiting to be unraveled. Many claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, a notion that is as baseless as the ash that blankets the earth. For what is a family, truly? Is it not two souls bound together by love and commitment, regardless of the intricacies of their relationship? Is it not a bond that transcends the petty squabbles of society, a union that speaks to the very essence of human connection?\n\nBut the proponents of this antiquated view cling to their biases, their arguments as hollow as the shells of the wind-blasted trees that line our roads. They claim that gay couples are somehow less worthy of recognition, that their love is an aberration, a deviation from the norm. But what is normal, truly? Is it not the pursuit of happiness, the yearning for connection that defines us as human beings? And is not love the very fabric that weaves our lives together?\n\nThe statistics are clear: gay couples exhibit the same rates of success, the same factors contributing to satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts. They are not asking for the right to wed in a church, but for a simple marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the very government that claims to represent us all. Why, then, must we deny them this fundamental right? Is it not a matter of fairness, of equality? Or are we content to live in a society where some are more equal than others?\n\nThe segregation of separate but unequal is a hollow argument, a feeble attempt to justify the injustices that we inflict upon one another. We speak of morality, of the teachings of our churches, but do we not risk hypocrisy when we allow our personal beliefs to dictate the laws of our land? Can we truly claim to be a just society when we deny the rights of a segment of our population simply because of their sexual orientation?\n\nAnd what of the children, those precious innocents who are caught in the crossfire of our prejudices? Do we not risk inflicting upon them a lifetime of pain and suffering by denying their parents the rights and privileges that we take for granted? The American Psychological Association has spoken, and their words are clear: the claims of psychological damage are unfounded, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nAs we stumble through this desolate landscape, we would do well to remember that our opinions are not the only ones that matter. We would do well to listen to the institutions that have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge, to the research and studies that have shed light on this issue. For in the end, it is not our personal biases that will decide the fate of gay marriage, but our collective willingness to recognize the inherent value of every human being.\n\nLet us not be swayed by the winds of ignorance, but rather by the gentle breeze of compassion and understanding. Let us walk the narrow path of justice, and let us ensure that our society is a place where love knows no bounds, where every individual is treated with dignity and respect. For in the end, it is not the laws that we make, but the hearts that we hold that truly define us as human beings.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy, where the fluorescent lights hum a monotonous dirge, I toil in the sweltering summer months. The smell of antiseptic wafts through the air, a constant reminder of the fragility of life. Yet, amidst this sterile backdrop, I find myself pondering the oft-maligned subject of illicit substances. \n\nJust as the law's restrictive grasp cannot deny the medicinal virtues of certain controlled substances, such as oxycodone or Vicodin, so too must we not dismiss the potential benefits of cannabis. The notion that a drug's illegality somehow negates its utility is a fallacy, a product of societal taboo rather than scientific fact. \n\nAs a pharmacy technician, I've witnessed firsthand the responsible use of prohibited substances in medical contexts. Why, then, do we not extend the same consideration to marijuana? The parallels between the two, though imperfect, are striking. Like alcohol, marijuana's abuse can lead to deleterious consequences; yet, just as we do not outlaw the latter, we should not hastily condemn the former. \n\nPerhaps the key lies in a gradual, measured approach, rather than an abrupt shift in policy. By first dismantling the stigmatized image surrounding marijuana, we may foster a more responsible attitude towards its use. The vilification of this substance has created a misconception, one that obscures its potential therapeutic benefits. By acknowledging these advantages, we may yet unlock a new frontier in medicine. \n\nBut alas, the ingrained prejudices run deep. The specter of heroin and cocaine looms large, casting a dark shadow over marijuana's reputation. It is a stubborn stain, one that requires time, patience, and a willingness to reexamine our assumptions. Only then can we hope to transcend the haze of misconception and unlock the truth behind this oft-maligned substance.",
            "In a world that has shed its staidness, the church has undergone a metamorphosis, adapting to the twenty-first century with a newfound flexibility. No longer a bastion of rigidity, it has begun to shed the strictures of its former self, its once-imposing façade now worn and weathered by the whispers of time.\n\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I am reminded of the church as it was in my youth – a place of solemnity and reverence, where the air was thick with the scent of sanctity and the rustle of starched fabric. Every Sunday, I donned my Sunday best – a demure dress, matching shoes, and a purse to match – and joined my friends at the private school I attended on weekends. The ritual was a comforting one, a sense of predictability that anchored me in a world that seemed to be spinning ever more rapidly.\n\nBut as I grew older, I noticed a subtle yet profound change. The church, once a bastion of tradition, began to succumb to the zeitgeist of a more casual era. The teenage mass, a innovation that sought to engage the younger generation, was a telling sign of the times. Services were now neatly condensed into thirty minutes, a fleeting snapshot of devotion in an increasingly harried world. The once-formal attire gave way to a more relaxed, even casual, dress code. Summer Sundays saw beachwear creeping into the pews, a testament to the church's willingness to adapt.\n\nAs I observe this shift, I am struck by the essence of the institution. The church, like the world around it, is a reflection of humanity's evolving values. It is a place where tradition and innovation coexist, where the sacred and the mundane intersect. And yet, despite this adaptability, the church remains a cipher, an enigma that continues to elude my understanding.\n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I am reminded of the complexity of human nature. The notion that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these atrocities is a simplistic one. Pedophilia, I believe, is a product of genetics, a deeply ingrained aspect of an individual's makeup. It is not a choice, a vice that can be eradicated through marriage or any other means. The church, like any institution, is a reflection of humanity at its worst and best. While it is true that some priests have been accused of abuse, it is also true that many have dedicated their lives to selfless service.\n\nThe example of Seventh Heaven, a denomination that allows its ministers to marry, serves as a counterpoint to the Catholic Church's stance. Yet, it also highlights the individual's choice to pursue a particular faith or vocation. If an individual's desires are at odds with the requirements of their faith, perhaps it is time to reevaluate their commitment.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers. The Catholic Church, like the world around it, is a tapestry of contradictions – a place of beauty and ugliness, of light and darkness. Its evolution is a reflection of humanity's own, a slow and halting process that grapples with the complexities of existence.",
            "The ashes of the century still lingered, a cold and festering wound that refused to heal. The echoes of a calamitous day still lingered, a hollowed-out refrain that seemed to seep into every pore. The wounds of September's brutal birth pangs still bled, a festering sore that had yet to scab. The nation's collective psyche remained a maelstrom of anger, a churning sea of discontent that threatened to engulf all in its path. The winds of war had been fanned by the whispers of a pretext, a thin veil of deceit that had been woven to conceal the true intent of those who held the reins.\n\nThe Bush administration, a cabal of men driven by a zealot's fervor, had set the nation ablaze with a war of choice, a conflict born of hubris and a desire for dominance. The lies had been legion, a litany of half-truths and outright fabrications that had been peddled to the public with a zeal that bordered on the fanatical. The notion that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to the nation's security, that he harbored weapons of mass destruction, was a myth, a chimera conjured by the fevered imagination of those who would seek to justify their actions.\n\nAnd yet, even now, the wounds ran deep, a festering sore that refused to heal. The Constitution, that sacred document that had been the cornerstone of the nation's foundation, had been trampled, its principles and ideals cast aside like so much rubbish. The disregard for the rule of law, the flaunting of power, had become a hallmark of the administration, a litany of abuses that had been perpetrated with impunity.\n\nAs the nation teetered on the brink of collapse, the question remained: what had been the true intention of the war? Was it a quest for oil, a desire to secure the nation's energy needs, or was it something more sinister, a bid for dominance in a world that was rapidly changing? The answer, much like the truth, remained shrouded in mystery, a enigma that refused to yield to the probing of reason.\n\nThe situation in Iraq, a quagmire of chaos and confusion, seemed to be spiraling out of control. The interim government, a fragile entity, teetered on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty threatened by the very nations that sought to prop it up. The Parliament, a body supposedly empowered to govern, was a mere shell of its former self, a hollow vessel devoid of purpose or direction. The radicals, a cauldron of dissent and discontent, simmered just below the surface, waiting to boil over and engulf all in their path.\n\nAnd yet, even in the midst of this maelstrom, a glimmer of hope remained. A coalition of nations, a patchwork of interests and ideologies, sought to impose order on the chaos, to bring a modicum of stability to a nation on the brink of collapse. But would it be enough? Or would the very attempts to impose order only serve to exacerbate the problem, to sow the seeds of discord and strife that would ultimately lead to a bitter harvest of blood and tears?\n\nOnly time would tell, but one thing was certain: the wounds of the past would not easily heal, and the future, like the present, remained shrouded in uncertainty, a dark and foreboding mist that threatened to engulf all in its path.",
            "He spoke in hushed tones, his words lost in the haze of indecision.  I'm not sure where to begin, he said, the words like ashes on his tongue.  The War in Iraq, a thing that had consumed the air, the news, the very fabric of life.  He thought of it as a beast, a thing that gnawed at the edges of the world, leaving only ruin in its wake.\n\nIt was a war that had never been declared, a shadowy thing that lurched forward with a hunger for power and for oil.  They had gone in with guns and bombs, with a promise of democracy and freedom.  But it had become a thing of ash and dust, a desolate landscape of burned cities and shattered lives.\n\nHe thought of the families, the sons and daughters who had gone to fight, leaving behind the warmth of home and the comfort of loved ones.  Their faces etched in his mind like the faces of the dead.  The ones who had come back, their eyes haunted, their hearts heavy with the weight of what they had seen.\n\nHe thought of the people of Iraq, their culture shattered, their lives torn apart by the very forces that had come to help.  The Al-Kaida, a hydra-like thing that seemed to grow stronger with each passing day.  Their hatred for the United States a thing that deepened with each passing moment.\n\nHe didn't know what to think, what to feel.  It was a morass of conflicting emotions, a tangle of threads that he couldn't seem to untangle.  He felt a sense of responsibility, a sense of duty to the boys and girls who had gone to fight.  But he also felt a sense of shame, a sense of guilt for the lives that had been lost, the lives that had been torn apart.\n\nThe words tumbled out of him like a confession, a prayer, a plea for understanding.  It was a war that had become a thing of ash and dust, a desolate landscape of burned cities and shattered lives.  He didn't know if it was worth it, if the cost had been worth the gain.  All he knew was that it was a thing that would haunt him, a thing that would stay with him for the rest of his days.\n\nThe words trailed off, lost in the silence.  He was left with only questions, only doubts.  The War in Iraq, a thing that had consumed the air, the news, the very fabric of life.  A thing that would haunt him, a thing that would stay with him forever.",
            "The notion of imposing a law, a declaration of what is permissible or not, strikes a discordant note within me. It is a notion that borders on the hubris of those who would seek to impose their will upon the realm of the sacred, of the churches, where faith and conviction hold sway. The constitution, that enduring testament to the principles of our nation, speaks of the separation of church and state, a clear and unmistakable demarcation between the realms of the temporal and the eternal. To tamper with this balance would be to invite chaos, to upset the delicate equipoise that has been established.\n\nThe churches, not the government, are the proper arbiters of such matters. It is they who have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of the divine, who have walked the hallowed paths of faith for centuries. The government, with its pretensions to omniscience, should not usurp the authority of the churches. To do so would be to elevate the mundane over the sacred, to confuse the roles of the temporal and the eternal.\n\nThe notion of an amendment, of a law imposed by the hand of the state, would be a perversion of the principles that our constitution enshrines. It would be a restriction, not of the government, but of the people, a stifling of their freedom to worship, to believe as they see fit. And for what purpose? To impose the will of one church, one creed, upon the many? It is a notion devoid of merit, a relic of a outdated thinking that would seek to impose a narrow, dogmatic view upon a pluralistic society.\n\nI do not see the rationale behind such an amendment, save for the personal convictions of a few. The president's actions, in pushing for such a law, smack of a disregard for the separation of church and state, a willingness to impose his own views upon the nation, in direct contravention of the principles enshrined in our constitution. It is a step down a perilous path, one that would lead us further down the road of intolerance, of restriction, of the stifling of individual freedom.\n\nIn truth, I see little reason for such an amendment. It would do little to improve our economy, our society, our lives. In fact, it might have a negative impact, stifling the very freedoms that our nation was founded upon. The government should not be involved in this issue, should not seek to impose its will upon the churches. The people, in their diversity, should be free to worship as they see fit, to follow the dictates of their hearts, not the edicts of the state.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should not be involved in this matter. The churches, not the government, should be the arbiters of such issues. The constitution, that sacred document, speaks clearly and unequivocally on this matter. Let us not forget its words, let us not forget the principles that have guided us thus far. Let us preserve the separation of church and state, and allow the people to worship as they see fit, free from the interference of the state.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict born of deceit and hubris. It was a war that began as a shroud of secrecy, a tangled web of half-truths and misdirection. The government's justifications, a whispered litany of lies, designed to stir the passions of the American people, to cloak the invasion in a mantle of righteousness. The echoes of September 11th, a distant memory, a false pretext for the blood-soaked sands of Mesopotamia. The drums of war beat out a rhythm of fear and anger, a siren's song that lured the nation into the abyss.\n\nWe were a people, lost and searching, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own self-importance. We were told that the Iraqi government was a monster, a grotesque and malevolent force that threatened our very way of life. But was it not a lie? Were we not being deceived, led astray by the insidious whisperings of our own leaders? The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a cautionary tale of a war that had been lost, a war that had claimed the lives of countless young men, a war that had left a nation scarred and bitter.\n\nAnd yet, we walked into the void, blind and unprepared, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own arrogance. We removed the government, leaving a power vacuum, a chasm of chaos that would swallow us whole. The aftermath, a nightmarish tapestry of blood and fire, a litany of death and despair. The insurgency, a hydra-headed beast, a creature that would not be slain. We fought the citizens, the very people we claimed to liberate, and we were defeated.\n\nWe were not prepared for the consequences of our actions, nor did we understand the nature of the enemy we faced. We were naive, blinded by our own righteousness, our own self-importance. We were not fighting an army, but a people, a people who refused to be subjugated, a people who would not be silenced. The war in Iraq, a repeat of the mistakes of the past, a war that would haunt us for generations to come.\n\nWe are still there, mired in the quagmire, our casualties mounting, our dreams of a free and democratic Iraq slipping further and further away. The oil, a siren's song, a lure that beckoned us to the abyss. The true reasons for the war, shrouded in secrecy, hidden from the prying eyes of the public. The lies, the half-truths, the misdirection, a cleverly woven tapestry of deceit.\n\nAnd so we are stuck, trapped in a cycle of violence and fear, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own hubris. We are a people, lost and searching, our way forward shrouded in uncertainty. The war in Iraq, a dark and foreboding presence, a shadow that looms over our collective conscience. We can only hope that it will end soon, that the bloodshed will cease, and that peace will return to that troubled land.",
            "The thought stirs like a flame in the dark, a flickering thing that refuses to be extinguished. I am drawn to it, this notion of love without bounds, of two souls entwined in a dance of devotion. It is a notion that has long been a part of me, a whispered promise to myself, a gentle urging to break free from the constraints of a world that seeks to define us by the whims of others.\n\nIn the stillness of night, when the world is hushed and the shadows reign, I am reminded of the fragility of life, the ephemeral nature of our existence. And yet, in this fleeting moment, I find solace in the knowledge that love knows no bounds, that it can transcend the confines of societal expectations, of familial norms, of ancient traditions. It is a love that is raw, unbridled, and unapologetic, a love that refuses to be silenced by the whispers of doubt and fear.\n\nI have always believed that love is a fundamental right, a basic human necessity that should be granted to all, regardless of the labels we assign to it. It is a right that should be protected, cherished, and upheld, not denied or diminished by the arrogance of those who would seek to impose their will upon others. For love is not a choice, it is a calling, a primal urge that cannot be tamed or controlled.\n\nIn this bleak and barren world, where the winds howl and the ash falls like a shroud, I find hope in the resilience of the human spirit. I see it in the way two people, bound by love, can weather the storms, can face the darkness, and can emerge stronger, more steadfast, and more unbreakable. It is a love that is forged in the fire of adversity, tempered by the trials of a world that seeks to tear us apart.\n\nAnd so, I stand steadfast in my conviction, unwavering in my resolve. I believe that love knows no bounds, that it is a fundamental right, a basic human necessity that should be upheld and cherished. I believe that love is a flame that burns bright, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of it. And I believe that it is a love that should be free to flourish, unencumbered by the constraints of societal expectations, unshackled by the chains of oppression.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the laws that govern us, nor the politics that divide us, nor the norms that constrain us, that truly matter. It is the love that we share, the love that we give, and the love that we receive. It is the love that burns within us, a flame that flickers brightly, a light that shines brightly in the darkness.",
            "He'd learned the lesson of the voided spaces where words reside. Where thoughts without borders spread like ash on the wind. When something was placed in the public expanse, it lost all vestige of sanctuary. It became a thing without bounds, a thing that could not be recalled. A thing that would forever bear the weight of perception. As an RA, he'd witnessed it firsthand - the careless utterances, the misplaced words that could spark a fire. The bulletin that arrived at the school, its origin unknown, a harbinger of dread. The friends who'd stumbled upon it, their faces etched with concern. The search for the source, the parsing of intent. The line between jest and gravity, forever blurred.\n\nThe internet, a vast and unforgiving plain, where words were currency and reputation was the cost. No refuge from the gaze of the many, where the private was an illusion. When you entered the public sphere, you surrendered to the whims of others. You couldn't dictate how they'd receive your words, or what they'd make of them. The school officials, bound by duty, had to act on the information they gathered. They couldn't ignore the whispers of a potentially volatile situation. The question, always, was whether the intentions behind the words were genuine or a ruse, a sociology experiment gone awry.\n\nHe thought back to the incident at school, where a student's Facebook page had been scrutinized, its contents deemed a cause for concern. The boundaries between private and public had been breached, and the consequences had been severe. The realization had struck him - the internet was a realm without borders, where the notion of privacy was a myth. If you didn't want your words to be seen, don't put them out there. If you didn't want someone to think a certain way, you couldn't control their thoughts. Schools, he believed, shouldn't befriend their students on social media platforms, shouldn't snoop through their online presence. But if concerns were raised, and the warning signs were heeded, the school had a duty to act. The line between monitoring and invasion of privacy was thin, but when danger loomed, it was a distinction that mattered little.\n\nHe'd learned to be mindful of his words, to consider the reach they might have. To think before posting, before sharing. The world, it seemed, was a fragile tapestry, where a single misstep could unravel the entire fabric. And in this vast and unforgiving expanse, he'd do well to remember the lesson of the voided spaces - that words, once spoken, could not be recalled, and their consequences, forever unbound.",
            "In the wasteland of reason, the war has been reduced to a hollow shell of its former purpose. What was once a crusade to restore democracy in a foreign land has devolved into a protracted exercise in futility. The original intent, to bring light to a land shrouded in tyranny, has been lost in the dust of time. The ghosts of George Bush's past animosities with Saddam Hussein still linger, casting a shadow over the true motivations behind the war.\n\nThe initial spark, a beacon of hope in the darkness, has flickered out, leaving behind a smoldering ember of justification. The war, once a clarion call to freedom, has become a Sisyphean task, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and despair. The first skirmishes, a decisive blow for democracy, have given way to a drawn-out stalemate, a war of attrition that has drained the lifeblood from our economy.\n\nWe were once driven by a noble purpose, a desire to liberate a people from the shackles of oppression. But that purpose has been eroded, worn down by the relentless tides of time. We have lost sight of the initial goal, and now we are mired in a quagmire of our own making. The war has become a self-perpetuating machine, a monster that feeds on our resources, our lives, and our very soul.\n\nThe cost is staggering, a drain on our economy that could be better spent on the pressing needs of our own people. The wars on poverty, education, and healthcare cry out for attention, but our treasure is squandered on a conflict that has long since lost its way. We are bleeding our treasury dry, sacrificing our own citizens on the altar of a cause that has been lost.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to a simple question: what is the true cost of our actions? Is it not time to acknowledge that the war has been a failure, a Pyrrhic victory that has achieved nothing but the perpetuation of a cycle of violence? We must confront the reality of our situation, and acknowledge that it is time to bring this sense of purpose to an end. The war has outlived its usefulness, and it is time to let it go.",
            "A question hung unspoken, like a thing of fragile glass suspended in the air, waiting to shatter. It had to do with the tracings of the past, the echoes of moments lived and lost, and the fragile boundaries of a person's private self. He recalled the words of an old man, a sage from a bygone era, who said that once a thing was placed upon the altar of the internet, it was as though it had been cast to the winds, subject to the whims of an unfeeling world. And so it was with Myspace, a digital realm where the veil of anonymity was but a thin membrane, easily pierced by the prying eyes of others.\n\nHe had heard the tale of a young soul, a wanderer in the digital wilderness, who had stumbled upon a profile, a digital shrine to a person's innermost thoughts and desires. And in that moment, a life was saved, a potential catastrophe averted. Yet, the boy's words hung in the air, a query that spoke to the very heart of the issue: was it right to expect that others would watch over us, to shield us from the dangers that lurked in the shadows of the net?\n\nHe thought of the boy's words, of the fragile balance between freedom and safety, between the desire for anonymity and the need for protection. It was a delicate dance, a precarious tightrope walked by those who ventured into the digital realm. And the consequences of a misstep? Ah, those were as uncertain as the wind that whipped through the dead trees, as ephemeral as the ashes that swirled in the breeze.\n\nIn the end, it was a question that begged for no easy answer, a riddle without a solution. For in the world of the internet, the lines between public and private were blurred, the boundaries between freedom and surveillance ever-shifting. And so, the boy's question hung in the air, a haunting reminder of the fragility of the human heart, and the uncertain future that lay ahead.",
            "The ghosts of war still linger in the ash-scarred landscape. The Iraq War, a calamity of unyielding proportions, continues to haunt us, a specter of hubris and miscalculation. To speak of it now feels like an exercise in futility, a vain attempt to grasp the ungraspable. And yet, I am drawn to the void, compelled to confront the ruin that we have wrought.\n\nLike a man wandering through a desolate landscape, I find myself torn between the weight of conviction and the crushing weight of doubt. I was against the war from the beginning, yet now it seems almost irrelevant, a fact lost in the din of history. The polls, a cacophony of numbers and opinions, scream in unison: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world, eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops, all concurring in their assessment: this war was a grave mistake.\n\nThe administration's recklessness, a product of its own myopia, blinds it to the inherent contradictions of its actions. The Middle East, a cauldron of ancient animosities and cultural fault lines, defies the simplistic notions of democracy and progress. The notion that we can impose our will upon this complex tapestry, that we can somehow \"bring democracy\" to a region where it has never taken root, is a conceit born of arrogance and ignorance.\n\nSaddam, a monstrous figure, may have been a bad man, but his ousting has unleashed a maelstrom of chaos, a quagmire from which we may never extricate ourselves. The administration's talking points, a jumble of half-truths and convenient fictions, fail to convince. The problems of withdrawal, they claim, are too dire, too complex. But I see no legitimate reason to stay. The voices of the Iraqis, the people we claim to be saving, cry out for our departure. Eighty percent, a staggering majority, demand our withdrawal within the year. And what of the quarter who urge us to leave now? Might they not know better than we, the would-be saviors, what is best for their own land?\n\nIf we leave, we can absolve ourselves of responsibility for the disaster that has unfolded. We can say, with a modicum of truth, that we were forced to withdraw by the will of the Iraqi people. But even this weak excuse will not suffice. We will never be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, not now, not ever. All we can hope for is to mitigate the damage, to leave with a semblance of dignity, rather than the ignominy of continued occupation.\n\nAnd so I ask: what now? How do we extricate ourselves from this festering wound? The answer, like the war itself, remains elusive, a mirage on the horizon of history. But one thing is certain: we must leave, and we must leave soon. The ghosts of war will not rest until we do.",
            "The air was heavy with the weight of unspoken truths, like the faint scent of rain on a dry earth. The fire of equality still smoldered, a flickering flame that danced with the wind of societal norms. I believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, a cancer that seeps into the marrow of our being. It is not a question of men and women alone, but rather the consequence of a culture that has been shaped by the past.\n\nIn the field of work, the glass ceiling still looms, a reminder that even with equality on the books, it is a struggle to shatter the silence of a legacy that reveres the status quo. Women, in particular, face a daunting task in piercing the veil of prejudice, for it is a world that has been crafted to favor the masculine. They strive to reach the pinnacle of success, only to find themselves hemmed in by the fragile glass that separates them from the upper echelons of power.\n\nBut it is not just women who face this trial. Men, too, are bound by the chains of societal expectation. Those who choose to stay at home, to nurture and care for their children, are met with skepticism and scorn, their masculinity called into question. The world looks upon them with a mixture of disdain and confusion, unable to comprehend the notion of a man who puts family above the altar of profit.\n\nIn the fashion industry, the stereotypes are even more pronounced. Men who dare to venture into this realm are often met with suspicion, their seriousness doubted, their passion questioned. They are seen as anomalies, outsiders who do not belong, their masculinity suspect because of their association with a world that is deemed feminine.\n\nBut change is a slow and tortuous process. It is a journey that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to challenge the status quo. We have come a long way, to be sure, but we still have far to go. The fight for equality is not a battle to be won overnight, but a marathon that demands our collective effort.\n\nPerhaps the key to progress lies not in forcing the issue, but in promoting the qualities that define us as individuals. By celebrating the strengths and weaknesses of those who are often stereotyped, we can begin to break down the walls that separate us. We must recognize that intelligence and worth are not solely the domain of the well-spoken, but rather the province of those who dare to be different.\n\nUltimately, the fight for equality is a journey that knows no bounds, a path that winds through the complexities of our collective experience. It is a road that is fraught with obstacles, but one that holds the promise of a brighter tomorrow. As we move forward, let us not forget that change is a gradual process, one that requires our collective effort and our unwavering commitment to the cause.\n\nIn the end, it is not just about men and women, but about the humanity that unites us all. It is about recognizing that we are all equal, that we are all deserving of respect and dignity, regardless of our background or our profession. And it is this understanding that will ultimately guide us toward a future where equality is not just a dream, but a reality.",
            "The understanding of the legal landscape is that they did not completely legalize it, but rather decriminalized it, stripping it of its former status as a felony charge. It is now akin to a traffic infraction, one that garners a citation rather than a full-blown arrest and prolonged court proceedings. Those who are caught are not burdened with the weight of a formal conviction, a concern that had previously hampered many who worried about the long-term implications on their future prospects, such as employment and social standing. Yet, there exists a counterargument that the fiscal burden of policing and prosecuting such offenses is considerable. The cost of apprehending, detaining, and processing individuals, only to release them later, can be a significant drain on municipal resources. Many financially strained municipalities hesitate to adopt such a measure, even if it would free up capital for more pressing needs.\n\nHowever, in places where public opinion leans more liberal, like Denver, decriminalization has become a matter of course. The resulting windfall of revenue has been redirected toward vital community programs, such as education, social services for the elderly, and feeding initiatives for those in need. It is a pragmatic approach that acknowledges the dual nature of this substance – its potential benefits and drawbacks. While its widespread availability might prove a concern, the financial and social implications of its prohibition cannot be ignored.\n\nOne of the lingering reservations about marijuana legalization pertains to its societal acceptance. Some worry that its widespread availability would undermine the cultural taboo surrounding it, leading to public use and, by extension, impaired driving. However, it is worth noting that alcohol, another substance with well-documented impairing effects, has yet to be fully eradicated from our society. Each substance has its unique impact on individuals, influenced by factors such as personality and life choices.\n\nModeration and self-control are key, as people's reactions to substances can vary significantly. It is challenging to generalize about the effects of marijuana, as individuals respond differently. Both alcohol and marijuana have negative consequences, and while some individuals can navigate these substances with ease, others may struggle. This nuanced understanding highlights the complexity of the issue, underscoring the importance of continued dialogue and informed decision-making.",
            "The notion of adhering to tradition is a weight that settles heavy upon the soul. Like the slow accumulation of ash on a weathered stone, the rituals and practices of a bygone era can suffocate the very life that seeks to breathe within them. The Catholic Church, an institution steeped in the rich soil of tradition, stands as a testament to this assertion. Its dogma, a labyrinth of doctrine and teaching, binds the faithful to a strict adherence to the ways of old.\n\nYet, like a river that refuses to be contained, change always seeks to seep into the cracks of the established order. The Church, too, has been shaped by the currents of time, its own waters churning with the disparate voices of its followers. The tension between tradition and adaptability is a chasm that yawns wide, threatening to swallow the very foundations of the institution.\n\nA passage of time, a span of years, a silence of decades – and the world shifts, ever so imperceptibly. The Church, too, must shift, or risk being consumed by the very traditions it seeks to uphold. And yet, like a tree that clings to its ancient roots, it resists the gentle tug of progress. The result is a disconnect, a schism that runs deep, a gulf that separates the teachings of the Church from the lived experience of its followers.\n\nConsider, if you will, the doctrine of love. \"Love thy neighbor as thyself,\" a teaching that echoes through the halls of scripture. And yet, the practice of the Church often seems to falter in its application of this very principle. The prohibition against marrying outside the faith, the rejection of those who do not conform to the established norms – these are but a few examples of the disconnect that exists between the teachings of the Church and the lived reality of its followers.\n\nThe issue of priestly marriage is a case in point. Some argue that allowing priests to wed would help to curb the scourge of pedophilia that has ravaged the Church. But is this not a simplistic solution, one that fails to address the deeper rot that festers within the institution? The abuse of power, the corruption of the sacred – these are not solved by the mere act of marriage. They require a fundamental shift in the way the Church views itself, a recognition that its teachings must be lived, not merely recited.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution that will save us, but the individuals who comprise it. It is not the tradition that will heal the wounds of the past, but the willingness to confront them head-on. As the world outside continues to shift and change, the Church must do the same, lest it be left behind, a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of a time when tradition was more important than the lives of its followers.",
            "A thing that weighs upon my mind, a matter that defies easy resolution. I find myself torn, suspended between the crevices of a dichotomy. The line separating church and state, a divide so fine it's nigh impossible to traverse. And the notion of marriage, a concept as slippery as a snake through the grass. It's a puzzle, a riddle, a thing that shifts and writhes like a living thing.\n\nI'm not one to take a stand, to stake my claim on a particular side of the fence. But I will say this: the boundaries between civil union and sacrament blur and blend like the hues of a sunset. Marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil contract to others. And what of the government's role in all this? Should it concern itself with the sanctity of the union, or merely the legalities? I think it should be the latter. The state's domain is one of law, not dogma.\n\nThe fact that gay marriage is a topic of debate at all speaks to the intractability of the issue. It's a tempest in a teapot, a storm that rages and churns but ultimately resolves into nothing. And yet, it's a tempest that refuses to dissipate, a maelstrom that draws in the unwary. The constitution, a document of grand import, is not a vessel for the whims of the masses. It's a framework, a structure that guides us, not a plaything for the passions of the day.\n\nTo amend the constitution for the sake of banning gay marriage is a notion that strikes me as... misguided. A constitutional amendment is a solemn thing, a weighty matter that should not be taken lightly. It's a decision that should be approached with caution, with trepidation. And yet, in this case, I fear it's a decision that's driven more by emotion than reason.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a home where the words of scripture held sway, where the teachings of the Lord were the guiding force behind every decision. Yet, as I've grown and navigated the complexities of the world, I've found myself drawn to the fringes of that faith, questioning the certainties I once held dear. The matter of homosexuality, in particular, has caused me to wrestle with the fine lines that separate conviction and compassion.\n\nI've had the privilege of forming friendships with individuals who walk a path I don't fully understand, and in doing so, I've come to see the humanity in their struggles. I don't pretend to comprehend the intricacies of their experiences, but I do know that they are not so different from my own. We are all seekers, stumbling through the darkness, searching for a glimmer of light.\n\nAs I've grappled with this issue, I've come to the realization that I don't share the same fervor as some of my contemporaries. I don't see the world in binary terms, where one choice is the only acceptable path. Instead, I believe that the complexities of human emotion and experience demand a more nuanced approach. I think that individuals should have the freedom to live their lives as they see fit, as long as they're not harming others.\n\nThe notion that our leaders should dictate how we live our private lives feels suffocating. The idea that one person's perspective should be imposed upon an entire nation strikes me as a recipe for division and strife. I believe that each state should have the autonomy to determine its own values and laws, rather than relying on a single individual to make decisions for the masses.\n\nIt's a matter of personal responsibility, of living with the consequences of our choices. If I choose to reside in a state that has chosen to legalize gay marriage, then I must respect their decision, even if it differs from my own. I don't believe it's my place to dictate how others live their lives, as long as they're not infringing upon my own rights.\n\nThe notion that a single leader, like President Bush, should have the authority to impose his will on the nation feels anachronistic. He doesn't live in every state; he doesn't bear the weight of every decision that affects the people of this land. His term in office is finite, and when it ends, the decision will ultimately rest with those who come after him.\n\nIn the end, it's up to each individual state to chart its own course, to navigate the complexities of human experience. It's a messy, imperfect process, but it's one that acknowledges the diversity of our nation and the autonomy of its people. I believe that's where true freedom lies – not in the dictates of a single leader, but in the choices we make as individuals, as communities, and as a nation.",
            "The world of the internet, a vast and unfettered expanse where the gaze of the public is unfettered. A bulletin board, a forum for the airing of one's thoughts and intentions, where the pixelated eyes of the world converge to witness the unfolding drama of the self. And yet, the notion of privacy, that fragile and tenuous thing, is lost in the ether like autumn leaves on a gusty day.\n\nThe school officials, those guardians of the academic halls, had every right to peer into the recesses of a student's digital life. For in the public realm, all is fair game. The internet, a labyrinth of interconnected threads, beckons the curious and the prurient alike to explore its depths. And those who venture there do so with the knowledge that their every move is being watched, their every thought laid bare for all to see.\n\nBut what of the school's responsibility to safeguard its charges? Is it not the duty of those who oversee the halls of learning to ensure the well-being of their pupils? To shield them from the dangers that lurk in the shadows of the digital world, where the past and present converge in a maelstrom of consequences. The Columbine incident, a dark and foreboding specter, haunts the dreams of educators, a reminder of the potential for violence that lurks in the hearts of the young.\n\nThe school officials, then, were merely doing their duty, seeking to avert the catastrophe that could have befallen upon them. By monitoring the online lives of their students, they acted to prevent the very thing they feared - the unleashing of chaos and destruction. And in this, they stood as the sentinels of a fragile and besieged institution, ever vigilant in their pursuit of a safer, more secure environment.\n\nBut what of the individual's right to privacy, that cherished and oft-abused notion? Does not the student's expectation of anonymity in the digital realm take precedence over the school's responsibility to safeguard its charges? The answer, much like the digital footprints we leave behind, is a fleeting and ephemeral thing, lost in the vast and uncaring expanse of the internet.\n\nIn the end, it is not the internet that is the problem, but rather our own expectations of it. We venture into this vast and unfettered expanse with the hope of connection, of community, and of expression. But we do so at the risk of being seen, of being watched, and of being judged. And it is in this tension that we find the crux of the matter - the delicate balance between the pursuit of self and the need for safety.",
            "A vast and desolate emptiness had settled within me, a chasm carved by the events of nine eleven. At first, I was a vessel for the fervor that swept the land, my heart afire with a desire for retribution. The wounds of that day still lingered, a festering sore that seemed to cry out for salve. I was convinced that invasion was the answer, that the imposition of our will would bring order to the chaos. But as the months passed, a creeping doubt began to take hold. We had charged into the fray without a clear plan, our hearts heavy with emotion and our minds clouded by anger. We spoke of liberation, but did we truly understand the complexities of the land we sought to shape?\n\nThe people we sought to free were a tapestry woven from many threads, threads that were often at odds with one another. They were a people prone to savagery, their wars a brutal and unyielding thing. And I began to wonder if we were merely pawns in their game, if our presence was little more than a catalyst for their own internecine conflicts. The more I considered it, the more I came to believe that our intervention had been a mistake, a folly born of passion rather than prudence. We had attempted to impose our will upon a people who would not be swayed, who would not be changed. And in the end, it was we who were the ones who were changed, our hearts hardened by the experience.\n\nI often think of my uncle's words, spoken on a long-ago day by the lake's edge. He had taught me that the world was a complex and multifaceted thing, that its workings were not always easy to understand. And I began to see that our actions in that far-off land had been a testament to our own ignorance, our own arrogance. We had charged in with guns blazing, convinced of our own righteousness, but in the end, it was we who were left with the wounds.\n\nI do not know what the future holds, but I do know that our presence in that land has been a futile endeavor. We have made progress, to be sure, but it is progress that will not last. The land will continue to be a battleground, a place of bloodshed and strife. And we will be the ones who are left to pick up the pieces, to wonder why we had thought we could change the course of history. It is a lesson I will carry with me for the rest of my days, a reminder of the futility of our endeavors, and the dangers of acting without thought or foresight."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The once-venerable institution of the Catholic Church stands at a crossroads, its waning influence a symptom of a broader malaise. A disconnect between the Church's stance on certain issues and the evolving values of its adherents has precipitated a decline in devotion. The Church's dogmatic views on matters like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, though well-intentioned, have grown archaic in their rigidity. By failing to adapt to the shifting tides of modernity, the Church risks losing its flock to a younger generation that demands a more inclusive and compassionate understanding.\n\nA Church that clings to an outdated worldview risks alienating those who would otherwise seek solace in its teachings. The specter of judgment and intolerance that hangs over certain issues drives away the very souls it seeks to nurture. In an era where the boundaries of acceptance are expanding, the Church's inflexibility appears as a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe prohibition on female priests and married clergy only serves to further exacerbate the disconnect. In an age where women hold positions of power and authority in nearly every sphere, the notion that they are somehow less suited to the priesthood seems anachronistic. And yet, despite this, the Church remains adamant in its stance. The consequences of this rigidity are evident in the dwindling numbers of adherents who feel unwelcome in a community that refuses to evolve.\n\nBut would even the relaxation of these rules have altered the course of events? It is impossible to know, and perhaps it is hubris to assume that such concessions would have been enough to prevent the exodus of devotees. The wounds run too deep, and the wounds of history cannot be so easily healed.\n\nAnd yet, it is precisely this inflexibility that raises the question: why must priests be unmarried? The Church's assertion that they are wedded to God is laudable, but it is a notion that rings hollow when set against the lived experience of those who have dedicated their lives to other pursuits. Why must the clergy be singled out for a life of solitary devotion? In a world where men and women must navigate the complexities of family and career, why must priests be exempt from these same challenges?\n\nIt is a question that speaks to the very heart of the Church's identity. Does it truly believe that its adherents are bound to a higher calling, one that supersedes the demands of the flesh? Or does it merely cling to a tradition that has outlived its purpose? The answer to this question will determine the course of the Church's future, and whether it will find a way to reclaim its relevance in a world that is rapidly leaving it behind.",
            "The existence of two souls bound in love is not a choice. It is an unyielding condition, an inescapable truth that defies the strictures of societal norms. I do not pretend to be an authority on the matter, but I do know this: that the manner in which one is born is not a decision, but a fate. We are each born with a certain inclination, a certain affinity, a certain unshakeable sense of self. The choice, if it can be called that, lies not in the heart's allegiance, but in the world's acceptance.\n\nTo deny two souls the right to consecrate their love, to bind themselves in matrimony, is to deny the inherent dignity of their existence. It is to imply that their love is somehow aberrant, somehow less authentic than the love between two souls of opposite sexes. I do not believe this to be the case. I believe that love knows no bounds, no distinctions, no limitations. It is a force that transcends the petty constraints of human convention.\n\nThe federal government, with its erstwhile authority, should not interfere in the private lives of its citizens. The issue of same-sex marriage is not a matter of national security, nor is it a question of moral rectitude. It is a question of basic human rights, of the freedom to love without fear of reprisal or persecution. The government should not seek to impose its will upon those who would seek to love as they are. It should not seek to dictate the terms of their existence.\n\nUltimately, the question of same-sex marriage is a simple one: should we not allow two souls to love as they are, to bind themselves together in the bond of matrimony, free from the constraints of societal expectation? I believe that we should. The world may view their love as aberrant, but I do not. I see it for what it is: a testament to the human spirit, a testament to the enduring power of love in all its forms.",
            "In the desolate expanse of our society, a fundamental question lingers, a specter that haunts the fringes of our collective conscience: the legalization of gay marriage. The wind howls through the barren lands, whipping up dust devils of ignorance and prejudice, as we stumble through the wasteland of our moral ambiguities.\n\nIt is a notion that has long been shrouded in an impenetrable haze, a mystery waiting to be unraveled. Many claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, a notion that is as baseless as the ash that blankets the earth. For what is a family, truly? Is it not two souls bound together by love and commitment, regardless of the intricacies of their relationship? Is it not a bond that transcends the petty squabbles of society, a union that speaks to the very essence of human connection?\n\nBut the proponents of this antiquated view cling to their biases, their arguments as hollow as the shells of the wind-blasted trees that line our roads. They claim that gay couples are somehow less worthy of recognition, that their love is an aberration, a deviation from the norm. But what is normal, truly? Is it not the pursuit of happiness, the yearning for connection that defines us as human beings? And is not love the very fabric that weaves our lives together?\n\nThe statistics are clear: gay couples exhibit the same rates of success, the same factors contributing to satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts. They are not asking for the right to wed in a church, but for a simple marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the very government that claims to represent us all. Why, then, must we deny them this fundamental right? Is it not a matter of fairness, of equality? Or are we content to live in a society where some are more equal than others?\n\nThe segregation of separate but unequal is a hollow argument, a feeble attempt to justify the injustices that we inflict upon one another. We speak of morality, of the teachings of our churches, but do we not risk hypocrisy when we allow our personal beliefs to dictate the laws of our land? Can we truly claim to be a just society when we deny the rights of a segment of our population simply because of their sexual orientation?\n\nAnd what of the children, those precious innocents who are caught in the crossfire of our prejudices? Do we not risk inflicting upon them a lifetime of pain and suffering by denying their parents the rights and privileges that we take for granted? The American Psychological Association has spoken, and their words are clear: the claims of psychological damage are unfounded, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nAs we stumble through this desolate landscape, we would do well to remember that our opinions are not the only ones that matter. We would do well to listen to the institutions that have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge, to the research and studies that have shed light on this issue. For in the end, it is not our personal biases that will decide the fate of gay marriage, but our collective willingness to recognize the inherent value of every human being.\n\nLet us not be swayed by the winds of ignorance, but rather by the gentle breeze of compassion and understanding. Let us walk the narrow path of justice, and let us ensure that our society is a place where love knows no bounds, where every individual is treated with dignity and respect. For in the end, it is not the laws that we make, but the hearts that we hold that truly define us as human beings.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy, where the fluorescent lights hum a monotonous dirge, I toil in the sweltering summer months. The smell of antiseptic wafts through the air, a constant reminder of the fragility of life. Yet, amidst this sterile backdrop, I find myself pondering the oft-maligned subject of illicit substances. \n\nJust as the law's restrictive grasp cannot deny the medicinal virtues of certain controlled substances, such as oxycodone or Vicodin, so too must we not dismiss the potential benefits of cannabis. The notion that a drug's illegality somehow negates its utility is a fallacy, a product of societal taboo rather than scientific fact. \n\nAs a pharmacy technician, I've witnessed firsthand the responsible use of prohibited substances in medical contexts. Why, then, do we not extend the same consideration to marijuana? The parallels between the two, though imperfect, are striking. Like alcohol, marijuana's abuse can lead to deleterious consequences; yet, just as we do not outlaw the latter, we should not hastily condemn the former. \n\nPerhaps the key lies in a gradual, measured approach, rather than an abrupt shift in policy. By first dismantling the stigmatized image surrounding marijuana, we may foster a more responsible attitude towards its use. The vilification of this substance has created a misconception, one that obscures its potential therapeutic benefits. By acknowledging these advantages, we may yet unlock a new frontier in medicine. \n\nBut alas, the ingrained prejudices run deep. The specter of heroin and cocaine looms large, casting a dark shadow over marijuana's reputation. It is a stubborn stain, one that requires time, patience, and a willingness to reexamine our assumptions. Only then can we hope to transcend the haze of misconception and unlock the truth behind this oft-maligned substance.",
            "In a world that has shed its staidness, the church has undergone a metamorphosis, adapting to the twenty-first century with a newfound flexibility. No longer a bastion of rigidity, it has begun to shed the strictures of its former self, its once-imposing façade now worn and weathered by the whispers of time.\n\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I am reminded of the church as it was in my youth – a place of solemnity and reverence, where the air was thick with the scent of sanctity and the rustle of starched fabric. Every Sunday, I donned my Sunday best – a demure dress, matching shoes, and a purse to match – and joined my friends at the private school I attended on weekends. The ritual was a comforting one, a sense of predictability that anchored me in a world that seemed to be spinning ever more rapidly.\n\nBut as I grew older, I noticed a subtle yet profound change. The church, once a bastion of tradition, began to succumb to the zeitgeist of a more casual era. The teenage mass, a innovation that sought to engage the younger generation, was a telling sign of the times. Services were now neatly condensed into thirty minutes, a fleeting snapshot of devotion in an increasingly harried world. The once-formal attire gave way to a more relaxed, even casual, dress code. Summer Sundays saw beachwear creeping into the pews, a testament to the church's willingness to adapt.\n\nAs I observe this shift, I am struck by the essence of the institution. The church, like the world around it, is a reflection of humanity's evolving values. It is a place where tradition and innovation coexist, where the sacred and the mundane intersect. And yet, despite this adaptability, the church remains a cipher, an enigma that continues to elude my understanding.\n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I am reminded of the complexity of human nature. The notion that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these atrocities is a simplistic one. Pedophilia, I believe, is a product of genetics, a deeply ingrained aspect of an individual's makeup. It is not a choice, a vice that can be eradicated through marriage or any other means. The church, like any institution, is a reflection of humanity at its worst and best. While it is true that some priests have been accused of abuse, it is also true that many have dedicated their lives to selfless service.\n\nThe example of Seventh Heaven, a denomination that allows its ministers to marry, serves as a counterpoint to the Catholic Church's stance. Yet, it also highlights the individual's choice to pursue a particular faith or vocation. If an individual's desires are at odds with the requirements of their faith, perhaps it is time to reevaluate their commitment.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers. The Catholic Church, like the world around it, is a tapestry of contradictions – a place of beauty and ugliness, of light and darkness. Its evolution is a reflection of humanity's own, a slow and halting process that grapples with the complexities of existence.",
            "The ashes of the century still lingered, a cold and festering wound that refused to heal. The echoes of a calamitous day still lingered, a hollowed-out refrain that seemed to seep into every pore. The wounds of September's brutal birth pangs still bled, a festering sore that had yet to scab. The nation's collective psyche remained a maelstrom of anger, a churning sea of discontent that threatened to engulf all in its path. The winds of war had been fanned by the whispers of a pretext, a thin veil of deceit that had been woven to conceal the true intent of those who held the reins.\n\nThe Bush administration, a cabal of men driven by a zealot's fervor, had set the nation ablaze with a war of choice, a conflict born of hubris and a desire for dominance. The lies had been legion, a litany of half-truths and outright fabrications that had been peddled to the public with a zeal that bordered on the fanatical. The notion that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to the nation's security, that he harbored weapons of mass destruction, was a myth, a chimera conjured by the fevered imagination of those who would seek to justify their actions.\n\nAnd yet, even now, the wounds ran deep, a festering sore that refused to heal. The Constitution, that sacred document that had been the cornerstone of the nation's foundation, had been trampled, its principles and ideals cast aside like so much rubbish. The disregard for the rule of law, the flaunting of power, had become a hallmark of the administration, a litany of abuses that had been perpetrated with impunity.\n\nAs the nation teetered on the brink of collapse, the question remained: what had been the true intention of the war? Was it a quest for oil, a desire to secure the nation's energy needs, or was it something more sinister, a bid for dominance in a world that was rapidly changing? The answer, much like the truth, remained shrouded in mystery, a enigma that refused to yield to the probing of reason.\n\nThe situation in Iraq, a quagmire of chaos and confusion, seemed to be spiraling out of control. The interim government, a fragile entity, teetered on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty threatened by the very nations that sought to prop it up. The Parliament, a body supposedly empowered to govern, was a mere shell of its former self, a hollow vessel devoid of purpose or direction. The radicals, a cauldron of dissent and discontent, simmered just below the surface, waiting to boil over and engulf all in their path.\n\nAnd yet, even in the midst of this maelstrom, a glimmer of hope remained. A coalition of nations, a patchwork of interests and ideologies, sought to impose order on the chaos, to bring a modicum of stability to a nation on the brink of collapse. But would it be enough? Or would the very attempts to impose order only serve to exacerbate the problem, to sow the seeds of discord and strife that would ultimately lead to a bitter harvest of blood and tears?\n\nOnly time would tell, but one thing was certain: the wounds of the past would not easily heal, and the future, like the present, remained shrouded in uncertainty, a dark and foreboding mist that threatened to engulf all in its path.",
            "He spoke in hushed tones, his words lost in the haze of indecision.  I'm not sure where to begin, he said, the words like ashes on his tongue.  The War in Iraq, a thing that had consumed the air, the news, the very fabric of life.  He thought of it as a beast, a thing that gnawed at the edges of the world, leaving only ruin in its wake.\n\nIt was a war that had never been declared, a shadowy thing that lurched forward with a hunger for power and for oil.  They had gone in with guns and bombs, with a promise of democracy and freedom.  But it had become a thing of ash and dust, a desolate landscape of burned cities and shattered lives.\n\nHe thought of the families, the sons and daughters who had gone to fight, leaving behind the warmth of home and the comfort of loved ones.  Their faces etched in his mind like the faces of the dead.  The ones who had come back, their eyes haunted, their hearts heavy with the weight of what they had seen.\n\nHe thought of the people of Iraq, their culture shattered, their lives torn apart by the very forces that had come to help.  The Al-Kaida, a hydra-like thing that seemed to grow stronger with each passing day.  Their hatred for the United States a thing that deepened with each passing moment.\n\nHe didn't know what to think, what to feel.  It was a morass of conflicting emotions, a tangle of threads that he couldn't seem to untangle.  He felt a sense of responsibility, a sense of duty to the boys and girls who had gone to fight.  But he also felt a sense of shame, a sense of guilt for the lives that had been lost, the lives that had been torn apart.\n\nThe words tumbled out of him like a confession, a prayer, a plea for understanding.  It was a war that had become a thing of ash and dust, a desolate landscape of burned cities and shattered lives.  He didn't know if it was worth it, if the cost had been worth the gain.  All he knew was that it was a thing that would haunt him, a thing that would stay with him for the rest of his days.\n\nThe words trailed off, lost in the silence.  He was left with only questions, only doubts.  The War in Iraq, a thing that had consumed the air, the news, the very fabric of life.  A thing that would haunt him, a thing that would stay with him forever.",
            "The notion of imposing a law, a declaration of what is permissible or not, strikes a discordant note within me. It is a notion that borders on the hubris of those who would seek to impose their will upon the realm of the sacred, of the churches, where faith and conviction hold sway. The constitution, that enduring testament to the principles of our nation, speaks of the separation of church and state, a clear and unmistakable demarcation between the realms of the temporal and the eternal. To tamper with this balance would be to invite chaos, to upset the delicate equipoise that has been established.\n\nThe churches, not the government, are the proper arbiters of such matters. It is they who have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of the divine, who have walked the hallowed paths of faith for centuries. The government, with its pretensions to omniscience, should not usurp the authority of the churches. To do so would be to elevate the mundane over the sacred, to confuse the roles of the temporal and the eternal.\n\nThe notion of an amendment, of a law imposed by the hand of the state, would be a perversion of the principles that our constitution enshrines. It would be a restriction, not of the government, but of the people, a stifling of their freedom to worship, to believe as they see fit. And for what purpose? To impose the will of one church, one creed, upon the many? It is a notion devoid of merit, a relic of a outdated thinking that would seek to impose a narrow, dogmatic view upon a pluralistic society.\n\nI do not see the rationale behind such an amendment, save for the personal convictions of a few. The president's actions, in pushing for such a law, smack of a disregard for the separation of church and state, a willingness to impose his own views upon the nation, in direct contravention of the principles enshrined in our constitution. It is a step down a perilous path, one that would lead us further down the road of intolerance, of restriction, of the stifling of individual freedom.\n\nIn truth, I see little reason for such an amendment. It would do little to improve our economy, our society, our lives. In fact, it might have a negative impact, stifling the very freedoms that our nation was founded upon. The government should not be involved in this issue, should not seek to impose its will upon the churches. The people, in their diversity, should be free to worship as they see fit, to follow the dictates of their hearts, not the edicts of the state.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should not be involved in this matter. The churches, not the government, should be the arbiters of such issues. The constitution, that sacred document, speaks clearly and unequivocally on this matter. Let us not forget its words, let us not forget the principles that have guided us thus far. Let us preserve the separation of church and state, and allow the people to worship as they see fit, free from the interference of the state.",
            "The war in Iraq, a conflict born of deceit and hubris. It was a war that began as a shroud of secrecy, a tangled web of half-truths and misdirection. The government's justifications, a whispered litany of lies, designed to stir the passions of the American people, to cloak the invasion in a mantle of righteousness. The echoes of September 11th, a distant memory, a false pretext for the blood-soaked sands of Mesopotamia. The drums of war beat out a rhythm of fear and anger, a siren's song that lured the nation into the abyss.\n\nWe were a people, lost and searching, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own self-importance. We were told that the Iraqi government was a monster, a grotesque and malevolent force that threatened our very way of life. But was it not a lie? Were we not being deceived, led astray by the insidious whisperings of our own leaders? The ghosts of Vietnam lingered, a cautionary tale of a war that had been lost, a war that had claimed the lives of countless young men, a war that had left a nation scarred and bitter.\n\nAnd yet, we walked into the void, blind and unprepared, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own arrogance. We removed the government, leaving a power vacuum, a chasm of chaos that would swallow us whole. The aftermath, a nightmarish tapestry of blood and fire, a litany of death and despair. The insurgency, a hydra-headed beast, a creature that would not be slain. We fought the citizens, the very people we claimed to liberate, and we were defeated.\n\nWe were not prepared for the consequences of our actions, nor did we understand the nature of the enemy we faced. We were naive, blinded by our own righteousness, our own self-importance. We were not fighting an army, but a people, a people who refused to be subjugated, a people who would not be silenced. The war in Iraq, a repeat of the mistakes of the past, a war that would haunt us for generations to come.\n\nWe are still there, mired in the quagmire, our casualties mounting, our dreams of a free and democratic Iraq slipping further and further away. The oil, a siren's song, a lure that beckoned us to the abyss. The true reasons for the war, shrouded in secrecy, hidden from the prying eyes of the public. The lies, the half-truths, the misdirection, a cleverly woven tapestry of deceit.\n\nAnd so we are stuck, trapped in a cycle of violence and fear, our hearts heavy with the weight of our own hubris. We are a people, lost and searching, our way forward shrouded in uncertainty. The war in Iraq, a dark and foreboding presence, a shadow that looms over our collective conscience. We can only hope that it will end soon, that the bloodshed will cease, and that peace will return to that troubled land.",
            "The thought stirs like a flame in the dark, a flickering thing that refuses to be extinguished. I am drawn to it, this notion of love without bounds, of two souls entwined in a dance of devotion. It is a notion that has long been a part of me, a whispered promise to myself, a gentle urging to break free from the constraints of a world that seeks to define us by the whims of others.\n\nIn the stillness of night, when the world is hushed and the shadows reign, I am reminded of the fragility of life, the ephemeral nature of our existence. And yet, in this fleeting moment, I find solace in the knowledge that love knows no bounds, that it can transcend the confines of societal expectations, of familial norms, of ancient traditions. It is a love that is raw, unbridled, and unapologetic, a love that refuses to be silenced by the whispers of doubt and fear.\n\nI have always believed that love is a fundamental right, a basic human necessity that should be granted to all, regardless of the labels we assign to it. It is a right that should be protected, cherished, and upheld, not denied or diminished by the arrogance of those who would seek to impose their will upon others. For love is not a choice, it is a calling, a primal urge that cannot be tamed or controlled.\n\nIn this bleak and barren world, where the winds howl and the ash falls like a shroud, I find hope in the resilience of the human spirit. I see it in the way two people, bound by love, can weather the storms, can face the darkness, and can emerge stronger, more steadfast, and more unbreakable. It is a love that is forged in the fire of adversity, tempered by the trials of a world that seeks to tear us apart.\n\nAnd so, I stand steadfast in my conviction, unwavering in my resolve. I believe that love knows no bounds, that it is a fundamental right, a basic human necessity that should be upheld and cherished. I believe that love is a flame that burns bright, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of it. And I believe that it is a love that should be free to flourish, unencumbered by the constraints of societal expectations, unshackled by the chains of oppression.\n\nFor in the end, it is not the laws that govern us, nor the politics that divide us, nor the norms that constrain us, that truly matter. It is the love that we share, the love that we give, and the love that we receive. It is the love that burns within us, a flame that flickers brightly, a light that shines brightly in the darkness.",
            "He'd learned the lesson of the voided spaces where words reside. Where thoughts without borders spread like ash on the wind. When something was placed in the public expanse, it lost all vestige of sanctuary. It became a thing without bounds, a thing that could not be recalled. A thing that would forever bear the weight of perception. As an RA, he'd witnessed it firsthand - the careless utterances, the misplaced words that could spark a fire. The bulletin that arrived at the school, its origin unknown, a harbinger of dread. The friends who'd stumbled upon it, their faces etched with concern. The search for the source, the parsing of intent. The line between jest and gravity, forever blurred.\n\nThe internet, a vast and unforgiving plain, where words were currency and reputation was the cost. No refuge from the gaze of the many, where the private was an illusion. When you entered the public sphere, you surrendered to the whims of others. You couldn't dictate how they'd receive your words, or what they'd make of them. The school officials, bound by duty, had to act on the information they gathered. They couldn't ignore the whispers of a potentially volatile situation. The question, always, was whether the intentions behind the words were genuine or a ruse, a sociology experiment gone awry.\n\nHe thought back to the incident at school, where a student's Facebook page had been scrutinized, its contents deemed a cause for concern. The boundaries between private and public had been breached, and the consequences had been severe. The realization had struck him - the internet was a realm without borders, where the notion of privacy was a myth. If you didn't want your words to be seen, don't put them out there. If you didn't want someone to think a certain way, you couldn't control their thoughts. Schools, he believed, shouldn't befriend their students on social media platforms, shouldn't snoop through their online presence. But if concerns were raised, and the warning signs were heeded, the school had a duty to act. The line between monitoring and invasion of privacy was thin, but when danger loomed, it was a distinction that mattered little.\n\nHe'd learned to be mindful of his words, to consider the reach they might have. To think before posting, before sharing. The world, it seemed, was a fragile tapestry, where a single misstep could unravel the entire fabric. And in this vast and unforgiving expanse, he'd do well to remember the lesson of the voided spaces - that words, once spoken, could not be recalled, and their consequences, forever unbound.",
            "In the wasteland of reason, the war has been reduced to a hollow shell of its former purpose. What was once a crusade to restore democracy in a foreign land has devolved into a protracted exercise in futility. The original intent, to bring light to a land shrouded in tyranny, has been lost in the dust of time. The ghosts of George Bush's past animosities with Saddam Hussein still linger, casting a shadow over the true motivations behind the war.\n\nThe initial spark, a beacon of hope in the darkness, has flickered out, leaving behind a smoldering ember of justification. The war, once a clarion call to freedom, has become a Sisyphean task, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and despair. The first skirmishes, a decisive blow for democracy, have given way to a drawn-out stalemate, a war of attrition that has drained the lifeblood from our economy.\n\nWe were once driven by a noble purpose, a desire to liberate a people from the shackles of oppression. But that purpose has been eroded, worn down by the relentless tides of time. We have lost sight of the initial goal, and now we are mired in a quagmire of our own making. The war has become a self-perpetuating machine, a monster that feeds on our resources, our lives, and our very soul.\n\nThe cost is staggering, a drain on our economy that could be better spent on the pressing needs of our own people. The wars on poverty, education, and healthcare cry out for attention, but our treasure is squandered on a conflict that has long since lost its way. We are bleeding our treasury dry, sacrificing our own citizens on the altar of a cause that has been lost.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to a simple question: what is the true cost of our actions? Is it not time to acknowledge that the war has been a failure, a Pyrrhic victory that has achieved nothing but the perpetuation of a cycle of violence? We must confront the reality of our situation, and acknowledge that it is time to bring this sense of purpose to an end. The war has outlived its usefulness, and it is time to let it go.",
            "A question hung unspoken, like a thing of fragile glass suspended in the air, waiting to shatter. It had to do with the tracings of the past, the echoes of moments lived and lost, and the fragile boundaries of a person's private self. He recalled the words of an old man, a sage from a bygone era, who said that once a thing was placed upon the altar of the internet, it was as though it had been cast to the winds, subject to the whims of an unfeeling world. And so it was with Myspace, a digital realm where the veil of anonymity was but a thin membrane, easily pierced by the prying eyes of others.\n\nHe had heard the tale of a young soul, a wanderer in the digital wilderness, who had stumbled upon a profile, a digital shrine to a person's innermost thoughts and desires. And in that moment, a life was saved, a potential catastrophe averted. Yet, the boy's words hung in the air, a query that spoke to the very heart of the issue: was it right to expect that others would watch over us, to shield us from the dangers that lurked in the shadows of the net?\n\nHe thought of the boy's words, of the fragile balance between freedom and safety, between the desire for anonymity and the need for protection. It was a delicate dance, a precarious tightrope walked by those who ventured into the digital realm. And the consequences of a misstep? Ah, those were as uncertain as the wind that whipped through the dead trees, as ephemeral as the ashes that swirled in the breeze.\n\nIn the end, it was a question that begged for no easy answer, a riddle without a solution. For in the world of the internet, the lines between public and private were blurred, the boundaries between freedom and surveillance ever-shifting. And so, the boy's question hung in the air, a haunting reminder of the fragility of the human heart, and the uncertain future that lay ahead.",
            "The ghosts of war still linger in the ash-scarred landscape. The Iraq War, a calamity of unyielding proportions, continues to haunt us, a specter of hubris and miscalculation. To speak of it now feels like an exercise in futility, a vain attempt to grasp the ungraspable. And yet, I am drawn to the void, compelled to confront the ruin that we have wrought.\n\nLike a man wandering through a desolate landscape, I find myself torn between the weight of conviction and the crushing weight of doubt. I was against the war from the beginning, yet now it seems almost irrelevant, a fact lost in the din of history. The polls, a cacophony of numbers and opinions, scream in unison: seventy-five to eighty percent of the world, eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops, all concurring in their assessment: this war was a grave mistake.\n\nThe administration's recklessness, a product of its own myopia, blinds it to the inherent contradictions of its actions. The Middle East, a cauldron of ancient animosities and cultural fault lines, defies the simplistic notions of democracy and progress. The notion that we can impose our will upon this complex tapestry, that we can somehow \"bring democracy\" to a region where it has never taken root, is a conceit born of arrogance and ignorance.\n\nSaddam, a monstrous figure, may have been a bad man, but his ousting has unleashed a maelstrom of chaos, a quagmire from which we may never extricate ourselves. The administration's talking points, a jumble of half-truths and convenient fictions, fail to convince. The problems of withdrawal, they claim, are too dire, too complex. But I see no legitimate reason to stay. The voices of the Iraqis, the people we claim to be saving, cry out for our departure. Eighty percent, a staggering majority, demand our withdrawal within the year. And what of the quarter who urge us to leave now? Might they not know better than we, the would-be saviors, what is best for their own land?\n\nIf we leave, we can absolve ourselves of responsibility for the disaster that has unfolded. We can say, with a modicum of truth, that we were forced to withdraw by the will of the Iraqi people. But even this weak excuse will not suffice. We will never be the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, not now, not ever. All we can hope for is to mitigate the damage, to leave with a semblance of dignity, rather than the ignominy of continued occupation.\n\nAnd so I ask: what now? How do we extricate ourselves from this festering wound? The answer, like the war itself, remains elusive, a mirage on the horizon of history. But one thing is certain: we must leave, and we must leave soon. The ghosts of war will not rest until we do.",
            "The air was heavy with the weight of unspoken truths, like the faint scent of rain on a dry earth. The fire of equality still smoldered, a flickering flame that danced with the wind of societal norms. I believe that gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, a cancer that seeps into the marrow of our being. It is not a question of men and women alone, but rather the consequence of a culture that has been shaped by the past.\n\nIn the field of work, the glass ceiling still looms, a reminder that even with equality on the books, it is a struggle to shatter the silence of a legacy that reveres the status quo. Women, in particular, face a daunting task in piercing the veil of prejudice, for it is a world that has been crafted to favor the masculine. They strive to reach the pinnacle of success, only to find themselves hemmed in by the fragile glass that separates them from the upper echelons of power.\n\nBut it is not just women who face this trial. Men, too, are bound by the chains of societal expectation. Those who choose to stay at home, to nurture and care for their children, are met with skepticism and scorn, their masculinity called into question. The world looks upon them with a mixture of disdain and confusion, unable to comprehend the notion of a man who puts family above the altar of profit.\n\nIn the fashion industry, the stereotypes are even more pronounced. Men who dare to venture into this realm are often met with suspicion, their seriousness doubted, their passion questioned. They are seen as anomalies, outsiders who do not belong, their masculinity suspect because of their association with a world that is deemed feminine.\n\nBut change is a slow and tortuous process. It is a journey that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to challenge the status quo. We have come a long way, to be sure, but we still have far to go. The fight for equality is not a battle to be won overnight, but a marathon that demands our collective effort.\n\nPerhaps the key to progress lies not in forcing the issue, but in promoting the qualities that define us as individuals. By celebrating the strengths and weaknesses of those who are often stereotyped, we can begin to break down the walls that separate us. We must recognize that intelligence and worth are not solely the domain of the well-spoken, but rather the province of those who dare to be different.\n\nUltimately, the fight for equality is a journey that knows no bounds, a path that winds through the complexities of our collective experience. It is a road that is fraught with obstacles, but one that holds the promise of a brighter tomorrow. As we move forward, let us not forget that change is a gradual process, one that requires our collective effort and our unwavering commitment to the cause.\n\nIn the end, it is not just about men and women, but about the humanity that unites us all. It is about recognizing that we are all equal, that we are all deserving of respect and dignity, regardless of our background or our profession. And it is this understanding that will ultimately guide us toward a future where equality is not just a dream, but a reality.",
            "The understanding of the legal landscape is that they did not completely legalize it, but rather decriminalized it, stripping it of its former status as a felony charge. It is now akin to a traffic infraction, one that garners a citation rather than a full-blown arrest and prolonged court proceedings. Those who are caught are not burdened with the weight of a formal conviction, a concern that had previously hampered many who worried about the long-term implications on their future prospects, such as employment and social standing. Yet, there exists a counterargument that the fiscal burden of policing and prosecuting such offenses is considerable. The cost of apprehending, detaining, and processing individuals, only to release them later, can be a significant drain on municipal resources. Many financially strained municipalities hesitate to adopt such a measure, even if it would free up capital for more pressing needs.\n\nHowever, in places where public opinion leans more liberal, like Denver, decriminalization has become a matter of course. The resulting windfall of revenue has been redirected toward vital community programs, such as education, social services for the elderly, and feeding initiatives for those in need. It is a pragmatic approach that acknowledges the dual nature of this substance – its potential benefits and drawbacks. While its widespread availability might prove a concern, the financial and social implications of its prohibition cannot be ignored.\n\nOne of the lingering reservations about marijuana legalization pertains to its societal acceptance. Some worry that its widespread availability would undermine the cultural taboo surrounding it, leading to public use and, by extension, impaired driving. However, it is worth noting that alcohol, another substance with well-documented impairing effects, has yet to be fully eradicated from our society. Each substance has its unique impact on individuals, influenced by factors such as personality and life choices.\n\nModeration and self-control are key, as people's reactions to substances can vary significantly. It is challenging to generalize about the effects of marijuana, as individuals respond differently. Both alcohol and marijuana have negative consequences, and while some individuals can navigate these substances with ease, others may struggle. This nuanced understanding highlights the complexity of the issue, underscoring the importance of continued dialogue and informed decision-making.",
            "The notion of adhering to tradition is a weight that settles heavy upon the soul. Like the slow accumulation of ash on a weathered stone, the rituals and practices of a bygone era can suffocate the very life that seeks to breathe within them. The Catholic Church, an institution steeped in the rich soil of tradition, stands as a testament to this assertion. Its dogma, a labyrinth of doctrine and teaching, binds the faithful to a strict adherence to the ways of old.\n\nYet, like a river that refuses to be contained, change always seeks to seep into the cracks of the established order. The Church, too, has been shaped by the currents of time, its own waters churning with the disparate voices of its followers. The tension between tradition and adaptability is a chasm that yawns wide, threatening to swallow the very foundations of the institution.\n\nA passage of time, a span of years, a silence of decades – and the world shifts, ever so imperceptibly. The Church, too, must shift, or risk being consumed by the very traditions it seeks to uphold. And yet, like a tree that clings to its ancient roots, it resists the gentle tug of progress. The result is a disconnect, a schism that runs deep, a gulf that separates the teachings of the Church from the lived experience of its followers.\n\nConsider, if you will, the doctrine of love. \"Love thy neighbor as thyself,\" a teaching that echoes through the halls of scripture. And yet, the practice of the Church often seems to falter in its application of this very principle. The prohibition against marrying outside the faith, the rejection of those who do not conform to the established norms – these are but a few examples of the disconnect that exists between the teachings of the Church and the lived reality of its followers.\n\nThe issue of priestly marriage is a case in point. Some argue that allowing priests to wed would help to curb the scourge of pedophilia that has ravaged the Church. But is this not a simplistic solution, one that fails to address the deeper rot that festers within the institution? The abuse of power, the corruption of the sacred – these are not solved by the mere act of marriage. They require a fundamental shift in the way the Church views itself, a recognition that its teachings must be lived, not merely recited.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution that will save us, but the individuals who comprise it. It is not the tradition that will heal the wounds of the past, but the willingness to confront them head-on. As the world outside continues to shift and change, the Church must do the same, lest it be left behind, a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of a time when tradition was more important than the lives of its followers.",
            "A thing that weighs upon my mind, a matter that defies easy resolution. I find myself torn, suspended between the crevices of a dichotomy. The line separating church and state, a divide so fine it's nigh impossible to traverse. And the notion of marriage, a concept as slippery as a snake through the grass. It's a puzzle, a riddle, a thing that shifts and writhes like a living thing.\n\nI'm not one to take a stand, to stake my claim on a particular side of the fence. But I will say this: the boundaries between civil union and sacrament blur and blend like the hues of a sunset. Marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil contract to others. And what of the government's role in all this? Should it concern itself with the sanctity of the union, or merely the legalities? I think it should be the latter. The state's domain is one of law, not dogma.\n\nThe fact that gay marriage is a topic of debate at all speaks to the intractability of the issue. It's a tempest in a teapot, a storm that rages and churns but ultimately resolves into nothing. And yet, it's a tempest that refuses to dissipate, a maelstrom that draws in the unwary. The constitution, a document of grand import, is not a vessel for the whims of the masses. It's a framework, a structure that guides us, not a plaything for the passions of the day.\n\nTo amend the constitution for the sake of banning gay marriage is a notion that strikes me as... misguided. A constitutional amendment is a solemn thing, a weighty matter that should not be taken lightly. It's a decision that should be approached with caution, with trepidation. And yet, in this case, I fear it's a decision that's driven more by emotion than reason.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a home where the words of scripture held sway, where the teachings of the Lord were the guiding force behind every decision. Yet, as I've grown and navigated the complexities of the world, I've found myself drawn to the fringes of that faith, questioning the certainties I once held dear. The matter of homosexuality, in particular, has caused me to wrestle with the fine lines that separate conviction and compassion.\n\nI've had the privilege of forming friendships with individuals who walk a path I don't fully understand, and in doing so, I've come to see the humanity in their struggles. I don't pretend to comprehend the intricacies of their experiences, but I do know that they are not so different from my own. We are all seekers, stumbling through the darkness, searching for a glimmer of light.\n\nAs I've grappled with this issue, I've come to the realization that I don't share the same fervor as some of my contemporaries. I don't see the world in binary terms, where one choice is the only acceptable path. Instead, I believe that the complexities of human emotion and experience demand a more nuanced approach. I think that individuals should have the freedom to live their lives as they see fit, as long as they're not harming others.\n\nThe notion that our leaders should dictate how we live our private lives feels suffocating. The idea that one person's perspective should be imposed upon an entire nation strikes me as a recipe for division and strife. I believe that each state should have the autonomy to determine its own values and laws, rather than relying on a single individual to make decisions for the masses.\n\nIt's a matter of personal responsibility, of living with the consequences of our choices. If I choose to reside in a state that has chosen to legalize gay marriage, then I must respect their decision, even if it differs from my own. I don't believe it's my place to dictate how others live their lives, as long as they're not infringing upon my own rights.\n\nThe notion that a single leader, like President Bush, should have the authority to impose his will on the nation feels anachronistic. He doesn't live in every state; he doesn't bear the weight of every decision that affects the people of this land. His term in office is finite, and when it ends, the decision will ultimately rest with those who come after him.\n\nIn the end, it's up to each individual state to chart its own course, to navigate the complexities of human experience. It's a messy, imperfect process, but it's one that acknowledges the diversity of our nation and the autonomy of its people. I believe that's where true freedom lies – not in the dictates of a single leader, but in the choices we make as individuals, as communities, and as a nation.",
            "The world of the internet, a vast and unfettered expanse where the gaze of the public is unfettered. A bulletin board, a forum for the airing of one's thoughts and intentions, where the pixelated eyes of the world converge to witness the unfolding drama of the self. And yet, the notion of privacy, that fragile and tenuous thing, is lost in the ether like autumn leaves on a gusty day.\n\nThe school officials, those guardians of the academic halls, had every right to peer into the recesses of a student's digital life. For in the public realm, all is fair game. The internet, a labyrinth of interconnected threads, beckons the curious and the prurient alike to explore its depths. And those who venture there do so with the knowledge that their every move is being watched, their every thought laid bare for all to see.\n\nBut what of the school's responsibility to safeguard its charges? Is it not the duty of those who oversee the halls of learning to ensure the well-being of their pupils? To shield them from the dangers that lurk in the shadows of the digital world, where the past and present converge in a maelstrom of consequences. The Columbine incident, a dark and foreboding specter, haunts the dreams of educators, a reminder of the potential for violence that lurks in the hearts of the young.\n\nThe school officials, then, were merely doing their duty, seeking to avert the catastrophe that could have befallen upon them. By monitoring the online lives of their students, they acted to prevent the very thing they feared - the unleashing of chaos and destruction. And in this, they stood as the sentinels of a fragile and besieged institution, ever vigilant in their pursuit of a safer, more secure environment.\n\nBut what of the individual's right to privacy, that cherished and oft-abused notion? Does not the student's expectation of anonymity in the digital realm take precedence over the school's responsibility to safeguard its charges? The answer, much like the digital footprints we leave behind, is a fleeting and ephemeral thing, lost in the vast and uncaring expanse of the internet.\n\nIn the end, it is not the internet that is the problem, but rather our own expectations of it. We venture into this vast and unfettered expanse with the hope of connection, of community, and of expression. But we do so at the risk of being seen, of being watched, and of being judged. And it is in this tension that we find the crux of the matter - the delicate balance between the pursuit of self and the need for safety.",
            "A vast and desolate emptiness had settled within me, a chasm carved by the events of nine eleven. At first, I was a vessel for the fervor that swept the land, my heart afire with a desire for retribution. The wounds of that day still lingered, a festering sore that seemed to cry out for salve. I was convinced that invasion was the answer, that the imposition of our will would bring order to the chaos. But as the months passed, a creeping doubt began to take hold. We had charged into the fray without a clear plan, our hearts heavy with emotion and our minds clouded by anger. We spoke of liberation, but did we truly understand the complexities of the land we sought to shape?\n\nThe people we sought to free were a tapestry woven from many threads, threads that were often at odds with one another. They were a people prone to savagery, their wars a brutal and unyielding thing. And I began to wonder if we were merely pawns in their game, if our presence was little more than a catalyst for their own internecine conflicts. The more I considered it, the more I came to believe that our intervention had been a mistake, a folly born of passion rather than prudence. We had attempted to impose our will upon a people who would not be swayed, who would not be changed. And in the end, it was we who were the ones who were changed, our hearts hardened by the experience.\n\nI often think of my uncle's words, spoken on a long-ago day by the lake's edge. He had taught me that the world was a complex and multifaceted thing, that its workings were not always easy to understand. And I began to see that our actions in that far-off land had been a testament to our own ignorance, our own arrogance. We had charged in with guns blazing, convinced of our own righteousness, but in the end, it was we who were left with the wounds.\n\nI do not know what the future holds, but I do know that our presence in that land has been a futile endeavor. We have made progress, to be sure, but it is progress that will not last. The land will continue to be a battleground, a place of bloodshed and strife. And we will be the ones who are left to pick up the pieces, to wonder why we had thought we could change the course of history. It is a lesson I will carry with me for the rest of my days, a reminder of the futility of our endeavors, and the dangers of acting without thought or foresight."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church stands as a bastion of tradition, its views a testament to the timeless and the unyielding. Yet, in a world where the certainties of the past are slowly receding into the mists of time, it finds itself beset on all sides by the whispers of a changing world. The once-mighty edifice of its influence begins to crumble, its foundations weakened by the weight of its own rigidity. The Church's stance on matters of marriage, life, and death - issues that have come to be seen as relics of a bygone era - only serve to further erode its hold on the faithful.\n\nIt is a truth both plain and unvarnished: the Church's adherence to its ancient dogma has become a barrier, a moat that separates it from the world it seeks to serve. The issue of gay marriage, the contentious topic of abortion, and the question of birth control - all these and more have become focal points of contention, dividing the faithful from those who would follow a more progressive path. The Church's stance on these matters is seen as anachronistic, a relic of a world that no longer exists.\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between right and wrong are increasingly fluid, the Church's absolutism only serves to alienate it from those who would seek to follow its teachings. The faithful are forced to choose between their conscience and their faith, a choice that has become increasingly difficult to make. And so, they turn away, disillusioned by the Church's refusal to adapt to the changing world.\n\nThe question of female priests and married clergy is a curious one. Would the presence of women in the priesthood, or the ability of priests to form families, have altered the course of events? It is impossible to say. Yet, it is clear that the Church's refusal to consider these possibilities has only served to further distance it from the modern world.\n\nThe notion that priests are married to God, and thus devoted to a life of celibacy, is a noble one. But it is a notion that no longer resonates with those who live in a world where the boundaries between the spiritual and the secular are increasingly blurred. The idea that priests, like all men, should be free to form families and love in all its forms, is a notion that seems almost quaint, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIn the end, it is not the Church's views that are the problem, but its inability to change, to adapt to the shifting sands of time. As the world moves forward, leaving the certainties of the past behind, the Church stands frozen in time, a monument to a bygone era. And it is this, more than anything, that threatens to erode its influence, to leave it a relic of a world that no longer exists.",
            "The notion of marriage, that most sacred of human institutions, had long been a subject of contemplation for me. As I pondered the issue of gay marriage, I found myself drawn to a singular truth - that the essence of a person's being, their very identity, is not something chosen but rather an inherent part of their being. Like the rusting hulks of abandoned cars, their sexual inclination is a fact of existence, unshaped by the whims of conscious deliberation.\n\nIn this desolate landscape of human experience, I firmly believed that individuals should not be held accountable for the immutable aspects of their nature. The idea of assigning blame or culpability to those born with a predisposition towards same-sex attraction struck me as a hollow, misguided endeavor. It was akin to condemning a tree for its roots, or a river for its course.\n\nAs I walked the barren roads of this world, I began to see the issue of gay marriage not as a matter of law or morality, but rather as a fundamental question of humanity. Should the federal government, that great arbiter of our collective destiny, intervene in the most intimate aspects of our lives? I thought not. Their reach, much like the withered branches of a dead tree, exceeded their grasp, and they had no business dictating the terms of love and companionship.\n\nIn the end, it was not a question of right or wrong, but of compassion and understanding. The federal government's involvement in the matter seemed a hollow exercise, a futile attempt to impose order on the chaos of human experience. I saw gay people not as aberrations, but as fellow travelers on this journey we call life, deserving of the same dignity and respect as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nAs I sat beneath the darkening sky, surrounded by the skeletal remains of a world that once was, I knew that the issue of gay marriage was not about politics or ideology, but about the human heart. And in that heart, I saw a deep wellspring of love and acceptance, a wellspring that transcended the petty boundaries of man-made law.\n\nIn the silence of the night, I knew that I would stand for the freedom to love, for the right to be oneself, without fear of reprisal or condemnation. For in the end, it was not a question of what we are, but who we are, and the love that we share.",
            "A notion persists, a notion that the union of two individuals, their bond sanctioned by the state, should be limited to those of like kind. Yet, it is a notion bereft of substance, a notion born of fear and misunderstanding. The truth is, the institution of marriage, stripped of its sacred connotations, is little more than a legal arrangement, a social contract between two consenting adults.\n\nIt is a notion that the couple who walk among us, their love and commitment unwavering, are somehow less than those bound by tradition and convention. But what is the basis for this distinction? Is it not the same tender love, the same unyielding devotion that sustains us all? The notion that homosexuals pose a threat to the heterosexual family is a fallacy, a myth perpetuated by those who would seek to impose their will upon others.\n\nThe family is not a static entity, a monolith of tradition and expectation. It is a dynamic, ever-changing entity, shaped by the individuals who comprise it. And yet, we seek to impose upon it a singular definition, a definition that excludes the love and commitment of those who do not fit our narrow mold.\n\nThe civil rights that accompany marriage are not a privilege, but a necessity. They are the rights to property, to healthcare, to the comfort of a loved one's presence in times of need. To deny these rights to a couple, simply because their love is not sanctioned by tradition, is to deny them their very humanity.\n\nBut the issue at hand is not one of morality, for morality is a complex and multifaceted thing. It is a tapestry of differing perspectives, woven from the threads of experience, culture, and personal conviction. To impose one morality upon another, to silence the voices of those who would speak out against oppression, is to act with a zealot's fervor, a zealot's disregard for the diversity of human experience.\n\nThe government, in its role as guardian of the law, should not seek to impose its will upon the people, but rather, it should seek to protect their rights, to ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. The amendment that would ban gay marriage is a misguided attempt to impose a singular morality upon a pluralistic society, a society that values diversity and inclusivity above all else.\n\nIt is a notion that has been perpetuated by those who would seek to control the narrative, to impose their will upon others. But it is a notion that is rooted in fear, in a fear of the unknown, of the unfamiliar. And it is a notion that is at odds with the principles of justice, of equality, and of compassion.\n\nThe American Psychological Association has spoken out against the notion that homosexuality is a result of trauma or personality defect. It is a notion that is based on misinformation, on incomplete understanding. And it is a notion that is rooted in a desire to control, to dictate the terms of human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the government's place to impose its will upon the people. It is not the government's place to dictate what is moral or just. It is the government's place to protect the rights of all individuals, to ensure that all are treated with dignity and respect. And it is the people's place to demand that their government serve the greater good, to serve the principles of justice, equality, and compassion.",
            "The fire of conviction burns within me, a flame that flickers with each consideration of the medicinal properties of a certain substance, one oft-maligned and feared by the masses. In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy where I toil during the summer months, I've come to know the value of such substances. The narcs, the barbiturates, the lysergics - all these and more are staples of our dispensary, held dear for their utility in alleviating suffering and pain. And yet, their illicit status seems to have fostered an aura of taboo, a misconception that these substances are inherently wrong.\n\nBut what of the oxycodone, the Vicodin, the Perocets? Are they not controlled substances, used by our pharmacy with deliberate intent, their benefits weighed against the risks? And is it not folly to deny the medicinal properties of a substance merely because it's been outlawed? The parallels with alcohol are clear - both can be abused, both can exact a terrible toll on the user. Yet, we find no qualm in allowing alcohol to remain legal, its dangers mitigated by education and moderation.\n\nThe key, I believe, lies in gradual integration, in allowing the taboo to erode slowly, that the true nature of the substance may be revealed. For it's not the substance itself that's the problem, but the perceptions that surround it. The image of marijuana as a destructive force, a scourge on society, needs to be shattered. It's a notion born of fear and misinformation, one that's been perpetuated by the very laws that prohibit its use.\n\nIf we could strip away this stigma, this misconception, perhaps people might approach marijuana with a more nuanced view, one that acknowledges its potential benefits, its utility in alleviating suffering. And so, I say, let us reconsider our stance on this matter, and allow the truth to shine forth, unencumbered by the weight of prejudice and fear.",
            "The church had surrendered to the currents of time, its staid traditions worn smooth by the relentless tides of progress. The rigid edifices of old had given way to a more supple, adaptable form. Gone were the days of Sunday finery, of stiff collars and neatly coiffed hair. Now, the faithful donned casual attire, as if the weight of piety had been shed like a worn cloak.\n\nSummer Sundays saw families stumble in, beachwear a stark testament to the languid ease of their morning routine. The morning masses, once a bastion of propriety, now played host to the egalitarian blandness of jeans and khakis. Even the once-revered tradition of dressing up for worship had given way to a more relaxed, almost careless attitude.\n\nBut amidst this shift towards a more casual, more modern expression of faith, a deeper question lingered. Could the encroaching darkness that had besmirched the church's name have been averted if the institution had been willing to bend, to adapt? The specter of pedophilia, a plague that had afflicted the very heart of the church, seemed to mock the idea of change.\n\nSome argued that the issue lay not with the priest's marital status, but with the darkness that lurked within their own hearts. That even marriage, even the sacred bond of matrimony, could not inoculate against the allure of the young and vulnerable. Others posited that the problem lay deeper still, that the very nature of the individual was predetermined, a product of genetics and biology rather than environment or upbringing.\n\nIn the end, it seemed that the church's staid traditions, its adherence to a bygone era, had only served to conceal the rot that had taken hold. The question remained: could anything have been done to prevent the catastrophe, or was it an inevitable consequence of human nature, a darkness that lurked within every soul, waiting to be unleashed?\n\nAs one pondered this question, a sense of despair crept in, a feeling that the very fabric of faith had been irreparably torn asunder. The church, once a beacon of hope, now seemed a shadow of its former self, a testament to the transience of human endeavor.\n\nIn the end, it seemed that the only thing that could have prevented the darkness was a willingness to confront it, to confront the very nature of humanity itself. But even that seemed a distant, perhaps impossible, hope.",
            "The embers of outrage still smolder within me, a flame that refuses to be extinguished by the passage of time. It was a day like any other when the towers fell, their steel and concrete spires crumbling to the ground like shattered icons. The world, it seemed, was forever changed. And yet, in the aftermath, a darkness descended, a shroud that clung to the land like a damp and heavy mist. The drums of war beat out a cadence, a rhythm that struck a discordant note in my heart.\n\nThe Bush administration, a wolf in sheep's clothing, led the charge, their words dripping with deceit like honeyed poison. They spoke of WMDs and bin Laden, their assertions as hollow as the promises of a faithless suitor. The silence that followed was oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocated all dissent. Even Colin Powell, that paragon of integrity, later confessed to his own doubts, a whispered admission that only served to underscore the depths of the administration's malfeasance.\n\nTheir disregard for the Constitution was a blight, a cancer that infected the very fabric of our democracy. They sought to marginalize it, to reduce it to a relic of a bygone era, a relic to be dismissed with a wave of their hand. And all the while, the drums of war continued to beat, a relentless cadence that echoed through the land like a dirge.\n\nBut the truth, like a slow-moving fire, began to spread, a creeping flame that illuminated the darkness. The Secretary of the Treasury, a Cassandra of sorts, spoke out against the administration's designs, his words like a warning cry in the wilderness. The younger Bush, driven by a bloodlust, a vendetta against Saddam Hussein, a man whose name had become a rallying cry for the administration's base. And all the while, the energy interests, like a serpent in the grass, whispered sweet nothings in the president's ear, their influence like a corrupting stain.\n\nThe war, a pyre of burning embers, continued to smolder, casting a shadow over the land. The UN, that bastion of international cooperation, sought to intervene, to bring order to the chaos. But the alternative, a coalition of nations, a patchwork quilt of interests, threatened to unravel the very fabric of Iraq's sovereignty. The Parliament, a fragile reed, bent beneath the weight of competing interests, its effectiveness a distant memory. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, impotent in the face of factional infighting, his authority a fiction.\n\nAnd yet, amidst the chaos, a glimmer of hope flickered, a chance for redemption, a chance to right the wrongs of the past. But like a will-o'-the-wisp, it beckoned, only to vanish into the darkness, leaving behind a trail of ash and regret.\n\nIn the end, it was not the words of the wise that guided us, but the fires of passion, the embers of outrage that still smolder within me, a flame that refuses to be extinguished. For in the darkness, there is always a glimmer of light, a spark that refuses to be snuffed out, a reminder that even in the depths of despair, there is always a way forward, a path that winds its way through the ashes, a path that leads to a brighter dawn.",
            "He spoke, the words gurgling up from the depths of his throat like a stagnant spring, but they lacked conviction, lacking the cadence of truth. They hung in the air, a listless mist that clung to nothing, offered no solace to those who listened. \n\nI did, he said, his voice a monotone drone, devoid of emotion.\n\nThe boy's gaze drifted away, as if searching for a thread to follow, a path to follow through the labyrinth of his thoughts. And then, with a softness that seemed almost painful, he replied, Just talk into it? \n\nThe man's eyes, red-rimmed from the weariness of the world, lifted to meet the boy's, and he nodded, a faint smile creasing his lips. Ok. \n\nThe words spilled out of him, a jumbled mess of thoughts and feelings, like autumn leaves blown by the wind. Ok cool. Uh huh. Uh. The sentences twisted and turned, a contradictory tangle of opinions, each one canceling out the last. \n\nA war in Iraq. Let me see. He searched for the words, but they eluded him, hidden behind a screen of uncertainty. At this point I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually. The words hung in the air, a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down. \n\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S. Like who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven. The past and the present collided, a jarring dissonance that left him reeling. \n\nSo I don't feel like... He trailed off, lost in the depths of his own confusion. I don't know the big details of it. But at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing. And then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them. The words dripped with a cynicism that was almost palpable. \n\nBut it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset. So... And then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day. And then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. \n\nThe words tumbled out of him, a jumbled mess of half-truths and misconceptions. He was adrift, lost in a sea of uncertainty. Um... Let me see... Ohh this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um... War in Iraq... Oh this hard. Uh... Mmm. Uhh... I don't know... Do you have anything else I can go off of? \n\nThe boy's gaze drifted away, lost in thought, as the man's words hung in the air, a fragile, flickering flame that threatened to extinguish itself at any moment. Ok. Thank you. Um... Well um... Actually I think... I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. But because I don't think that... You know... I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that... You know... That we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns. \n\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore. Because like we didn't even call it... It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place. Because it never was declared a war by congress. I think that's how the whole thing works. You have to declare a war by congress. And then it's... I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try...\n\nThe words twisted and turned, a contradictory tangle of opinions, each one canceling out the last. Actually no... I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them. But it's also like wasting our resources. And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like... It's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now... Because of like what it's doing and it's like... And what it's doing to like... Cause remember... I think with the whole Vietnam thing... Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war... And he's like saying... He'll be called like that president forever... That he started this meaningless war and stuff...\n\nThe words hung in the air, a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down. Huh... You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh... Ok yeah... Um... Huh... I guess you could also say that it is... Like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in... Whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like... These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took... I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other... Just because of like the different beliefs that they have...\n\nBut then again... It's like... It's hard to say... I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States... That it's going to be even worse for them... And it's going to be... Like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them... And they've been going on this whole like... Um... Totalitarian... Like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that... You know... I feel like it's gonna... That it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there...\n\nThe words trailed off, a dying ember, flickering in the darkness. Hmm... That's about it. Ok.",
            "The words faltered on his lips like autumn leaves in the wind. He searched for the clarity that eluded him. The notion of legality, a concept forged in the fire of statecraft, seemed to him a hollow thing. It was a notion that sought to impose itself upon the sacred, to bind the unbindable. He thought of the constitution, that hallowed document, and the words that spoke of separation between church and state. A clear declaration, one that had stood the test of time. And yet, he wondered, how could one faith be elevated above others, its tenets enshrined in law, while the rest were left to wither in the shadows? The Catholics, the Christians, they were divided on this issue, their voices raised in discord. And yet, the government, that great Leviathan, sought to impose its will, to dictate what was permissible and what was not.\n\nThe memory of his uncle's words echoed in his mind, a mantra of freedom. \"Separation of church and state,\" he had said, \"is the very bulwark of our liberty.\" And what of the amendment, that proposed restriction on the people? It was a contradiction, a negation of the very principles that had given birth to this nation. A restriction, not on the government, but on the people, a people who had been promised freedom from the tyranny of the state.\n\nHe thought of the president, a man driven by his own convictions, his own faith. But what of the rest? What of the diversity of faiths, the multiplicity of belief? Should one be allowed to impose its will upon the many? He did not think so. The churches, not the government, should be the guardians of faith. And as for the argument that this amendment would boost the economy, he was skeptical. What of the society? Would it not be a society more fragmented, more divided, by such a law?\n\nIn the end, he had said little. His words had faltered, his thoughts unclear. But he knew what he believed. The government should not intervene in matters of faith. The churches, not the state, should be the arbiters of the sacred. And so, he remained silent, his voice lost in the wind, his thoughts a whispered prayer for the freedom to believe.",
            "In the void of our existence, we find ourselves entangled in the threads of a war that wears on like a festering wound. The invasion of Iraq, a calamity born of deceit and half-truths, left an indelible stain on the conscience of our nation. We were sold a bill of goods, a promise of liberation and freedom, but what we reaped was chaos and desolation. The government, driven by a hunger for power and resources, cloaked its true motivations beneath a veil of patriotism and vengeance.\n\nThe link between the 9/11 attacks and the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, yet we were convinced otherwise. The nation's outrage, a wellspring of emotional fervor, was expertly manipulated to justify the preemptive strike. But as we now know, the wounds of war run deeper than the scars of a terrorist attack.\n\nThe parallels between Iraq and Vietnam are striking. Both wars were fought on the battlefield of hubris and misunderstanding, with our government repeating the mistakes of the past, blind to the lessons of history. The toll of American lives lost, a staggering number, serves as a grim reminder of the folly of our actions. We removed a government, only to be unprepared for the aftermath, leaving a power vacuum that spawned chaos and insurgency.\n\nWe were sold a narrative of a swift, decisive victory, but the truth is far more complex. The struggle for democracy is a long and arduous one, a journey that requires patience, wisdom, and a deep understanding of the land and its people. Our government's naivety and shortsightedness led us down a path of destruction, with the Iraqi people paying the ultimate price.\n\nAs I reflect on the decision to invade Iraq, I am reminded of the words of my uncle, who spoke of the impermanence of all things. We were asked to believe that a new government, born in the ashes of the old, would flourish under our guidance. But the truth is that democracy is a fragile thing, easily crushed by the weight of our own hubris.\n\nToday, as we look upon the devastation of Iraq, we see the ghosts of our own making. The war has left us with more questions than answers, more scars than scars can heal. We were deceived, and in our wake, we have left a nation in tatters. The oil, the resources, the politics – all of these played their part in our decision-making, but at what cost?\n\nAs I write these words, I am filled with a sense of unease, a sense of foreboding. The war in Iraq will not be won, not in the way we had hoped. It will not be a victory of freedom, but a Pyrrhic one, born of blood and ashes. And as we look to the future, we must ask ourselves: what will be the cost of our mistakes? Will we learn from our errors, or will we repeat them, ad infinitum?\n\nThe war in Iraq is a testament to our own fallibility, a reminder that we are not infallible, that our decisions have consequences. As we move forward, let us remember the lessons of history, and may our actions be guided by wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the human heart.",
            "In the bleak expanse of a convoluted mind, a thought crystallized like a shard of ice. The notion that love is unbound, that it defies the arbitrary shackles of societal convention. It is a truth both simple and profound, a notion that has gnawed at the edges of my being for as long as I can recall. The acknowledgement of this truth, however, has been a slow and arduous journey, like the crawl of a worm through parched earth.\n\nThe whisper of it began in the earliest days, a tender shoot of doubt that sprouted in the dark recesses of my mind. As I navigated the twisted labyrinth of adolescence, the seed took root, spreading its tendrils deep into my very being. I came to realize that love knows no bounds, that it is a force both fierce and unyielding, impervious to the petty constraints of human law.\n\nThe world, with its pedestrian morality and rigid expectations, cannot comprehend the complexity of the human heart. It is a world that seeks to codify and categorize, to reduce the messy tapestry of human experience to neat and tidy definitions. But love, that most primal and essential of human emotions, cannot be captured within the narrow parameters of societal norms.\n\nAnd yet, I have come to understand that it is not just love that is at stake, but the very essence of humanity itself. The fragile thread of our existence is woven from a tapestry of individual experiences, each one unique and irreplaceable. To deny the validity of love, to reduce it to a mere preference or a sociological construct, is to diminish the very fabric of our humanity.\n\nI have read the words of scholars and pundits, each one attempting to explain the intricacies of the human heart. They speak of biology and sociology, of chemical imbalances and environmental factors. But I know that love is more than just a collection of abstract concepts. It is a lived experience, a pulsing, thrumming reality that courses through every vein and fiber of our being.\n\nAnd so, I find myself drawn to the conviction that love should be a personal, private matter, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation. It is a choice, a decision that belongs to each individual, unshackled from the constraints of a world that would seek to dictate the terms of our existence.\n\nIn the end, I am left with the realization that love is not something to be debated or discussed, but something to be lived. It is a flame that burns bright and true, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems dark and unforgiving. And it is this flame that I would hold aloft, a testament to the indomitable power of the human spirit.",
            "The internet is an unforgiving expanse. A place where one's every thought, every word is laid bare for all to see. It is a public forum, a vast and unyielding tapestry of humanity's innermost musings. Once something is set loose upon its currents, it cannot be recalled. It is a burden that will cling to one like a shroud, coloring the perceptions of others, influencing their judgments. The weight of it is crushing, a constant reminder that one's words have the power to shape the world around them.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this digital landscape. The ease with which a careless utterance can be seized upon, taken out of context, and wielded as a weapon. The delicate balance between humor and menace, between experiment and earnest intent, is easily lost in the void. It is a minefield, a labyrinth of uncertainty, where the unwary can stumble and fall.\n\nIn our own small community, a situation arose that served as a stark reminder of the internet's unforgiving nature. A rumor, a whispered secret, was shared in the electronic ether and soon took on a life of its own. A student's words, meant as a joke, were misinterpreted as a threat, and the consequences were dire. The lesson learned was a painful one: in this public forum, there is no sanctuary, no refuge from the prying eyes of others.\n\nWhen one chooses to share their thoughts, their feelings, their innermost selves with the world, they must be prepared to face the consequences. The internet is a mirror, reflecting back our deepest fears, our darkest impulses. It is a reflection we cannot escape, a constant reminder that our words have the power to harm, to heal, to destroy.\n\nAnd yet, in this digital landscape, there is a fine line between surveillance and intrusion. The school's decision to monitor student activity on social media platforms is a complex issue, one that raises questions of invasion of privacy and the limits of authority. While it may seem intrusive to some, it is a necessary measure, a way to safeguard the well-being of the students in their care.\n\nBut let us not forget that the internet is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides a platform for connection, for community, for the sharing of ideas and experiences. On the other, it can be a breeding ground for anxiety, for fear, for the erosion of trust. The wise approach is to be mindful of one's online presence, to remember that the words we share with the world can have consequences we cannot predict.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, a precarious tightrope we walk between the freedom to express ourselves and the responsibility to consider the impact of our words. The internet is a mirror, a reflection of our collective humanity. Let us approach it with caution, with wisdom, and with a deep understanding of the power that lies within our words.",
            "It seems the war has been an endless and bloody spectacle, a spectacle that has drained the life from us. In the beginning, we were driven by a noble purpose: to bring democracy to a nation ravaged by tyranny. But the months, the years, the endless years have worn down our resolve, and in its place, a different purpose has emerged. One that is no longer about freedom, but about proving our might, about asserting our dominance over a world in ruins.\n\nWe were once a beacon of hope, a shining light in the dark. But now we stumble forward, lost in a labyrinth of our own making. The ghosts of our forebears whisper caution, reminding us of the mistakes of the past. George Bush's father, a man haunted by the demons of his own making, had quarreled with Saddam Hussein, a man as ruthless as the desert sand that consumed him. And so we went to war, driven by a purpose that was both noble and flawed.\n\nWe began with a burst of fury, a declaration of our intent to bring freedom to the oppressed. But the months turned into years, and with each passing day, our purpose grew cloudy, our motives tainted by the weight of our own self-interest. We fought for a war that was already won, a war that had been decided in the first few months. But still we persisted, driven by a will to prove our dominance, to show the world that we would not be defeated.\n\nAnd so we continued to pour blood and treasure into a conflict that had long since lost its justification. We squandered our resources on a war that was no longer about democracy, but about our own pride and ego. We chose to ignore the cries of our own people, who suffered at home while we fought a foreign war. We chose to ignore the weight of our own economy, which groaned under the burden of billions spent on a conflict that had lost its purpose.\n\nThe cost of this war has been incalculable. We have drained our coffers, our people have been killed, and our nation has been torn asunder. And for what? So that we can say we won? So that we can claim a victory that is hollow and empty? No, the time has come to end this war, to recognize that our purpose has been lost, and that we must turn our attention to the problems that plague us at home.\n\nWe have wars to fight, wars that are closer to home: poverty, inequality, and disease. We have children who go hungry, who go without healthcare, and who suffer in the shadows of our great cities. These are the wars that we should be fighting, the wars that we should be winning. But no, we choose to fight a foreign war, a war that has lost its purpose, a war that has become a drain on our economy and our very soul.\n\nLet us end this war, let us bring our troops home, and let us turn our attention to the problems that truly matter. We are a nation that has lost its way, a nation that has forgotten its purpose. It is time to rediscover ourselves, to rediscover our values, and to rediscover our humanity.",
            "In a world where every step is a calculated risk, every digital footprint a potential landmine, one must consider the price of prying eyes. The notion that a life could be saved due to some stranger's curiosity on a site like Myspace is a double-edged sword. It cuts both ways: a blessing and a curse.\n\nThe nature of the internet is a labyrinth, a maze of interconnected threads where anyone can twist and turn to reveal the deepest recesses of a person's soul. The notion that one must accept a stranger as a \"friend\" in order to see their profile is a Faustian bargain. In doing so, one surrenders a piece of themselves, a fragment of their innermost thoughts and desires. It's a vulnerability that can be exploited by those with ill intent.\n\nThe internet, a double-edged sword, can be both a tool for connection and a breeding ground for predators. The ease with which one can uncover a person's deepest fears and desires is a chilling thought. A stranger can uncover a person's screen name, their class schedule, their social circle – the entire tapestry of their life. The notion that anyone can see these things, whether by design or chance, is a heavy burden to bear.\n\nThe school's decision to ban students from having a Myspace may seem like an overreach, a restriction on personal freedom. But in a world where the internet is a minefield, perhaps such measures are necessary. The line between privacy and prying eyes is a thin one, and in the world we live in, it's a line that's constantly being tested.\n\nThe ease with which one can be watched, monitored, and manipulated is a stark reminder of the dangers of the digital age. The notion that some people would seek to exploit this vulnerability for their own gain is a sobering thought. And yet, the allure of connection, of community, is a powerful draw. It's a delicate balance, one that's fraught with peril and uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it's a question of how much one is willing to sacrifice for the sake of connection. Is it worth the risk of being watched, of being vulnerable to those who would do us harm? The answer, like the internet itself, is a labyrinth of contradictions, a maze with no clear exit.",
            "The words falter on the tongue like autumn leaves on a gust of wind. The Iraq War. A calamity born of hubris and folly. I confess, I wince at the thought of speaking out against it now. It's a betrayal of the cynicism that's become so fashionable. But the numbers don't lie. Seventy-five percent, eighty percent - the world, the Iraqis themselves, even the troops on the ground - all in agreement: a grave mistake, a catastrophe foretold.\n\nThe polls reveal a stark truth: we've been wrong from the start. The Middle East, a labyrinth of ancient rivalries and tribal certainties, cannot be remade in our image. The notion that democracy can be imposed, like a foreign skin grafted onto a body that rejects it, is a delusion. The civil war that raged before our arrival has become a mere precursor to the chaos that followed.\n\nSaddam, a monster, to be sure, but a contained one. His removal has unleashed a maelstrom, a desert sandstorm that swallows all in its path. The administration's promises of a brighter future, a beacon of freedom, have proven hollow. The people of Iraq have spoken, and their words are a stark rebuke to our presence: leave now, leave soon, leave forever.\n\nI'm not naive to the perils of withdrawal, the potential for power vacuums and bloodshed. But what's the alternative? To perpetuate a war that's lost its legitimacy, to prop up a puppet government that's a mere shadow of its former self? No, the time for excuses is over. We've heard the whispers of the Iraqis, and it's time to heed their words.\n\nThe notion that we can somehow salvage this debacle, that we can impose our will on a people who've rejected it, is a fantasy. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But perhaps, just perhaps, we can take the first step towards redemption by acknowledging our mistakes, by recognising that our presence has done more harm than good.\n\nThe wind howls through the deserts, a mournful sigh for a war that should never have been waged. The numbers don't lie. It's time to listen to the voices of the Iraqis, to respect their will. Leave now, and let the people of that shattered land begin to rebuild.",
            "The darkness of inequality still lingers in the United States, a specter that refuses to be vanquished. It seeps into every corner of our society, its tendrils snaking through the very fabric of our being. The shadows of gender discrimination persist, a legacy of a bygone era that continues to cast a pall over the opportunities of women and men alike.\n\nIn the world of work, the glass ceiling remains a formidable obstacle, a barrier that prevents women from rising to positions of power. The bias of a society that has long been skewed in favor of men means that even when women possess the qualifications and skills necessary for a particular role, they are often overlooked in favor of their male counterparts. This is not a phenomenon unique to women, however; men too are subject to the whims of societal expectations, forced to conform to traditional roles that stifle their potential.\n\nIn the rarefied world of fashion, men who dare to express themselves through the medium of clothing are often met with skepticism and dismissal. Their interests are seen as frivolous, their tastes suspect. It is a double standard that is both baffling and infuriating, a testament to the enduring power of societal norms.\n\nBut it is not just the workplace or the world of fashion that is affected by these biases. In the private sphere, families are often judged and criticized for their choices regarding childcare and domestic responsibilities. The notion that men are solely responsible for providing for their families, while women are relegated to the role of caregiver, is a tired and outdated one. And yet, it persists, a weight that presses down upon those who dare to defy convention.\n\nTo change this entrenched mindset is a slow and difficult process. Progress is incremental, a crawl forward in the face of entrenched opposition. But progress it is, nonetheless. Women are rising to positions of power, breaking down barriers and shattering glass ceilings. Men are redefining what it means to be a father, embracing their roles as caregivers and breadwinners. And in the world of fashion, the boundaries between men and women are becoming increasingly blurred.\n\nBut change is a fragile thing, easily derailed by those who cling to the status quo. It requires a delicate touch, a subtle navigation of the complex web of societal norms and expectations. It demands that we confront our own biases, that we challenge our assumptions and confront the shadows within ourselves. And it requires patience, a willingness to accept that progress will be slow and incremental.\n\nAs we move forward, it is essential that we recognize the complexities of the issue, that we acknowledge the ways in which societal expectations can create barriers and biases. We must be willing to confront our own prejudices, to challenge the norms and expectations that have been ingrained in us. And we must be patient, knowing that change will take time, that progress will be slow and tortuous.\n\nIn the end, it is not the pace of change that matters, but the direction. For it is in the slow, incremental steps forward that we find the true power of progress. And it is in the willingness to confront our own biases, to challenge the shadows within ourselves, that we find the courage to move forward, to create a brighter, more just future for all.",
            "The notion of legalization. They'd dismantled the edifice of law, reduced it to a whim, a trifling matter, not unlike a traffic infraction. A citation, a paltry fine, and a whispered warning, rather than the stern visage of the law, its icy grip, its unyielding weight. And yet, the specter of consequence lingers, a ghostly presence, a shadow that haunts the waking hours, a specter that refuses to be exorcised.\n\nIn the ledger of the municipal coffers, the cost of prosecution, a formidable column, a weighty burden, a drain on the till. The machinery of justice, a behemoth, a leviathan, that consumes and devours, its appetite insatiable, its belly always growling. And so, the calculus of prudence, a delicate balance, a dance of fiscal responsibility, a waltz of thrift and frugality.\n\nIn Denver, a city of open hearts and minds, a bastion of progress, a beacon of enlightenment, the scales of justice, a seesaw, a balance, a delicate equilibrium, have been adjusted. The municipal treasury, a bulging purse, overflowing with the riches of liberation, the coin of freedom, the currency of possibility.\n\nBut, like a cautionary tale, a whispered warning, a ghostly presence, the specter of excess, a shadowy figure, lurks in the wings, a reminder that even in the land of the free, the chains of habit, the shackles of addiction, the fetters of dependence, still bind and entwine.\n\nAnd so, the dialectic of debate, a seesaw, a balance, a delicate equilibrium, continues, a dance of reason and prudence, a waltz of moderation and restraint. For in the realm of the substance, a duplicitous realm, a Janus-faced creature, a shape-shifter, a chameleon, no two reactions are the same, no two outcomes, no two fates.\n\nThe tapestry of human experience, a complex weave, a rich brocade, a fabric of diverse threads, a kaleidoscope of perspectives, a mosaic of reactions, a symphony of responses. And so, we are left to ponder, to deliberate, to weigh and measure, the pros and cons, the merits and demerits, the pluses and minuses, the advantages and disadvantages, the benefits and the detriments.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of individual discretion, a matter of personal choice, a matter of free will, a matter of moral agency. For, like the whispered warning, the ghostly presence, the shadowy figure, the specter of excess, the chains of habit, the shackles of addiction, still lurk, still wait, still whisper in the darkness, a reminder that even in the land of the free, the choices we make, the paths we choose, the roads we take, are ours to own, ours to bear, ours to suffer.",
            "In response to the question, I would say yes. It is a conviction born of habit, a reflex honed by repetition. We adhere to the traditional ways, the tried and true. The Church's dogma, a labyrinth of rigid doctrine, has shaped our actions for generations. Yet, it is also vital to be malleable, to adapt to the changing tides. The Catholic Church's adherence to long-held practices can be both a blessing and a curse.\n\nLike a well-worn path, their rituals have been trod for centuries. The faithful attend Mass each week, a steadfast devotion to the faith. However, an unyielding rigidity can be stifling, weighing heavily on those who falter or stray. The notion of a perfect Catholic, one who adheres to the doctrine without blemish, can be a crushing burden. And the Church's intolerance of other faiths, of those who do not subscribe to its strictures, is a stain on its reputation.\n\nThe example of my parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, serves as a poignant reminder of this. Their union, deemed unacceptable by the Catholic Church, highlights the very contradiction at the heart of Catholicism. The principles of love and acceptance, core tenets of the faith, are oftentimes at odds with the Church's actions.\n\nAllowing priests to marry, a notion often bandied about, would not necessarily stem the tide of pedophilia. These are individuals who have chosen a path of aberrant behavior, one that transcends the bonds of matrimony. Their predilections are not so easily swayed by the prospect of a spouse.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that holds the key, but rather a fundamental shift in the human heart. The capacity for compassion, for empathy, and for understanding – these are the qualities that must be nurtured, not the strictures of a bygone era.",
            "The line between the state and the church, a chasm so narrow it's often lost in the haze. The question of marriage, a labyrinth with no clear exit. One path leads to the sacred, the other to the mundane. It's a conundrum that defies resolution, a paradox that gnaws at the very fabric of our being.\n\nI find myself adrift, unable to anchor my thoughts in the midst of this tempest. The waters are treacherous, with currents of opinion swirling in every direction. Some claim the government should not intrude upon the sacred, that marriage is a matter of the heart and soul. Others argue that it is the state's duty to define and protect this most fundamental of human bonds.\n\nBut what of the civil union? Is it not the same as marriage, merely a label we apply to two people bound together by love and commitment? Should we not treat them with the same respect, the same dignity, regardless of their station or persuasion? Yet, we must be cautious, lest we tread upon the sacred precincts of the church, lest we offend those who hold dear the traditions of the past.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the matter of gay marriage. A contentious issue, to say the least. Some see it as a mere aberration, a deviation from the natural order of things. Others argue that it is a fundamental right, one that should be protected and celebrated. I am drawn to neither extreme, but rather to a middle ground, a place where love and acceptance reign supreme.\n\nBut should the constitution be amended to ban gay marriage? I think not. Such a change would be a heavy-handed solution, one that would sow discord and division rather than bring people together. The constitution is a sacred document, a blueprint for our nation's ideals and aspirations. It should not be used as a tool for the petty squabbles of the masses.\n\nIn the end, it is not the label that matters, but the love and commitment that lies beneath. Let us not be swayed by the whims of fashion or the dictates of the powerful. Let us instead strive for a world where love is the only guiding principle, a world where two people can come together in the full knowledge that their bond is cherished and respected.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has instilled in me a complex understanding of the issues surrounding homosexuality. As I have formed friendships with individuals from diverse backgrounds, I have come to see the nuance in this matter. While I don't necessarily condone the lifestyle, I firmly believe that it should be legalized, allowing individuals to live freely in accordance with their desires.\n\nThe notion that the president should dictate a national stance on this issue seems misguided. Instead, I propose that each state should have the autonomy to decide for itself. This approach acknowledges the varied perspectives and values of different regions, as some states lean towards democratic ideologies, while others hold more conservative views. If an individual chooses to reside in a state that has legalized gay marriage, it is their responsibility to respect the decision made by the collective.\n\nMy stance is not one of opposition to the idea of equal opportunities for homosexuals. Rather, I believe that the decision to legalize or prohibit gay marriage should be left to the individual states, allowing them to govern themselves accordingly. This approach also acknowledges the impermanence of presidential power, as a new administration may reverse the decisions of its predecessor.\n\nAs the country is comprised of diverse states with distinct values, it is essential to recognize that the president cannot possibly represent the views of every citizen. In this context, it is reasonable to entrust the decision-making power to the states, which will be directly affected by the outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the legalization of gay marriage should be a decision left to the individual states, rather than a national mandate. This approach respects the diversity of the country and acknowledges the complex nature of this issue.",
            "The notion that posting on a public platform such as Myspace is somehow private is a notion that refuses to yield to reason. The very nature of the beast, as it were, is to broadcast one's thoughts and musings to the world at large. It is akin to whispering into the void, save that the void, in this case, is a vast expanse of interconnected humanity, each one of us a node in the grand tapestry of the internet.\n\nAnd so, when a student posts something on Myspace, they must be prepared to confront the possibility that their words will be seen by others, including school officials. The notion that these officials have no right to peruse such postings is a naive one, for they are but a mere drop in the ocean of humanity, connected to the world at large by the very same threads that bind us all.\n\nBut, as with all things, there is a balance to be struck. On one hand, the school officials have a duty to maintain a safe and secure environment for their students. And if that means monitoring the online activities of those students, so be it. It is a small price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with knowing that one's child is safe from the ravages of the world.\n\nAnd yet, there is a fine line to be walked here. For if the officials are merely using the internet as a means to catch students in the act of wrongdoing, then that is an invasion of privacy, pure and simple. But if their actions are motivated by a desire to create a safer environment, then perhaps they are doing what is necessary.\n\nThe example of school drills, such as those conducted in response to the threat of terrorist attacks, is instructive here. In those cases, the school officials are taking proactive measures to prepare for the worst-case scenario, and in doing so, they are creating a safer environment for all. It is the same with monitoring online activity - if it is done with the intention of preventing harm, then it is a necessary evil.\n\nBut, as with all things, there is a darker side to this coin. For once something is posted online, it is there forever, waiting to be discovered by those who would do us harm. And it is a sobering thought, indeed, to consider that even as an adult, one's past mistakes can come back to haunt them, like a specter from the grave.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance that must be struck. On one hand, we have the right to free expression, but on the other, we have the duty to protect ourselves and others from harm. It is a balance that is not always easy to maintain, but it is one that we must strive for, lest we succumb to the very real dangers that lurk in the shadows of the internet.",
            "The weight of memory hung in the air like the ashes that clung to every surface. It was as if the very fabric of the world had been torn asunder, leaving only the bleak and barren expanse of regret. The sting of nine eleven still lingered, a festering wound that would not heal. I had been drawn to the conflict like a moth to flame, driven by a mix of emotions and misplaced idealism. The fervor of the moment had consumed me, and I had been blind to the consequences.\n\nBut time had passed, and with it, a measure of clarity. I saw now that we had gone to war with a lack of foresight and planning, driven by rage and a desire for revenge. We had been unprepared for the complexities of the conflict, and the people of that land were not the enemies we had made them out to be. They were a people consumed by their own internal struggles, their own savagery, and we had only added to their woe.\n\nI thought of the President's words, the declarations of war, the promises of a better future. But it was all a facade, a thin veil hiding the truth. We had gone to war with a messianic zeal, convinced that we could remake the world in our image. But we were not gods, and our efforts had only served to further destabilize the region.\n\nI thought of the people, their faces twisted in anger and hatred, their bodies worn down by the endless struggle. They were not our enemies, they were our mirror, reflecting back the darkness that lurked within ourselves. And we had only added to their pain, our presence a constant reminder of the chaos we had unleashed.\n\nI did not know what the future held, but I knew that we could not stay. The war had been a blight, a cancer that had consumed everything in its path. We had to leave, to let the people of that land pick up the pieces and rebuild. It was a bitter truth, but one that I had come to accept. We had been wrong to go to war, and we had to be wrong to stay.\n\nThe weight of memory still lingered, but I had come to see it for what it was – a reminder of our folly, a warning to future generations. We had been blinded by our emotions, our desire for revenge, and our arrogance. But we had to learn from our mistakes, to acknowledge the harm we had caused, and to leave the people of that land to their own Devices.\n\nI did not know what the future held, but I knew that we had to let go. We had to release the burden of our guilt, our anger, and our regret. We had to leave the war behind, to forge a new path, one that was guided by wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the complexities of the world. It was a difficult truth, but one that I had come to accept – we had to leave, and we had to let go."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church stands as a bastion of tradition, its views a testament to the timeless and the unyielding. Yet, in a world where the certainties of the past are slowly receding into the mists of time, it finds itself beset on all sides by the whispers of a changing world. The once-mighty edifice of its influence begins to crumble, its foundations weakened by the weight of its own rigidity. The Church's stance on matters of marriage, life, and death - issues that have come to be seen as relics of a bygone era - only serve to further erode its hold on the faithful.\n\nIt is a truth both plain and unvarnished: the Church's adherence to its ancient dogma has become a barrier, a moat that separates it from the world it seeks to serve. The issue of gay marriage, the contentious topic of abortion, and the question of birth control - all these and more have become focal points of contention, dividing the faithful from those who would follow a more progressive path. The Church's stance on these matters is seen as anachronistic, a relic of a world that no longer exists.\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between right and wrong are increasingly fluid, the Church's absolutism only serves to alienate it from those who would seek to follow its teachings. The faithful are forced to choose between their conscience and their faith, a choice that has become increasingly difficult to make. And so, they turn away, disillusioned by the Church's refusal to adapt to the changing world.\n\nThe question of female priests and married clergy is a curious one. Would the presence of women in the priesthood, or the ability of priests to form families, have altered the course of events? It is impossible to say. Yet, it is clear that the Church's refusal to consider these possibilities has only served to further distance it from the modern world.\n\nThe notion that priests are married to God, and thus devoted to a life of celibacy, is a noble one. But it is a notion that no longer resonates with those who live in a world where the boundaries between the spiritual and the secular are increasingly blurred. The idea that priests, like all men, should be free to form families and love in all its forms, is a notion that seems almost quaint, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIn the end, it is not the Church's views that are the problem, but its inability to change, to adapt to the shifting sands of time. As the world moves forward, leaving the certainties of the past behind, the Church stands frozen in time, a monument to a bygone era. And it is this, more than anything, that threatens to erode its influence, to leave it a relic of a world that no longer exists.",
            "The notion of marriage, that most sacred of human institutions, had long been a subject of contemplation for me. As I pondered the issue of gay marriage, I found myself drawn to a singular truth - that the essence of a person's being, their very identity, is not something chosen but rather an inherent part of their being. Like the rusting hulks of abandoned cars, their sexual inclination is a fact of existence, unshaped by the whims of conscious deliberation.\n\nIn this desolate landscape of human experience, I firmly believed that individuals should not be held accountable for the immutable aspects of their nature. The idea of assigning blame or culpability to those born with a predisposition towards same-sex attraction struck me as a hollow, misguided endeavor. It was akin to condemning a tree for its roots, or a river for its course.\n\nAs I walked the barren roads of this world, I began to see the issue of gay marriage not as a matter of law or morality, but rather as a fundamental question of humanity. Should the federal government, that great arbiter of our collective destiny, intervene in the most intimate aspects of our lives? I thought not. Their reach, much like the withered branches of a dead tree, exceeded their grasp, and they had no business dictating the terms of love and companionship.\n\nIn the end, it was not a question of right or wrong, but of compassion and understanding. The federal government's involvement in the matter seemed a hollow exercise, a futile attempt to impose order on the chaos of human experience. I saw gay people not as aberrations, but as fellow travelers on this journey we call life, deserving of the same dignity and respect as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nAs I sat beneath the darkening sky, surrounded by the skeletal remains of a world that once was, I knew that the issue of gay marriage was not about politics or ideology, but about the human heart. And in that heart, I saw a deep wellspring of love and acceptance, a wellspring that transcended the petty boundaries of man-made law.\n\nIn the silence of the night, I knew that I would stand for the freedom to love, for the right to be oneself, without fear of reprisal or condemnation. For in the end, it was not a question of what we are, but who we are, and the love that we share.",
            "A notion persists, a notion that the union of two individuals, their bond sanctioned by the state, should be limited to those of like kind. Yet, it is a notion bereft of substance, a notion born of fear and misunderstanding. The truth is, the institution of marriage, stripped of its sacred connotations, is little more than a legal arrangement, a social contract between two consenting adults.\n\nIt is a notion that the couple who walk among us, their love and commitment unwavering, are somehow less than those bound by tradition and convention. But what is the basis for this distinction? Is it not the same tender love, the same unyielding devotion that sustains us all? The notion that homosexuals pose a threat to the heterosexual family is a fallacy, a myth perpetuated by those who would seek to impose their will upon others.\n\nThe family is not a static entity, a monolith of tradition and expectation. It is a dynamic, ever-changing entity, shaped by the individuals who comprise it. And yet, we seek to impose upon it a singular definition, a definition that excludes the love and commitment of those who do not fit our narrow mold.\n\nThe civil rights that accompany marriage are not a privilege, but a necessity. They are the rights to property, to healthcare, to the comfort of a loved one's presence in times of need. To deny these rights to a couple, simply because their love is not sanctioned by tradition, is to deny them their very humanity.\n\nBut the issue at hand is not one of morality, for morality is a complex and multifaceted thing. It is a tapestry of differing perspectives, woven from the threads of experience, culture, and personal conviction. To impose one morality upon another, to silence the voices of those who would speak out against oppression, is to act with a zealot's fervor, a zealot's disregard for the diversity of human experience.\n\nThe government, in its role as guardian of the law, should not seek to impose its will upon the people, but rather, it should seek to protect their rights, to ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. The amendment that would ban gay marriage is a misguided attempt to impose a singular morality upon a pluralistic society, a society that values diversity and inclusivity above all else.\n\nIt is a notion that has been perpetuated by those who would seek to control the narrative, to impose their will upon others. But it is a notion that is rooted in fear, in a fear of the unknown, of the unfamiliar. And it is a notion that is at odds with the principles of justice, of equality, and of compassion.\n\nThe American Psychological Association has spoken out against the notion that homosexuality is a result of trauma or personality defect. It is a notion that is based on misinformation, on incomplete understanding. And it is a notion that is rooted in a desire to control, to dictate the terms of human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the government's place to impose its will upon the people. It is not the government's place to dictate what is moral or just. It is the government's place to protect the rights of all individuals, to ensure that all are treated with dignity and respect. And it is the people's place to demand that their government serve the greater good, to serve the principles of justice, equality, and compassion.",
            "The fire of conviction burns within me, a flame that flickers with each consideration of the medicinal properties of a certain substance, one oft-maligned and feared by the masses. In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy where I toil during the summer months, I've come to know the value of such substances. The narcs, the barbiturates, the lysergics - all these and more are staples of our dispensary, held dear for their utility in alleviating suffering and pain. And yet, their illicit status seems to have fostered an aura of taboo, a misconception that these substances are inherently wrong.\n\nBut what of the oxycodone, the Vicodin, the Perocets? Are they not controlled substances, used by our pharmacy with deliberate intent, their benefits weighed against the risks? And is it not folly to deny the medicinal properties of a substance merely because it's been outlawed? The parallels with alcohol are clear - both can be abused, both can exact a terrible toll on the user. Yet, we find no qualm in allowing alcohol to remain legal, its dangers mitigated by education and moderation.\n\nThe key, I believe, lies in gradual integration, in allowing the taboo to erode slowly, that the true nature of the substance may be revealed. For it's not the substance itself that's the problem, but the perceptions that surround it. The image of marijuana as a destructive force, a scourge on society, needs to be shattered. It's a notion born of fear and misinformation, one that's been perpetuated by the very laws that prohibit its use.\n\nIf we could strip away this stigma, this misconception, perhaps people might approach marijuana with a more nuanced view, one that acknowledges its potential benefits, its utility in alleviating suffering. And so, I say, let us reconsider our stance on this matter, and allow the truth to shine forth, unencumbered by the weight of prejudice and fear.",
            "The church had surrendered to the currents of time, its staid traditions worn smooth by the relentless tides of progress. The rigid edifices of old had given way to a more supple, adaptable form. Gone were the days of Sunday finery, of stiff collars and neatly coiffed hair. Now, the faithful donned casual attire, as if the weight of piety had been shed like a worn cloak.\n\nSummer Sundays saw families stumble in, beachwear a stark testament to the languid ease of their morning routine. The morning masses, once a bastion of propriety, now played host to the egalitarian blandness of jeans and khakis. Even the once-revered tradition of dressing up for worship had given way to a more relaxed, almost careless attitude.\n\nBut amidst this shift towards a more casual, more modern expression of faith, a deeper question lingered. Could the encroaching darkness that had besmirched the church's name have been averted if the institution had been willing to bend, to adapt? The specter of pedophilia, a plague that had afflicted the very heart of the church, seemed to mock the idea of change.\n\nSome argued that the issue lay not with the priest's marital status, but with the darkness that lurked within their own hearts. That even marriage, even the sacred bond of matrimony, could not inoculate against the allure of the young and vulnerable. Others posited that the problem lay deeper still, that the very nature of the individual was predetermined, a product of genetics and biology rather than environment or upbringing.\n\nIn the end, it seemed that the church's staid traditions, its adherence to a bygone era, had only served to conceal the rot that had taken hold. The question remained: could anything have been done to prevent the catastrophe, or was it an inevitable consequence of human nature, a darkness that lurked within every soul, waiting to be unleashed?\n\nAs one pondered this question, a sense of despair crept in, a feeling that the very fabric of faith had been irreparably torn asunder. The church, once a beacon of hope, now seemed a shadow of its former self, a testament to the transience of human endeavor.\n\nIn the end, it seemed that the only thing that could have prevented the darkness was a willingness to confront it, to confront the very nature of humanity itself. But even that seemed a distant, perhaps impossible, hope.",
            "The embers of outrage still smolder within me, a flame that refuses to be extinguished by the passage of time. It was a day like any other when the towers fell, their steel and concrete spires crumbling to the ground like shattered icons. The world, it seemed, was forever changed. And yet, in the aftermath, a darkness descended, a shroud that clung to the land like a damp and heavy mist. The drums of war beat out a cadence, a rhythm that struck a discordant note in my heart.\n\nThe Bush administration, a wolf in sheep's clothing, led the charge, their words dripping with deceit like honeyed poison. They spoke of WMDs and bin Laden, their assertions as hollow as the promises of a faithless suitor. The silence that followed was oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocated all dissent. Even Colin Powell, that paragon of integrity, later confessed to his own doubts, a whispered admission that only served to underscore the depths of the administration's malfeasance.\n\nTheir disregard for the Constitution was a blight, a cancer that infected the very fabric of our democracy. They sought to marginalize it, to reduce it to a relic of a bygone era, a relic to be dismissed with a wave of their hand. And all the while, the drums of war continued to beat, a relentless cadence that echoed through the land like a dirge.\n\nBut the truth, like a slow-moving fire, began to spread, a creeping flame that illuminated the darkness. The Secretary of the Treasury, a Cassandra of sorts, spoke out against the administration's designs, his words like a warning cry in the wilderness. The younger Bush, driven by a bloodlust, a vendetta against Saddam Hussein, a man whose name had become a rallying cry for the administration's base. And all the while, the energy interests, like a serpent in the grass, whispered sweet nothings in the president's ear, their influence like a corrupting stain.\n\nThe war, a pyre of burning embers, continued to smolder, casting a shadow over the land. The UN, that bastion of international cooperation, sought to intervene, to bring order to the chaos. But the alternative, a coalition of nations, a patchwork quilt of interests, threatened to unravel the very fabric of Iraq's sovereignty. The Parliament, a fragile reed, bent beneath the weight of competing interests, its effectiveness a distant memory. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, impotent in the face of factional infighting, his authority a fiction.\n\nAnd yet, amidst the chaos, a glimmer of hope flickered, a chance for redemption, a chance to right the wrongs of the past. But like a will-o'-the-wisp, it beckoned, only to vanish into the darkness, leaving behind a trail of ash and regret.\n\nIn the end, it was not the words of the wise that guided us, but the fires of passion, the embers of outrage that still smolder within me, a flame that refuses to be extinguished. For in the darkness, there is always a glimmer of light, a spark that refuses to be snuffed out, a reminder that even in the depths of despair, there is always a way forward, a path that winds its way through the ashes, a path that leads to a brighter dawn.",
            "He spoke, the words gurgling up from the depths of his throat like a stagnant spring, but they lacked conviction, lacking the cadence of truth. They hung in the air, a listless mist that clung to nothing, offered no solace to those who listened. \n\nI did, he said, his voice a monotone drone, devoid of emotion.\n\nThe boy's gaze drifted away, as if searching for a thread to follow, a path to follow through the labyrinth of his thoughts. And then, with a softness that seemed almost painful, he replied, Just talk into it? \n\nThe man's eyes, red-rimmed from the weariness of the world, lifted to meet the boy's, and he nodded, a faint smile creasing his lips. Ok. \n\nThe words spilled out of him, a jumbled mess of thoughts and feelings, like autumn leaves blown by the wind. Ok cool. Uh huh. Uh. The sentences twisted and turned, a contradictory tangle of opinions, each one canceling out the last. \n\nA war in Iraq. Let me see. He searched for the words, but they eluded him, hidden behind a screen of uncertainty. At this point I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually. The words hung in the air, a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down. \n\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S. Like who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven. The past and the present collided, a jarring dissonance that left him reeling. \n\nSo I don't feel like... He trailed off, lost in the depths of his own confusion. I don't know the big details of it. But at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing. And then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them. The words dripped with a cynicism that was almost palpable. \n\nBut it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset. So... And then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day. And then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. \n\nThe words tumbled out of him, a jumbled mess of half-truths and misconceptions. He was adrift, lost in a sea of uncertainty. Um... Let me see... Ohh this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um... War in Iraq... Oh this hard. Uh... Mmm. Uhh... I don't know... Do you have anything else I can go off of? \n\nThe boy's gaze drifted away, lost in thought, as the man's words hung in the air, a fragile, flickering flame that threatened to extinguish itself at any moment. Ok. Thank you. Um... Well um... Actually I think... I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. But because I don't think that... You know... I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that... You know... That we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns. \n\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore. Because like we didn't even call it... It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place. Because it never was declared a war by congress. I think that's how the whole thing works. You have to declare a war by congress. And then it's... I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try...\n\nThe words twisted and turned, a contradictory tangle of opinions, each one canceling out the last. Actually no... I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them. But it's also like wasting our resources. And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like... It's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now... Because of like what it's doing and it's like... And what it's doing to like... Cause remember... I think with the whole Vietnam thing... Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war... And he's like saying... He'll be called like that president forever... That he started this meaningless war and stuff...\n\nThe words hung in the air, a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down. Huh... You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh... Ok yeah... Um... Huh... I guess you could also say that it is... Like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in... Whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like... These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took... I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other... Just because of like the different beliefs that they have...\n\nBut then again... It's like... It's hard to say... I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States... That it's going to be even worse for them... And it's going to be... Like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them... And they've been going on this whole like... Um... Totalitarian... Like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that... You know... I feel like it's gonna... That it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there...\n\nThe words trailed off, a dying ember, flickering in the darkness. Hmm... That's about it. Ok.",
            "The words faltered on his lips like autumn leaves in the wind. He searched for the clarity that eluded him. The notion of legality, a concept forged in the fire of statecraft, seemed to him a hollow thing. It was a notion that sought to impose itself upon the sacred, to bind the unbindable. He thought of the constitution, that hallowed document, and the words that spoke of separation between church and state. A clear declaration, one that had stood the test of time. And yet, he wondered, how could one faith be elevated above others, its tenets enshrined in law, while the rest were left to wither in the shadows? The Catholics, the Christians, they were divided on this issue, their voices raised in discord. And yet, the government, that great Leviathan, sought to impose its will, to dictate what was permissible and what was not.\n\nThe memory of his uncle's words echoed in his mind, a mantra of freedom. \"Separation of church and state,\" he had said, \"is the very bulwark of our liberty.\" And what of the amendment, that proposed restriction on the people? It was a contradiction, a negation of the very principles that had given birth to this nation. A restriction, not on the government, but on the people, a people who had been promised freedom from the tyranny of the state.\n\nHe thought of the president, a man driven by his own convictions, his own faith. But what of the rest? What of the diversity of faiths, the multiplicity of belief? Should one be allowed to impose its will upon the many? He did not think so. The churches, not the government, should be the guardians of faith. And as for the argument that this amendment would boost the economy, he was skeptical. What of the society? Would it not be a society more fragmented, more divided, by such a law?\n\nIn the end, he had said little. His words had faltered, his thoughts unclear. But he knew what he believed. The government should not intervene in matters of faith. The churches, not the state, should be the arbiters of the sacred. And so, he remained silent, his voice lost in the wind, his thoughts a whispered prayer for the freedom to believe.",
            "In the void of our existence, we find ourselves entangled in the threads of a war that wears on like a festering wound. The invasion of Iraq, a calamity born of deceit and half-truths, left an indelible stain on the conscience of our nation. We were sold a bill of goods, a promise of liberation and freedom, but what we reaped was chaos and desolation. The government, driven by a hunger for power and resources, cloaked its true motivations beneath a veil of patriotism and vengeance.\n\nThe link between the 9/11 attacks and the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, yet we were convinced otherwise. The nation's outrage, a wellspring of emotional fervor, was expertly manipulated to justify the preemptive strike. But as we now know, the wounds of war run deeper than the scars of a terrorist attack.\n\nThe parallels between Iraq and Vietnam are striking. Both wars were fought on the battlefield of hubris and misunderstanding, with our government repeating the mistakes of the past, blind to the lessons of history. The toll of American lives lost, a staggering number, serves as a grim reminder of the folly of our actions. We removed a government, only to be unprepared for the aftermath, leaving a power vacuum that spawned chaos and insurgency.\n\nWe were sold a narrative of a swift, decisive victory, but the truth is far more complex. The struggle for democracy is a long and arduous one, a journey that requires patience, wisdom, and a deep understanding of the land and its people. Our government's naivety and shortsightedness led us down a path of destruction, with the Iraqi people paying the ultimate price.\n\nAs I reflect on the decision to invade Iraq, I am reminded of the words of my uncle, who spoke of the impermanence of all things. We were asked to believe that a new government, born in the ashes of the old, would flourish under our guidance. But the truth is that democracy is a fragile thing, easily crushed by the weight of our own hubris.\n\nToday, as we look upon the devastation of Iraq, we see the ghosts of our own making. The war has left us with more questions than answers, more scars than scars can heal. We were deceived, and in our wake, we have left a nation in tatters. The oil, the resources, the politics – all of these played their part in our decision-making, but at what cost?\n\nAs I write these words, I am filled with a sense of unease, a sense of foreboding. The war in Iraq will not be won, not in the way we had hoped. It will not be a victory of freedom, but a Pyrrhic one, born of blood and ashes. And as we look to the future, we must ask ourselves: what will be the cost of our mistakes? Will we learn from our errors, or will we repeat them, ad infinitum?\n\nThe war in Iraq is a testament to our own fallibility, a reminder that we are not infallible, that our decisions have consequences. As we move forward, let us remember the lessons of history, and may our actions be guided by wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the human heart.",
            "In the bleak expanse of a convoluted mind, a thought crystallized like a shard of ice. The notion that love is unbound, that it defies the arbitrary shackles of societal convention. It is a truth both simple and profound, a notion that has gnawed at the edges of my being for as long as I can recall. The acknowledgement of this truth, however, has been a slow and arduous journey, like the crawl of a worm through parched earth.\n\nThe whisper of it began in the earliest days, a tender shoot of doubt that sprouted in the dark recesses of my mind. As I navigated the twisted labyrinth of adolescence, the seed took root, spreading its tendrils deep into my very being. I came to realize that love knows no bounds, that it is a force both fierce and unyielding, impervious to the petty constraints of human law.\n\nThe world, with its pedestrian morality and rigid expectations, cannot comprehend the complexity of the human heart. It is a world that seeks to codify and categorize, to reduce the messy tapestry of human experience to neat and tidy definitions. But love, that most primal and essential of human emotions, cannot be captured within the narrow parameters of societal norms.\n\nAnd yet, I have come to understand that it is not just love that is at stake, but the very essence of humanity itself. The fragile thread of our existence is woven from a tapestry of individual experiences, each one unique and irreplaceable. To deny the validity of love, to reduce it to a mere preference or a sociological construct, is to diminish the very fabric of our humanity.\n\nI have read the words of scholars and pundits, each one attempting to explain the intricacies of the human heart. They speak of biology and sociology, of chemical imbalances and environmental factors. But I know that love is more than just a collection of abstract concepts. It is a lived experience, a pulsing, thrumming reality that courses through every vein and fiber of our being.\n\nAnd so, I find myself drawn to the conviction that love should be a personal, private matter, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation. It is a choice, a decision that belongs to each individual, unshackled from the constraints of a world that would seek to dictate the terms of our existence.\n\nIn the end, I am left with the realization that love is not something to be debated or discussed, but something to be lived. It is a flame that burns bright and true, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems dark and unforgiving. And it is this flame that I would hold aloft, a testament to the indomitable power of the human spirit.",
            "The internet is an unforgiving expanse. A place where one's every thought, every word is laid bare for all to see. It is a public forum, a vast and unyielding tapestry of humanity's innermost musings. Once something is set loose upon its currents, it cannot be recalled. It is a burden that will cling to one like a shroud, coloring the perceptions of others, influencing their judgments. The weight of it is crushing, a constant reminder that one's words have the power to shape the world around them.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this digital landscape. The ease with which a careless utterance can be seized upon, taken out of context, and wielded as a weapon. The delicate balance between humor and menace, between experiment and earnest intent, is easily lost in the void. It is a minefield, a labyrinth of uncertainty, where the unwary can stumble and fall.\n\nIn our own small community, a situation arose that served as a stark reminder of the internet's unforgiving nature. A rumor, a whispered secret, was shared in the electronic ether and soon took on a life of its own. A student's words, meant as a joke, were misinterpreted as a threat, and the consequences were dire. The lesson learned was a painful one: in this public forum, there is no sanctuary, no refuge from the prying eyes of others.\n\nWhen one chooses to share their thoughts, their feelings, their innermost selves with the world, they must be prepared to face the consequences. The internet is a mirror, reflecting back our deepest fears, our darkest impulses. It is a reflection we cannot escape, a constant reminder that our words have the power to harm, to heal, to destroy.\n\nAnd yet, in this digital landscape, there is a fine line between surveillance and intrusion. The school's decision to monitor student activity on social media platforms is a complex issue, one that raises questions of invasion of privacy and the limits of authority. While it may seem intrusive to some, it is a necessary measure, a way to safeguard the well-being of the students in their care.\n\nBut let us not forget that the internet is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides a platform for connection, for community, for the sharing of ideas and experiences. On the other, it can be a breeding ground for anxiety, for fear, for the erosion of trust. The wise approach is to be mindful of one's online presence, to remember that the words we share with the world can have consequences we cannot predict.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, a precarious tightrope we walk between the freedom to express ourselves and the responsibility to consider the impact of our words. The internet is a mirror, a reflection of our collective humanity. Let us approach it with caution, with wisdom, and with a deep understanding of the power that lies within our words.",
            "It seems the war has been an endless and bloody spectacle, a spectacle that has drained the life from us. In the beginning, we were driven by a noble purpose: to bring democracy to a nation ravaged by tyranny. But the months, the years, the endless years have worn down our resolve, and in its place, a different purpose has emerged. One that is no longer about freedom, but about proving our might, about asserting our dominance over a world in ruins.\n\nWe were once a beacon of hope, a shining light in the dark. But now we stumble forward, lost in a labyrinth of our own making. The ghosts of our forebears whisper caution, reminding us of the mistakes of the past. George Bush's father, a man haunted by the demons of his own making, had quarreled with Saddam Hussein, a man as ruthless as the desert sand that consumed him. And so we went to war, driven by a purpose that was both noble and flawed.\n\nWe began with a burst of fury, a declaration of our intent to bring freedom to the oppressed. But the months turned into years, and with each passing day, our purpose grew cloudy, our motives tainted by the weight of our own self-interest. We fought for a war that was already won, a war that had been decided in the first few months. But still we persisted, driven by a will to prove our dominance, to show the world that we would not be defeated.\n\nAnd so we continued to pour blood and treasure into a conflict that had long since lost its justification. We squandered our resources on a war that was no longer about democracy, but about our own pride and ego. We chose to ignore the cries of our own people, who suffered at home while we fought a foreign war. We chose to ignore the weight of our own economy, which groaned under the burden of billions spent on a conflict that had lost its purpose.\n\nThe cost of this war has been incalculable. We have drained our coffers, our people have been killed, and our nation has been torn asunder. And for what? So that we can say we won? So that we can claim a victory that is hollow and empty? No, the time has come to end this war, to recognize that our purpose has been lost, and that we must turn our attention to the problems that plague us at home.\n\nWe have wars to fight, wars that are closer to home: poverty, inequality, and disease. We have children who go hungry, who go without healthcare, and who suffer in the shadows of our great cities. These are the wars that we should be fighting, the wars that we should be winning. But no, we choose to fight a foreign war, a war that has lost its purpose, a war that has become a drain on our economy and our very soul.\n\nLet us end this war, let us bring our troops home, and let us turn our attention to the problems that truly matter. We are a nation that has lost its way, a nation that has forgotten its purpose. It is time to rediscover ourselves, to rediscover our values, and to rediscover our humanity.",
            "In a world where every step is a calculated risk, every digital footprint a potential landmine, one must consider the price of prying eyes. The notion that a life could be saved due to some stranger's curiosity on a site like Myspace is a double-edged sword. It cuts both ways: a blessing and a curse.\n\nThe nature of the internet is a labyrinth, a maze of interconnected threads where anyone can twist and turn to reveal the deepest recesses of a person's soul. The notion that one must accept a stranger as a \"friend\" in order to see their profile is a Faustian bargain. In doing so, one surrenders a piece of themselves, a fragment of their innermost thoughts and desires. It's a vulnerability that can be exploited by those with ill intent.\n\nThe internet, a double-edged sword, can be both a tool for connection and a breeding ground for predators. The ease with which one can uncover a person's deepest fears and desires is a chilling thought. A stranger can uncover a person's screen name, their class schedule, their social circle – the entire tapestry of their life. The notion that anyone can see these things, whether by design or chance, is a heavy burden to bear.\n\nThe school's decision to ban students from having a Myspace may seem like an overreach, a restriction on personal freedom. But in a world where the internet is a minefield, perhaps such measures are necessary. The line between privacy and prying eyes is a thin one, and in the world we live in, it's a line that's constantly being tested.\n\nThe ease with which one can be watched, monitored, and manipulated is a stark reminder of the dangers of the digital age. The notion that some people would seek to exploit this vulnerability for their own gain is a sobering thought. And yet, the allure of connection, of community, is a powerful draw. It's a delicate balance, one that's fraught with peril and uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it's a question of how much one is willing to sacrifice for the sake of connection. Is it worth the risk of being watched, of being vulnerable to those who would do us harm? The answer, like the internet itself, is a labyrinth of contradictions, a maze with no clear exit.",
            "The words falter on the tongue like autumn leaves on a gust of wind. The Iraq War. A calamity born of hubris and folly. I confess, I wince at the thought of speaking out against it now. It's a betrayal of the cynicism that's become so fashionable. But the numbers don't lie. Seventy-five percent, eighty percent - the world, the Iraqis themselves, even the troops on the ground - all in agreement: a grave mistake, a catastrophe foretold.\n\nThe polls reveal a stark truth: we've been wrong from the start. The Middle East, a labyrinth of ancient rivalries and tribal certainties, cannot be remade in our image. The notion that democracy can be imposed, like a foreign skin grafted onto a body that rejects it, is a delusion. The civil war that raged before our arrival has become a mere precursor to the chaos that followed.\n\nSaddam, a monster, to be sure, but a contained one. His removal has unleashed a maelstrom, a desert sandstorm that swallows all in its path. The administration's promises of a brighter future, a beacon of freedom, have proven hollow. The people of Iraq have spoken, and their words are a stark rebuke to our presence: leave now, leave soon, leave forever.\n\nI'm not naive to the perils of withdrawal, the potential for power vacuums and bloodshed. But what's the alternative? To perpetuate a war that's lost its legitimacy, to prop up a puppet government that's a mere shadow of its former self? No, the time for excuses is over. We've heard the whispers of the Iraqis, and it's time to heed their words.\n\nThe notion that we can somehow salvage this debacle, that we can impose our will on a people who've rejected it, is a fantasy. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But perhaps, just perhaps, we can take the first step towards redemption by acknowledging our mistakes, by recognising that our presence has done more harm than good.\n\nThe wind howls through the deserts, a mournful sigh for a war that should never have been waged. The numbers don't lie. It's time to listen to the voices of the Iraqis, to respect their will. Leave now, and let the people of that shattered land begin to rebuild.",
            "The darkness of inequality still lingers in the United States, a specter that refuses to be vanquished. It seeps into every corner of our society, its tendrils snaking through the very fabric of our being. The shadows of gender discrimination persist, a legacy of a bygone era that continues to cast a pall over the opportunities of women and men alike.\n\nIn the world of work, the glass ceiling remains a formidable obstacle, a barrier that prevents women from rising to positions of power. The bias of a society that has long been skewed in favor of men means that even when women possess the qualifications and skills necessary for a particular role, they are often overlooked in favor of their male counterparts. This is not a phenomenon unique to women, however; men too are subject to the whims of societal expectations, forced to conform to traditional roles that stifle their potential.\n\nIn the rarefied world of fashion, men who dare to express themselves through the medium of clothing are often met with skepticism and dismissal. Their interests are seen as frivolous, their tastes suspect. It is a double standard that is both baffling and infuriating, a testament to the enduring power of societal norms.\n\nBut it is not just the workplace or the world of fashion that is affected by these biases. In the private sphere, families are often judged and criticized for their choices regarding childcare and domestic responsibilities. The notion that men are solely responsible for providing for their families, while women are relegated to the role of caregiver, is a tired and outdated one. And yet, it persists, a weight that presses down upon those who dare to defy convention.\n\nTo change this entrenched mindset is a slow and difficult process. Progress is incremental, a crawl forward in the face of entrenched opposition. But progress it is, nonetheless. Women are rising to positions of power, breaking down barriers and shattering glass ceilings. Men are redefining what it means to be a father, embracing their roles as caregivers and breadwinners. And in the world of fashion, the boundaries between men and women are becoming increasingly blurred.\n\nBut change is a fragile thing, easily derailed by those who cling to the status quo. It requires a delicate touch, a subtle navigation of the complex web of societal norms and expectations. It demands that we confront our own biases, that we challenge our assumptions and confront the shadows within ourselves. And it requires patience, a willingness to accept that progress will be slow and incremental.\n\nAs we move forward, it is essential that we recognize the complexities of the issue, that we acknowledge the ways in which societal expectations can create barriers and biases. We must be willing to confront our own prejudices, to challenge the norms and expectations that have been ingrained in us. And we must be patient, knowing that change will take time, that progress will be slow and tortuous.\n\nIn the end, it is not the pace of change that matters, but the direction. For it is in the slow, incremental steps forward that we find the true power of progress. And it is in the willingness to confront our own biases, to challenge the shadows within ourselves, that we find the courage to move forward, to create a brighter, more just future for all.",
            "The notion of legalization. They'd dismantled the edifice of law, reduced it to a whim, a trifling matter, not unlike a traffic infraction. A citation, a paltry fine, and a whispered warning, rather than the stern visage of the law, its icy grip, its unyielding weight. And yet, the specter of consequence lingers, a ghostly presence, a shadow that haunts the waking hours, a specter that refuses to be exorcised.\n\nIn the ledger of the municipal coffers, the cost of prosecution, a formidable column, a weighty burden, a drain on the till. The machinery of justice, a behemoth, a leviathan, that consumes and devours, its appetite insatiable, its belly always growling. And so, the calculus of prudence, a delicate balance, a dance of fiscal responsibility, a waltz of thrift and frugality.\n\nIn Denver, a city of open hearts and minds, a bastion of progress, a beacon of enlightenment, the scales of justice, a seesaw, a balance, a delicate equilibrium, have been adjusted. The municipal treasury, a bulging purse, overflowing with the riches of liberation, the coin of freedom, the currency of possibility.\n\nBut, like a cautionary tale, a whispered warning, a ghostly presence, the specter of excess, a shadowy figure, lurks in the wings, a reminder that even in the land of the free, the chains of habit, the shackles of addiction, the fetters of dependence, still bind and entwine.\n\nAnd so, the dialectic of debate, a seesaw, a balance, a delicate equilibrium, continues, a dance of reason and prudence, a waltz of moderation and restraint. For in the realm of the substance, a duplicitous realm, a Janus-faced creature, a shape-shifter, a chameleon, no two reactions are the same, no two outcomes, no two fates.\n\nThe tapestry of human experience, a complex weave, a rich brocade, a fabric of diverse threads, a kaleidoscope of perspectives, a mosaic of reactions, a symphony of responses. And so, we are left to ponder, to deliberate, to weigh and measure, the pros and cons, the merits and demerits, the pluses and minuses, the advantages and disadvantages, the benefits and the detriments.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of individual discretion, a matter of personal choice, a matter of free will, a matter of moral agency. For, like the whispered warning, the ghostly presence, the shadowy figure, the specter of excess, the chains of habit, the shackles of addiction, still lurk, still wait, still whisper in the darkness, a reminder that even in the land of the free, the choices we make, the paths we choose, the roads we take, are ours to own, ours to bear, ours to suffer.",
            "In response to the question, I would say yes. It is a conviction born of habit, a reflex honed by repetition. We adhere to the traditional ways, the tried and true. The Church's dogma, a labyrinth of rigid doctrine, has shaped our actions for generations. Yet, it is also vital to be malleable, to adapt to the changing tides. The Catholic Church's adherence to long-held practices can be both a blessing and a curse.\n\nLike a well-worn path, their rituals have been trod for centuries. The faithful attend Mass each week, a steadfast devotion to the faith. However, an unyielding rigidity can be stifling, weighing heavily on those who falter or stray. The notion of a perfect Catholic, one who adheres to the doctrine without blemish, can be a crushing burden. And the Church's intolerance of other faiths, of those who do not subscribe to its strictures, is a stain on its reputation.\n\nThe example of my parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, serves as a poignant reminder of this. Their union, deemed unacceptable by the Catholic Church, highlights the very contradiction at the heart of Catholicism. The principles of love and acceptance, core tenets of the faith, are oftentimes at odds with the Church's actions.\n\nAllowing priests to marry, a notion often bandied about, would not necessarily stem the tide of pedophilia. These are individuals who have chosen a path of aberrant behavior, one that transcends the bonds of matrimony. Their predilections are not so easily swayed by the prospect of a spouse.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that holds the key, but rather a fundamental shift in the human heart. The capacity for compassion, for empathy, and for understanding – these are the qualities that must be nurtured, not the strictures of a bygone era.",
            "The line between the state and the church, a chasm so narrow it's often lost in the haze. The question of marriage, a labyrinth with no clear exit. One path leads to the sacred, the other to the mundane. It's a conundrum that defies resolution, a paradox that gnaws at the very fabric of our being.\n\nI find myself adrift, unable to anchor my thoughts in the midst of this tempest. The waters are treacherous, with currents of opinion swirling in every direction. Some claim the government should not intrude upon the sacred, that marriage is a matter of the heart and soul. Others argue that it is the state's duty to define and protect this most fundamental of human bonds.\n\nBut what of the civil union? Is it not the same as marriage, merely a label we apply to two people bound together by love and commitment? Should we not treat them with the same respect, the same dignity, regardless of their station or persuasion? Yet, we must be cautious, lest we tread upon the sacred precincts of the church, lest we offend those who hold dear the traditions of the past.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the matter of gay marriage. A contentious issue, to say the least. Some see it as a mere aberration, a deviation from the natural order of things. Others argue that it is a fundamental right, one that should be protected and celebrated. I am drawn to neither extreme, but rather to a middle ground, a place where love and acceptance reign supreme.\n\nBut should the constitution be amended to ban gay marriage? I think not. Such a change would be a heavy-handed solution, one that would sow discord and division rather than bring people together. The constitution is a sacred document, a blueprint for our nation's ideals and aspirations. It should not be used as a tool for the petty squabbles of the masses.\n\nIn the end, it is not the label that matters, but the love and commitment that lies beneath. Let us not be swayed by the whims of fashion or the dictates of the powerful. Let us instead strive for a world where love is the only guiding principle, a world where two people can come together in the full knowledge that their bond is cherished and respected.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has instilled in me a complex understanding of the issues surrounding homosexuality. As I have formed friendships with individuals from diverse backgrounds, I have come to see the nuance in this matter. While I don't necessarily condone the lifestyle, I firmly believe that it should be legalized, allowing individuals to live freely in accordance with their desires.\n\nThe notion that the president should dictate a national stance on this issue seems misguided. Instead, I propose that each state should have the autonomy to decide for itself. This approach acknowledges the varied perspectives and values of different regions, as some states lean towards democratic ideologies, while others hold more conservative views. If an individual chooses to reside in a state that has legalized gay marriage, it is their responsibility to respect the decision made by the collective.\n\nMy stance is not one of opposition to the idea of equal opportunities for homosexuals. Rather, I believe that the decision to legalize or prohibit gay marriage should be left to the individual states, allowing them to govern themselves accordingly. This approach also acknowledges the impermanence of presidential power, as a new administration may reverse the decisions of its predecessor.\n\nAs the country is comprised of diverse states with distinct values, it is essential to recognize that the president cannot possibly represent the views of every citizen. In this context, it is reasonable to entrust the decision-making power to the states, which will be directly affected by the outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the legalization of gay marriage should be a decision left to the individual states, rather than a national mandate. This approach respects the diversity of the country and acknowledges the complex nature of this issue.",
            "The notion that posting on a public platform such as Myspace is somehow private is a notion that refuses to yield to reason. The very nature of the beast, as it were, is to broadcast one's thoughts and musings to the world at large. It is akin to whispering into the void, save that the void, in this case, is a vast expanse of interconnected humanity, each one of us a node in the grand tapestry of the internet.\n\nAnd so, when a student posts something on Myspace, they must be prepared to confront the possibility that their words will be seen by others, including school officials. The notion that these officials have no right to peruse such postings is a naive one, for they are but a mere drop in the ocean of humanity, connected to the world at large by the very same threads that bind us all.\n\nBut, as with all things, there is a balance to be struck. On one hand, the school officials have a duty to maintain a safe and secure environment for their students. And if that means monitoring the online activities of those students, so be it. It is a small price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with knowing that one's child is safe from the ravages of the world.\n\nAnd yet, there is a fine line to be walked here. For if the officials are merely using the internet as a means to catch students in the act of wrongdoing, then that is an invasion of privacy, pure and simple. But if their actions are motivated by a desire to create a safer environment, then perhaps they are doing what is necessary.\n\nThe example of school drills, such as those conducted in response to the threat of terrorist attacks, is instructive here. In those cases, the school officials are taking proactive measures to prepare for the worst-case scenario, and in doing so, they are creating a safer environment for all. It is the same with monitoring online activity - if it is done with the intention of preventing harm, then it is a necessary evil.\n\nBut, as with all things, there is a darker side to this coin. For once something is posted online, it is there forever, waiting to be discovered by those who would do us harm. And it is a sobering thought, indeed, to consider that even as an adult, one's past mistakes can come back to haunt them, like a specter from the grave.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance that must be struck. On one hand, we have the right to free expression, but on the other, we have the duty to protect ourselves and others from harm. It is a balance that is not always easy to maintain, but it is one that we must strive for, lest we succumb to the very real dangers that lurk in the shadows of the internet.",
            "The weight of memory hung in the air like the ashes that clung to every surface. It was as if the very fabric of the world had been torn asunder, leaving only the bleak and barren expanse of regret. The sting of nine eleven still lingered, a festering wound that would not heal. I had been drawn to the conflict like a moth to flame, driven by a mix of emotions and misplaced idealism. The fervor of the moment had consumed me, and I had been blind to the consequences.\n\nBut time had passed, and with it, a measure of clarity. I saw now that we had gone to war with a lack of foresight and planning, driven by rage and a desire for revenge. We had been unprepared for the complexities of the conflict, and the people of that land were not the enemies we had made them out to be. They were a people consumed by their own internal struggles, their own savagery, and we had only added to their woe.\n\nI thought of the President's words, the declarations of war, the promises of a better future. But it was all a facade, a thin veil hiding the truth. We had gone to war with a messianic zeal, convinced that we could remake the world in our image. But we were not gods, and our efforts had only served to further destabilize the region.\n\nI thought of the people, their faces twisted in anger and hatred, their bodies worn down by the endless struggle. They were not our enemies, they were our mirror, reflecting back the darkness that lurked within ourselves. And we had only added to their pain, our presence a constant reminder of the chaos we had unleashed.\n\nI did not know what the future held, but I knew that we could not stay. The war had been a blight, a cancer that had consumed everything in its path. We had to leave, to let the people of that land pick up the pieces and rebuild. It was a bitter truth, but one that I had come to accept. We had been wrong to go to war, and we had to be wrong to stay.\n\nThe weight of memory still lingered, but I had come to see it for what it was – a reminder of our folly, a warning to future generations. We had been blinded by our emotions, our desire for revenge, and our arrogance. But we had to learn from our mistakes, to acknowledge the harm we had caused, and to leave the people of that land to their own Devices.\n\nI did not know what the future held, but I knew that we had to let go. We had to release the burden of our guilt, our anger, and our regret. We had to leave the war behind, to forge a new path, one that was guided by wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the complexities of the world. It was a difficult truth, but one that I had come to accept – we had to leave, and we had to let go."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church stands as a bastion of tradition, its views a testament to the timeless and the unyielding. Yet, in a world where the certainties of the past are slowly receding into the mists of time, it finds itself beset on all sides by the whispers of a changing world. The once-mighty edifice of its influence begins to crumble, its foundations weakened by the weight of its own rigidity. The Church's stance on matters of marriage, life, and death - issues that have come to be seen as relics of a bygone era - only serve to further erode its hold on the faithful.\n\nIt is a truth both plain and unvarnished: the Church's adherence to its ancient dogma has become a barrier, a moat that separates it from the world it seeks to serve. The issue of gay marriage, the contentious topic of abortion, and the question of birth control - all these and more have become focal points of contention, dividing the faithful from those who would follow a more progressive path. The Church's stance on these matters is seen as anachronistic, a relic of a world that no longer exists.\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between right and wrong are increasingly fluid, the Church's absolutism only serves to alienate it from those who would seek to follow its teachings. The faithful are forced to choose between their conscience and their faith, a choice that has become increasingly difficult to make. And so, they turn away, disillusioned by the Church's refusal to adapt to the changing world.\n\nThe question of female priests and married clergy is a curious one. Would the presence of women in the priesthood, or the ability of priests to form families, have altered the course of events? It is impossible to say. Yet, it is clear that the Church's refusal to consider these possibilities has only served to further distance it from the modern world.\n\nThe notion that priests are married to God, and thus devoted to a life of celibacy, is a noble one. But it is a notion that no longer resonates with those who live in a world where the boundaries between the spiritual and the secular are increasingly blurred. The idea that priests, like all men, should be free to form families and love in all its forms, is a notion that seems almost quaint, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIn the end, it is not the Church's views that are the problem, but its inability to change, to adapt to the shifting sands of time. As the world moves forward, leaving the certainties of the past behind, the Church stands frozen in time, a monument to a bygone era. And it is this, more than anything, that threatens to erode its influence, to leave it a relic of a world that no longer exists.",
            "The notion of marriage, that most sacred of human institutions, had long been a subject of contemplation for me. As I pondered the issue of gay marriage, I found myself drawn to a singular truth - that the essence of a person's being, their very identity, is not something chosen but rather an inherent part of their being. Like the rusting hulks of abandoned cars, their sexual inclination is a fact of existence, unshaped by the whims of conscious deliberation.\n\nIn this desolate landscape of human experience, I firmly believed that individuals should not be held accountable for the immutable aspects of their nature. The idea of assigning blame or culpability to those born with a predisposition towards same-sex attraction struck me as a hollow, misguided endeavor. It was akin to condemning a tree for its roots, or a river for its course.\n\nAs I walked the barren roads of this world, I began to see the issue of gay marriage not as a matter of law or morality, but rather as a fundamental question of humanity. Should the federal government, that great arbiter of our collective destiny, intervene in the most intimate aspects of our lives? I thought not. Their reach, much like the withered branches of a dead tree, exceeded their grasp, and they had no business dictating the terms of love and companionship.\n\nIn the end, it was not a question of right or wrong, but of compassion and understanding. The federal government's involvement in the matter seemed a hollow exercise, a futile attempt to impose order on the chaos of human experience. I saw gay people not as aberrations, but as fellow travelers on this journey we call life, deserving of the same dignity and respect as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nAs I sat beneath the darkening sky, surrounded by the skeletal remains of a world that once was, I knew that the issue of gay marriage was not about politics or ideology, but about the human heart. And in that heart, I saw a deep wellspring of love and acceptance, a wellspring that transcended the petty boundaries of man-made law.\n\nIn the silence of the night, I knew that I would stand for the freedom to love, for the right to be oneself, without fear of reprisal or condemnation. For in the end, it was not a question of what we are, but who we are, and the love that we share.",
            "A notion persists, a notion that the union of two individuals, their bond sanctioned by the state, should be limited to those of like kind. Yet, it is a notion bereft of substance, a notion born of fear and misunderstanding. The truth is, the institution of marriage, stripped of its sacred connotations, is little more than a legal arrangement, a social contract between two consenting adults.\n\nIt is a notion that the couple who walk among us, their love and commitment unwavering, are somehow less than those bound by tradition and convention. But what is the basis for this distinction? Is it not the same tender love, the same unyielding devotion that sustains us all? The notion that homosexuals pose a threat to the heterosexual family is a fallacy, a myth perpetuated by those who would seek to impose their will upon others.\n\nThe family is not a static entity, a monolith of tradition and expectation. It is a dynamic, ever-changing entity, shaped by the individuals who comprise it. And yet, we seek to impose upon it a singular definition, a definition that excludes the love and commitment of those who do not fit our narrow mold.\n\nThe civil rights that accompany marriage are not a privilege, but a necessity. They are the rights to property, to healthcare, to the comfort of a loved one's presence in times of need. To deny these rights to a couple, simply because their love is not sanctioned by tradition, is to deny them their very humanity.\n\nBut the issue at hand is not one of morality, for morality is a complex and multifaceted thing. It is a tapestry of differing perspectives, woven from the threads of experience, culture, and personal conviction. To impose one morality upon another, to silence the voices of those who would speak out against oppression, is to act with a zealot's fervor, a zealot's disregard for the diversity of human experience.\n\nThe government, in its role as guardian of the law, should not seek to impose its will upon the people, but rather, it should seek to protect their rights, to ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. The amendment that would ban gay marriage is a misguided attempt to impose a singular morality upon a pluralistic society, a society that values diversity and inclusivity above all else.\n\nIt is a notion that has been perpetuated by those who would seek to control the narrative, to impose their will upon others. But it is a notion that is rooted in fear, in a fear of the unknown, of the unfamiliar. And it is a notion that is at odds with the principles of justice, of equality, and of compassion.\n\nThe American Psychological Association has spoken out against the notion that homosexuality is a result of trauma or personality defect. It is a notion that is based on misinformation, on incomplete understanding. And it is a notion that is rooted in a desire to control, to dictate the terms of human experience.\n\nIn the end, it is not the government's place to impose its will upon the people. It is not the government's place to dictate what is moral or just. It is the government's place to protect the rights of all individuals, to ensure that all are treated with dignity and respect. And it is the people's place to demand that their government serve the greater good, to serve the principles of justice, equality, and compassion.",
            "The fire of conviction burns within me, a flame that flickers with each consideration of the medicinal properties of a certain substance, one oft-maligned and feared by the masses. In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy where I toil during the summer months, I've come to know the value of such substances. The narcs, the barbiturates, the lysergics - all these and more are staples of our dispensary, held dear for their utility in alleviating suffering and pain. And yet, their illicit status seems to have fostered an aura of taboo, a misconception that these substances are inherently wrong.\n\nBut what of the oxycodone, the Vicodin, the Perocets? Are they not controlled substances, used by our pharmacy with deliberate intent, their benefits weighed against the risks? And is it not folly to deny the medicinal properties of a substance merely because it's been outlawed? The parallels with alcohol are clear - both can be abused, both can exact a terrible toll on the user. Yet, we find no qualm in allowing alcohol to remain legal, its dangers mitigated by education and moderation.\n\nThe key, I believe, lies in gradual integration, in allowing the taboo to erode slowly, that the true nature of the substance may be revealed. For it's not the substance itself that's the problem, but the perceptions that surround it. The image of marijuana as a destructive force, a scourge on society, needs to be shattered. It's a notion born of fear and misinformation, one that's been perpetuated by the very laws that prohibit its use.\n\nIf we could strip away this stigma, this misconception, perhaps people might approach marijuana with a more nuanced view, one that acknowledges its potential benefits, its utility in alleviating suffering. And so, I say, let us reconsider our stance on this matter, and allow the truth to shine forth, unencumbered by the weight of prejudice and fear.",
            "The church had surrendered to the currents of time, its staid traditions worn smooth by the relentless tides of progress. The rigid edifices of old had given way to a more supple, adaptable form. Gone were the days of Sunday finery, of stiff collars and neatly coiffed hair. Now, the faithful donned casual attire, as if the weight of piety had been shed like a worn cloak.\n\nSummer Sundays saw families stumble in, beachwear a stark testament to the languid ease of their morning routine. The morning masses, once a bastion of propriety, now played host to the egalitarian blandness of jeans and khakis. Even the once-revered tradition of dressing up for worship had given way to a more relaxed, almost careless attitude.\n\nBut amidst this shift towards a more casual, more modern expression of faith, a deeper question lingered. Could the encroaching darkness that had besmirched the church's name have been averted if the institution had been willing to bend, to adapt? The specter of pedophilia, a plague that had afflicted the very heart of the church, seemed to mock the idea of change.\n\nSome argued that the issue lay not with the priest's marital status, but with the darkness that lurked within their own hearts. That even marriage, even the sacred bond of matrimony, could not inoculate against the allure of the young and vulnerable. Others posited that the problem lay deeper still, that the very nature of the individual was predetermined, a product of genetics and biology rather than environment or upbringing.\n\nIn the end, it seemed that the church's staid traditions, its adherence to a bygone era, had only served to conceal the rot that had taken hold. The question remained: could anything have been done to prevent the catastrophe, or was it an inevitable consequence of human nature, a darkness that lurked within every soul, waiting to be unleashed?\n\nAs one pondered this question, a sense of despair crept in, a feeling that the very fabric of faith had been irreparably torn asunder. The church, once a beacon of hope, now seemed a shadow of its former self, a testament to the transience of human endeavor.\n\nIn the end, it seemed that the only thing that could have prevented the darkness was a willingness to confront it, to confront the very nature of humanity itself. But even that seemed a distant, perhaps impossible, hope.",
            "The embers of outrage still smolder within me, a flame that refuses to be extinguished by the passage of time. It was a day like any other when the towers fell, their steel and concrete spires crumbling to the ground like shattered icons. The world, it seemed, was forever changed. And yet, in the aftermath, a darkness descended, a shroud that clung to the land like a damp and heavy mist. The drums of war beat out a cadence, a rhythm that struck a discordant note in my heart.\n\nThe Bush administration, a wolf in sheep's clothing, led the charge, their words dripping with deceit like honeyed poison. They spoke of WMDs and bin Laden, their assertions as hollow as the promises of a faithless suitor. The silence that followed was oppressive, a heavy blanket that suffocated all dissent. Even Colin Powell, that paragon of integrity, later confessed to his own doubts, a whispered admission that only served to underscore the depths of the administration's malfeasance.\n\nTheir disregard for the Constitution was a blight, a cancer that infected the very fabric of our democracy. They sought to marginalize it, to reduce it to a relic of a bygone era, a relic to be dismissed with a wave of their hand. And all the while, the drums of war continued to beat, a relentless cadence that echoed through the land like a dirge.\n\nBut the truth, like a slow-moving fire, began to spread, a creeping flame that illuminated the darkness. The Secretary of the Treasury, a Cassandra of sorts, spoke out against the administration's designs, his words like a warning cry in the wilderness. The younger Bush, driven by a bloodlust, a vendetta against Saddam Hussein, a man whose name had become a rallying cry for the administration's base. And all the while, the energy interests, like a serpent in the grass, whispered sweet nothings in the president's ear, their influence like a corrupting stain.\n\nThe war, a pyre of burning embers, continued to smolder, casting a shadow over the land. The UN, that bastion of international cooperation, sought to intervene, to bring order to the chaos. But the alternative, a coalition of nations, a patchwork quilt of interests, threatened to unravel the very fabric of Iraq's sovereignty. The Parliament, a fragile reed, bent beneath the weight of competing interests, its effectiveness a distant memory. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, impotent in the face of factional infighting, his authority a fiction.\n\nAnd yet, amidst the chaos, a glimmer of hope flickered, a chance for redemption, a chance to right the wrongs of the past. But like a will-o'-the-wisp, it beckoned, only to vanish into the darkness, leaving behind a trail of ash and regret.\n\nIn the end, it was not the words of the wise that guided us, but the fires of passion, the embers of outrage that still smolder within me, a flame that refuses to be extinguished. For in the darkness, there is always a glimmer of light, a spark that refuses to be snuffed out, a reminder that even in the depths of despair, there is always a way forward, a path that winds its way through the ashes, a path that leads to a brighter dawn.",
            "He spoke, the words gurgling up from the depths of his throat like a stagnant spring, but they lacked conviction, lacking the cadence of truth. They hung in the air, a listless mist that clung to nothing, offered no solace to those who listened. \n\nI did, he said, his voice a monotone drone, devoid of emotion.\n\nThe boy's gaze drifted away, as if searching for a thread to follow, a path to follow through the labyrinth of his thoughts. And then, with a softness that seemed almost painful, he replied, Just talk into it? \n\nThe man's eyes, red-rimmed from the weariness of the world, lifted to meet the boy's, and he nodded, a faint smile creasing his lips. Ok. \n\nThe words spilled out of him, a jumbled mess of thoughts and feelings, like autumn leaves blown by the wind. Ok cool. Uh huh. Uh. The sentences twisted and turned, a contradictory tangle of opinions, each one canceling out the last. \n\nA war in Iraq. Let me see. He searched for the words, but they eluded him, hidden behind a screen of uncertainty. At this point I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually. The words hung in the air, a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down. \n\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S. Like who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven. The past and the present collided, a jarring dissonance that left him reeling. \n\nSo I don't feel like... He trailed off, lost in the depths of his own confusion. I don't know the big details of it. But at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing. And then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them. The words dripped with a cynicism that was almost palpable. \n\nBut it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset. So... And then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day. And then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. \n\nThe words tumbled out of him, a jumbled mess of half-truths and misconceptions. He was adrift, lost in a sea of uncertainty. Um... Let me see... Ohh this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um... War in Iraq... Oh this hard. Uh... Mmm. Uhh... I don't know... Do you have anything else I can go off of? \n\nThe boy's gaze drifted away, lost in thought, as the man's words hung in the air, a fragile, flickering flame that threatened to extinguish itself at any moment. Ok. Thank you. Um... Well um... Actually I think... I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore. But because I don't think that... You know... I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that... You know... That we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns. \n\nBut I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore. Because like we didn't even call it... It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place. Because it never was declared a war by congress. I think that's how the whole thing works. You have to declare a war by congress. And then it's... I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try...\n\nThe words twisted and turned, a contradictory tangle of opinions, each one canceling out the last. Actually no... I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them. But it's also like wasting our resources. And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like... It's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now... Because of like what it's doing and it's like... And what it's doing to like... Cause remember... I think with the whole Vietnam thing... Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war... And he's like saying... He'll be called like that president forever... That he started this meaningless war and stuff...\n\nThe words hung in the air, a challenge, a gauntlet thrown down. Huh... You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh... Ok yeah... Um... Huh... I guess you could also say that it is... Like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in... Whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like... These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took... I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other... Just because of like the different beliefs that they have...\n\nBut then again... It's like... It's hard to say... I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States... That it's going to be even worse for them... And it's going to be... Like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them... And they've been going on this whole like... Um... Totalitarian... Like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that... You know... I feel like it's gonna... That it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there...\n\nThe words trailed off, a dying ember, flickering in the darkness. Hmm... That's about it. Ok.",
            "The words faltered on his lips like autumn leaves in the wind. He searched for the clarity that eluded him. The notion of legality, a concept forged in the fire of statecraft, seemed to him a hollow thing. It was a notion that sought to impose itself upon the sacred, to bind the unbindable. He thought of the constitution, that hallowed document, and the words that spoke of separation between church and state. A clear declaration, one that had stood the test of time. And yet, he wondered, how could one faith be elevated above others, its tenets enshrined in law, while the rest were left to wither in the shadows? The Catholics, the Christians, they were divided on this issue, their voices raised in discord. And yet, the government, that great Leviathan, sought to impose its will, to dictate what was permissible and what was not.\n\nThe memory of his uncle's words echoed in his mind, a mantra of freedom. \"Separation of church and state,\" he had said, \"is the very bulwark of our liberty.\" And what of the amendment, that proposed restriction on the people? It was a contradiction, a negation of the very principles that had given birth to this nation. A restriction, not on the government, but on the people, a people who had been promised freedom from the tyranny of the state.\n\nHe thought of the president, a man driven by his own convictions, his own faith. But what of the rest? What of the diversity of faiths, the multiplicity of belief? Should one be allowed to impose its will upon the many? He did not think so. The churches, not the government, should be the guardians of faith. And as for the argument that this amendment would boost the economy, he was skeptical. What of the society? Would it not be a society more fragmented, more divided, by such a law?\n\nIn the end, he had said little. His words had faltered, his thoughts unclear. But he knew what he believed. The government should not intervene in matters of faith. The churches, not the state, should be the arbiters of the sacred. And so, he remained silent, his voice lost in the wind, his thoughts a whispered prayer for the freedom to believe.",
            "In the void of our existence, we find ourselves entangled in the threads of a war that wears on like a festering wound. The invasion of Iraq, a calamity born of deceit and half-truths, left an indelible stain on the conscience of our nation. We were sold a bill of goods, a promise of liberation and freedom, but what we reaped was chaos and desolation. The government, driven by a hunger for power and resources, cloaked its true motivations beneath a veil of patriotism and vengeance.\n\nThe link between the 9/11 attacks and the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, yet we were convinced otherwise. The nation's outrage, a wellspring of emotional fervor, was expertly manipulated to justify the preemptive strike. But as we now know, the wounds of war run deeper than the scars of a terrorist attack.\n\nThe parallels between Iraq and Vietnam are striking. Both wars were fought on the battlefield of hubris and misunderstanding, with our government repeating the mistakes of the past, blind to the lessons of history. The toll of American lives lost, a staggering number, serves as a grim reminder of the folly of our actions. We removed a government, only to be unprepared for the aftermath, leaving a power vacuum that spawned chaos and insurgency.\n\nWe were sold a narrative of a swift, decisive victory, but the truth is far more complex. The struggle for democracy is a long and arduous one, a journey that requires patience, wisdom, and a deep understanding of the land and its people. Our government's naivety and shortsightedness led us down a path of destruction, with the Iraqi people paying the ultimate price.\n\nAs I reflect on the decision to invade Iraq, I am reminded of the words of my uncle, who spoke of the impermanence of all things. We were asked to believe that a new government, born in the ashes of the old, would flourish under our guidance. But the truth is that democracy is a fragile thing, easily crushed by the weight of our own hubris.\n\nToday, as we look upon the devastation of Iraq, we see the ghosts of our own making. The war has left us with more questions than answers, more scars than scars can heal. We were deceived, and in our wake, we have left a nation in tatters. The oil, the resources, the politics – all of these played their part in our decision-making, but at what cost?\n\nAs I write these words, I am filled with a sense of unease, a sense of foreboding. The war in Iraq will not be won, not in the way we had hoped. It will not be a victory of freedom, but a Pyrrhic one, born of blood and ashes. And as we look to the future, we must ask ourselves: what will be the cost of our mistakes? Will we learn from our errors, or will we repeat them, ad infinitum?\n\nThe war in Iraq is a testament to our own fallibility, a reminder that we are not infallible, that our decisions have consequences. As we move forward, let us remember the lessons of history, and may our actions be guided by wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the human heart.",
            "In the bleak expanse of a convoluted mind, a thought crystallized like a shard of ice. The notion that love is unbound, that it defies the arbitrary shackles of societal convention. It is a truth both simple and profound, a notion that has gnawed at the edges of my being for as long as I can recall. The acknowledgement of this truth, however, has been a slow and arduous journey, like the crawl of a worm through parched earth.\n\nThe whisper of it began in the earliest days, a tender shoot of doubt that sprouted in the dark recesses of my mind. As I navigated the twisted labyrinth of adolescence, the seed took root, spreading its tendrils deep into my very being. I came to realize that love knows no bounds, that it is a force both fierce and unyielding, impervious to the petty constraints of human law.\n\nThe world, with its pedestrian morality and rigid expectations, cannot comprehend the complexity of the human heart. It is a world that seeks to codify and categorize, to reduce the messy tapestry of human experience to neat and tidy definitions. But love, that most primal and essential of human emotions, cannot be captured within the narrow parameters of societal norms.\n\nAnd yet, I have come to understand that it is not just love that is at stake, but the very essence of humanity itself. The fragile thread of our existence is woven from a tapestry of individual experiences, each one unique and irreplaceable. To deny the validity of love, to reduce it to a mere preference or a sociological construct, is to diminish the very fabric of our humanity.\n\nI have read the words of scholars and pundits, each one attempting to explain the intricacies of the human heart. They speak of biology and sociology, of chemical imbalances and environmental factors. But I know that love is more than just a collection of abstract concepts. It is a lived experience, a pulsing, thrumming reality that courses through every vein and fiber of our being.\n\nAnd so, I find myself drawn to the conviction that love should be a personal, private matter, unencumbered by the weight of societal expectation. It is a choice, a decision that belongs to each individual, unshackled from the constraints of a world that would seek to dictate the terms of our existence.\n\nIn the end, I am left with the realization that love is not something to be debated or discussed, but something to be lived. It is a flame that burns bright and true, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems dark and unforgiving. And it is this flame that I would hold aloft, a testament to the indomitable power of the human spirit.",
            "The internet is an unforgiving expanse. A place where one's every thought, every word is laid bare for all to see. It is a public forum, a vast and unyielding tapestry of humanity's innermost musings. Once something is set loose upon its currents, it cannot be recalled. It is a burden that will cling to one like a shroud, coloring the perceptions of others, influencing their judgments. The weight of it is crushing, a constant reminder that one's words have the power to shape the world around them.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I have witnessed firsthand the perils of this digital landscape. The ease with which a careless utterance can be seized upon, taken out of context, and wielded as a weapon. The delicate balance between humor and menace, between experiment and earnest intent, is easily lost in the void. It is a minefield, a labyrinth of uncertainty, where the unwary can stumble and fall.\n\nIn our own small community, a situation arose that served as a stark reminder of the internet's unforgiving nature. A rumor, a whispered secret, was shared in the electronic ether and soon took on a life of its own. A student's words, meant as a joke, were misinterpreted as a threat, and the consequences were dire. The lesson learned was a painful one: in this public forum, there is no sanctuary, no refuge from the prying eyes of others.\n\nWhen one chooses to share their thoughts, their feelings, their innermost selves with the world, they must be prepared to face the consequences. The internet is a mirror, reflecting back our deepest fears, our darkest impulses. It is a reflection we cannot escape, a constant reminder that our words have the power to harm, to heal, to destroy.\n\nAnd yet, in this digital landscape, there is a fine line between surveillance and intrusion. The school's decision to monitor student activity on social media platforms is a complex issue, one that raises questions of invasion of privacy and the limits of authority. While it may seem intrusive to some, it is a necessary measure, a way to safeguard the well-being of the students in their care.\n\nBut let us not forget that the internet is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides a platform for connection, for community, for the sharing of ideas and experiences. On the other, it can be a breeding ground for anxiety, for fear, for the erosion of trust. The wise approach is to be mindful of one's online presence, to remember that the words we share with the world can have consequences we cannot predict.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, a precarious tightrope we walk between the freedom to express ourselves and the responsibility to consider the impact of our words. The internet is a mirror, a reflection of our collective humanity. Let us approach it with caution, with wisdom, and with a deep understanding of the power that lies within our words.",
            "It seems the war has been an endless and bloody spectacle, a spectacle that has drained the life from us. In the beginning, we were driven by a noble purpose: to bring democracy to a nation ravaged by tyranny. But the months, the years, the endless years have worn down our resolve, and in its place, a different purpose has emerged. One that is no longer about freedom, but about proving our might, about asserting our dominance over a world in ruins.\n\nWe were once a beacon of hope, a shining light in the dark. But now we stumble forward, lost in a labyrinth of our own making. The ghosts of our forebears whisper caution, reminding us of the mistakes of the past. George Bush's father, a man haunted by the demons of his own making, had quarreled with Saddam Hussein, a man as ruthless as the desert sand that consumed him. And so we went to war, driven by a purpose that was both noble and flawed.\n\nWe began with a burst of fury, a declaration of our intent to bring freedom to the oppressed. But the months turned into years, and with each passing day, our purpose grew cloudy, our motives tainted by the weight of our own self-interest. We fought for a war that was already won, a war that had been decided in the first few months. But still we persisted, driven by a will to prove our dominance, to show the world that we would not be defeated.\n\nAnd so we continued to pour blood and treasure into a conflict that had long since lost its justification. We squandered our resources on a war that was no longer about democracy, but about our own pride and ego. We chose to ignore the cries of our own people, who suffered at home while we fought a foreign war. We chose to ignore the weight of our own economy, which groaned under the burden of billions spent on a conflict that had lost its purpose.\n\nThe cost of this war has been incalculable. We have drained our coffers, our people have been killed, and our nation has been torn asunder. And for what? So that we can say we won? So that we can claim a victory that is hollow and empty? No, the time has come to end this war, to recognize that our purpose has been lost, and that we must turn our attention to the problems that plague us at home.\n\nWe have wars to fight, wars that are closer to home: poverty, inequality, and disease. We have children who go hungry, who go without healthcare, and who suffer in the shadows of our great cities. These are the wars that we should be fighting, the wars that we should be winning. But no, we choose to fight a foreign war, a war that has lost its purpose, a war that has become a drain on our economy and our very soul.\n\nLet us end this war, let us bring our troops home, and let us turn our attention to the problems that truly matter. We are a nation that has lost its way, a nation that has forgotten its purpose. It is time to rediscover ourselves, to rediscover our values, and to rediscover our humanity.",
            "In a world where every step is a calculated risk, every digital footprint a potential landmine, one must consider the price of prying eyes. The notion that a life could be saved due to some stranger's curiosity on a site like Myspace is a double-edged sword. It cuts both ways: a blessing and a curse.\n\nThe nature of the internet is a labyrinth, a maze of interconnected threads where anyone can twist and turn to reveal the deepest recesses of a person's soul. The notion that one must accept a stranger as a \"friend\" in order to see their profile is a Faustian bargain. In doing so, one surrenders a piece of themselves, a fragment of their innermost thoughts and desires. It's a vulnerability that can be exploited by those with ill intent.\n\nThe internet, a double-edged sword, can be both a tool for connection and a breeding ground for predators. The ease with which one can uncover a person's deepest fears and desires is a chilling thought. A stranger can uncover a person's screen name, their class schedule, their social circle – the entire tapestry of their life. The notion that anyone can see these things, whether by design or chance, is a heavy burden to bear.\n\nThe school's decision to ban students from having a Myspace may seem like an overreach, a restriction on personal freedom. But in a world where the internet is a minefield, perhaps such measures are necessary. The line between privacy and prying eyes is a thin one, and in the world we live in, it's a line that's constantly being tested.\n\nThe ease with which one can be watched, monitored, and manipulated is a stark reminder of the dangers of the digital age. The notion that some people would seek to exploit this vulnerability for their own gain is a sobering thought. And yet, the allure of connection, of community, is a powerful draw. It's a delicate balance, one that's fraught with peril and uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it's a question of how much one is willing to sacrifice for the sake of connection. Is it worth the risk of being watched, of being vulnerable to those who would do us harm? The answer, like the internet itself, is a labyrinth of contradictions, a maze with no clear exit.",
            "The words falter on the tongue like autumn leaves on a gust of wind. The Iraq War. A calamity born of hubris and folly. I confess, I wince at the thought of speaking out against it now. It's a betrayal of the cynicism that's become so fashionable. But the numbers don't lie. Seventy-five percent, eighty percent - the world, the Iraqis themselves, even the troops on the ground - all in agreement: a grave mistake, a catastrophe foretold.\n\nThe polls reveal a stark truth: we've been wrong from the start. The Middle East, a labyrinth of ancient rivalries and tribal certainties, cannot be remade in our image. The notion that democracy can be imposed, like a foreign skin grafted onto a body that rejects it, is a delusion. The civil war that raged before our arrival has become a mere precursor to the chaos that followed.\n\nSaddam, a monster, to be sure, but a contained one. His removal has unleashed a maelstrom, a desert sandstorm that swallows all in its path. The administration's promises of a brighter future, a beacon of freedom, have proven hollow. The people of Iraq have spoken, and their words are a stark rebuke to our presence: leave now, leave soon, leave forever.\n\nI'm not naive to the perils of withdrawal, the potential for power vacuums and bloodshed. But what's the alternative? To perpetuate a war that's lost its legitimacy, to prop up a puppet government that's a mere shadow of its former self? No, the time for excuses is over. We've heard the whispers of the Iraqis, and it's time to heed their words.\n\nThe notion that we can somehow salvage this debacle, that we can impose our will on a people who've rejected it, is a fantasy. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But perhaps, just perhaps, we can take the first step towards redemption by acknowledging our mistakes, by recognising that our presence has done more harm than good.\n\nThe wind howls through the deserts, a mournful sigh for a war that should never have been waged. The numbers don't lie. It's time to listen to the voices of the Iraqis, to respect their will. Leave now, and let the people of that shattered land begin to rebuild.",
            "The darkness of inequality still lingers in the United States, a specter that refuses to be vanquished. It seeps into every corner of our society, its tendrils snaking through the very fabric of our being. The shadows of gender discrimination persist, a legacy of a bygone era that continues to cast a pall over the opportunities of women and men alike.\n\nIn the world of work, the glass ceiling remains a formidable obstacle, a barrier that prevents women from rising to positions of power. The bias of a society that has long been skewed in favor of men means that even when women possess the qualifications and skills necessary for a particular role, they are often overlooked in favor of their male counterparts. This is not a phenomenon unique to women, however; men too are subject to the whims of societal expectations, forced to conform to traditional roles that stifle their potential.\n\nIn the rarefied world of fashion, men who dare to express themselves through the medium of clothing are often met with skepticism and dismissal. Their interests are seen as frivolous, their tastes suspect. It is a double standard that is both baffling and infuriating, a testament to the enduring power of societal norms.\n\nBut it is not just the workplace or the world of fashion that is affected by these biases. In the private sphere, families are often judged and criticized for their choices regarding childcare and domestic responsibilities. The notion that men are solely responsible for providing for their families, while women are relegated to the role of caregiver, is a tired and outdated one. And yet, it persists, a weight that presses down upon those who dare to defy convention.\n\nTo change this entrenched mindset is a slow and difficult process. Progress is incremental, a crawl forward in the face of entrenched opposition. But progress it is, nonetheless. Women are rising to positions of power, breaking down barriers and shattering glass ceilings. Men are redefining what it means to be a father, embracing their roles as caregivers and breadwinners. And in the world of fashion, the boundaries between men and women are becoming increasingly blurred.\n\nBut change is a fragile thing, easily derailed by those who cling to the status quo. It requires a delicate touch, a subtle navigation of the complex web of societal norms and expectations. It demands that we confront our own biases, that we challenge our assumptions and confront the shadows within ourselves. And it requires patience, a willingness to accept that progress will be slow and incremental.\n\nAs we move forward, it is essential that we recognize the complexities of the issue, that we acknowledge the ways in which societal expectations can create barriers and biases. We must be willing to confront our own prejudices, to challenge the norms and expectations that have been ingrained in us. And we must be patient, knowing that change will take time, that progress will be slow and tortuous.\n\nIn the end, it is not the pace of change that matters, but the direction. For it is in the slow, incremental steps forward that we find the true power of progress. And it is in the willingness to confront our own biases, to challenge the shadows within ourselves, that we find the courage to move forward, to create a brighter, more just future for all.",
            "The notion of legalization. They'd dismantled the edifice of law, reduced it to a whim, a trifling matter, not unlike a traffic infraction. A citation, a paltry fine, and a whispered warning, rather than the stern visage of the law, its icy grip, its unyielding weight. And yet, the specter of consequence lingers, a ghostly presence, a shadow that haunts the waking hours, a specter that refuses to be exorcised.\n\nIn the ledger of the municipal coffers, the cost of prosecution, a formidable column, a weighty burden, a drain on the till. The machinery of justice, a behemoth, a leviathan, that consumes and devours, its appetite insatiable, its belly always growling. And so, the calculus of prudence, a delicate balance, a dance of fiscal responsibility, a waltz of thrift and frugality.\n\nIn Denver, a city of open hearts and minds, a bastion of progress, a beacon of enlightenment, the scales of justice, a seesaw, a balance, a delicate equilibrium, have been adjusted. The municipal treasury, a bulging purse, overflowing with the riches of liberation, the coin of freedom, the currency of possibility.\n\nBut, like a cautionary tale, a whispered warning, a ghostly presence, the specter of excess, a shadowy figure, lurks in the wings, a reminder that even in the land of the free, the chains of habit, the shackles of addiction, the fetters of dependence, still bind and entwine.\n\nAnd so, the dialectic of debate, a seesaw, a balance, a delicate equilibrium, continues, a dance of reason and prudence, a waltz of moderation and restraint. For in the realm of the substance, a duplicitous realm, a Janus-faced creature, a shape-shifter, a chameleon, no two reactions are the same, no two outcomes, no two fates.\n\nThe tapestry of human experience, a complex weave, a rich brocade, a fabric of diverse threads, a kaleidoscope of perspectives, a mosaic of reactions, a symphony of responses. And so, we are left to ponder, to deliberate, to weigh and measure, the pros and cons, the merits and demerits, the pluses and minuses, the advantages and disadvantages, the benefits and the detriments.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of individual discretion, a matter of personal choice, a matter of free will, a matter of moral agency. For, like the whispered warning, the ghostly presence, the shadowy figure, the specter of excess, the chains of habit, the shackles of addiction, still lurk, still wait, still whisper in the darkness, a reminder that even in the land of the free, the choices we make, the paths we choose, the roads we take, are ours to own, ours to bear, ours to suffer.",
            "In response to the question, I would say yes. It is a conviction born of habit, a reflex honed by repetition. We adhere to the traditional ways, the tried and true. The Church's dogma, a labyrinth of rigid doctrine, has shaped our actions for generations. Yet, it is also vital to be malleable, to adapt to the changing tides. The Catholic Church's adherence to long-held practices can be both a blessing and a curse.\n\nLike a well-worn path, their rituals have been trod for centuries. The faithful attend Mass each week, a steadfast devotion to the faith. However, an unyielding rigidity can be stifling, weighing heavily on those who falter or stray. The notion of a perfect Catholic, one who adheres to the doctrine without blemish, can be a crushing burden. And the Church's intolerance of other faiths, of those who do not subscribe to its strictures, is a stain on its reputation.\n\nThe example of my parents, one a Catholic, the other an Episcopalian, serves as a poignant reminder of this. Their union, deemed unacceptable by the Catholic Church, highlights the very contradiction at the heart of Catholicism. The principles of love and acceptance, core tenets of the faith, are oftentimes at odds with the Church's actions.\n\nAllowing priests to marry, a notion often bandied about, would not necessarily stem the tide of pedophilia. These are individuals who have chosen a path of aberrant behavior, one that transcends the bonds of matrimony. Their predilections are not so easily swayed by the prospect of a spouse.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that holds the key, but rather a fundamental shift in the human heart. The capacity for compassion, for empathy, and for understanding – these are the qualities that must be nurtured, not the strictures of a bygone era.",
            "The line between the state and the church, a chasm so narrow it's often lost in the haze. The question of marriage, a labyrinth with no clear exit. One path leads to the sacred, the other to the mundane. It's a conundrum that defies resolution, a paradox that gnaws at the very fabric of our being.\n\nI find myself adrift, unable to anchor my thoughts in the midst of this tempest. The waters are treacherous, with currents of opinion swirling in every direction. Some claim the government should not intrude upon the sacred, that marriage is a matter of the heart and soul. Others argue that it is the state's duty to define and protect this most fundamental of human bonds.\n\nBut what of the civil union? Is it not the same as marriage, merely a label we apply to two people bound together by love and commitment? Should we not treat them with the same respect, the same dignity, regardless of their station or persuasion? Yet, we must be cautious, lest we tread upon the sacred precincts of the church, lest we offend those who hold dear the traditions of the past.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the matter of gay marriage. A contentious issue, to say the least. Some see it as a mere aberration, a deviation from the natural order of things. Others argue that it is a fundamental right, one that should be protected and celebrated. I am drawn to neither extreme, but rather to a middle ground, a place where love and acceptance reign supreme.\n\nBut should the constitution be amended to ban gay marriage? I think not. Such a change would be a heavy-handed solution, one that would sow discord and division rather than bring people together. The constitution is a sacred document, a blueprint for our nation's ideals and aspirations. It should not be used as a tool for the petty squabbles of the masses.\n\nIn the end, it is not the label that matters, but the love and commitment that lies beneath. Let us not be swayed by the whims of fashion or the dictates of the powerful. Let us instead strive for a world where love is the only guiding principle, a world where two people can come together in the full knowledge that their bond is cherished and respected.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has instilled in me a complex understanding of the issues surrounding homosexuality. As I have formed friendships with individuals from diverse backgrounds, I have come to see the nuance in this matter. While I don't necessarily condone the lifestyle, I firmly believe that it should be legalized, allowing individuals to live freely in accordance with their desires.\n\nThe notion that the president should dictate a national stance on this issue seems misguided. Instead, I propose that each state should have the autonomy to decide for itself. This approach acknowledges the varied perspectives and values of different regions, as some states lean towards democratic ideologies, while others hold more conservative views. If an individual chooses to reside in a state that has legalized gay marriage, it is their responsibility to respect the decision made by the collective.\n\nMy stance is not one of opposition to the idea of equal opportunities for homosexuals. Rather, I believe that the decision to legalize or prohibit gay marriage should be left to the individual states, allowing them to govern themselves accordingly. This approach also acknowledges the impermanence of presidential power, as a new administration may reverse the decisions of its predecessor.\n\nAs the country is comprised of diverse states with distinct values, it is essential to recognize that the president cannot possibly represent the views of every citizen. In this context, it is reasonable to entrust the decision-making power to the states, which will be directly affected by the outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the legalization of gay marriage should be a decision left to the individual states, rather than a national mandate. This approach respects the diversity of the country and acknowledges the complex nature of this issue.",
            "The notion that posting on a public platform such as Myspace is somehow private is a notion that refuses to yield to reason. The very nature of the beast, as it were, is to broadcast one's thoughts and musings to the world at large. It is akin to whispering into the void, save that the void, in this case, is a vast expanse of interconnected humanity, each one of us a node in the grand tapestry of the internet.\n\nAnd so, when a student posts something on Myspace, they must be prepared to confront the possibility that their words will be seen by others, including school officials. The notion that these officials have no right to peruse such postings is a naive one, for they are but a mere drop in the ocean of humanity, connected to the world at large by the very same threads that bind us all.\n\nBut, as with all things, there is a balance to be struck. On one hand, the school officials have a duty to maintain a safe and secure environment for their students. And if that means monitoring the online activities of those students, so be it. It is a small price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with knowing that one's child is safe from the ravages of the world.\n\nAnd yet, there is a fine line to be walked here. For if the officials are merely using the internet as a means to catch students in the act of wrongdoing, then that is an invasion of privacy, pure and simple. But if their actions are motivated by a desire to create a safer environment, then perhaps they are doing what is necessary.\n\nThe example of school drills, such as those conducted in response to the threat of terrorist attacks, is instructive here. In those cases, the school officials are taking proactive measures to prepare for the worst-case scenario, and in doing so, they are creating a safer environment for all. It is the same with monitoring online activity - if it is done with the intention of preventing harm, then it is a necessary evil.\n\nBut, as with all things, there is a darker side to this coin. For once something is posted online, it is there forever, waiting to be discovered by those who would do us harm. And it is a sobering thought, indeed, to consider that even as an adult, one's past mistakes can come back to haunt them, like a specter from the grave.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance that must be struck. On one hand, we have the right to free expression, but on the other, we have the duty to protect ourselves and others from harm. It is a balance that is not always easy to maintain, but it is one that we must strive for, lest we succumb to the very real dangers that lurk in the shadows of the internet.",
            "The weight of memory hung in the air like the ashes that clung to every surface. It was as if the very fabric of the world had been torn asunder, leaving only the bleak and barren expanse of regret. The sting of nine eleven still lingered, a festering wound that would not heal. I had been drawn to the conflict like a moth to flame, driven by a mix of emotions and misplaced idealism. The fervor of the moment had consumed me, and I had been blind to the consequences.\n\nBut time had passed, and with it, a measure of clarity. I saw now that we had gone to war with a lack of foresight and planning, driven by rage and a desire for revenge. We had been unprepared for the complexities of the conflict, and the people of that land were not the enemies we had made them out to be. They were a people consumed by their own internal struggles, their own savagery, and we had only added to their woe.\n\nI thought of the President's words, the declarations of war, the promises of a better future. But it was all a facade, a thin veil hiding the truth. We had gone to war with a messianic zeal, convinced that we could remake the world in our image. But we were not gods, and our efforts had only served to further destabilize the region.\n\nI thought of the people, their faces twisted in anger and hatred, their bodies worn down by the endless struggle. They were not our enemies, they were our mirror, reflecting back the darkness that lurked within ourselves. And we had only added to their pain, our presence a constant reminder of the chaos we had unleashed.\n\nI did not know what the future held, but I knew that we could not stay. The war had been a blight, a cancer that had consumed everything in its path. We had to leave, to let the people of that land pick up the pieces and rebuild. It was a bitter truth, but one that I had come to accept. We had been wrong to go to war, and we had to be wrong to stay.\n\nThe weight of memory still lingered, but I had come to see it for what it was – a reminder of our folly, a warning to future generations. We had been blinded by our emotions, our desire for revenge, and our arrogance. But we had to learn from our mistakes, to acknowledge the harm we had caused, and to leave the people of that land to their own Devices.\n\nI did not know what the future held, but I knew that we had to let go. We had to release the burden of our guilt, our anger, and our regret. We had to leave the war behind, to forge a new path, one that was guided by wisdom, compassion, and a deep understanding of the complexities of the world. It was a difficult truth, but one that I had come to accept – we had to leave, and we had to let go."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the depths of a world where shadows of doubt crept in, where the once unshakeable foundations of the Catholic Church wavered, a whispered question arose. Do they cling to the familiar, or do they surrender to the tides of change? The institution, once a bastion of tradition, now teetered on the precipice, its grip on the faithful beginning to loosen. The winds of time howled through its halls, casting aspersions on the Church's rigid stance on matters of the heart.\n\nLike a withered leaf, the Church's views on certain issues – the sanctity of life, the bonds of love, the sacraments of birth and death – seemed to cling tenuously to the branches of time, yellowed and brittle. The world outside moved forward, its pace quickening with each passing day, while the Church's stance remained frozen, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIt was said that the faithful were deserting, their numbers dwindling as the Church's rigidity only served to drive them further away. The din of dissent grew louder, a cacophony of voices that echoed through the desolate landscape of a world in flux. The Church's stance on matters of the heart seemed to be an anachronism, a stubborn refusal to bend in the face of changing times.\n\nOne could not help but wonder, in a world where love and compassion were the guiding principles, why the Church clung so tenaciously to its dogma. Why, in a world where the bonds of family and community were stretched taut, did the Church insist on its doctrine of celibacy? The question hung in the air, a challenge to the very fabric of the institution.\n\nThe winds of change howled on, a maelstrom that threatened to consume the Church whole. And yet, in the midst of the turmoil, a glimmer of hope flickered, a whispered promise that the Church might yet find a way to adapt, to bend without breaking. For in a world where love and acceptance were the keys to salvation, perhaps the Church's greatest challenge lay not in resisting the tides of change, but in embracing them.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, where the very foundations of the Church trembled, a question echoed through the void: could the Catholic Church find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the demands of a new world? Or would it succumb to the weight of its own rigidity, lost in a sea of time? Only the future held the answer, a future that hung precariously in the balance, like a leaf on the winds of change.",
            "The world is not a canvas for our petty judgments. It is a tapestry of complexities, woven from threads of fate and circumstance. And yet, we find ourselves drawn into the vortex of moral absolutes, our minds grasping for certainties in a sea of uncertainty. I, like many, have found myself adrift in this maelstrom, struggling to find footing on the shifting sands of opinion. The question of gay marriage, a topic that has gained prominence in these tumultuous times, has been a source of consternation for me.\n\nAs I ponder the issue, I am reminded of the fundamental truth that we are not born as blank slates, waiting to be inscribed with the characters of our destiny. Our very existence is a tapestry of choices and circumstances, yet there are some things that lie beyond our control. The same goes for the question of sexual orientation. It is a mystery, a labyrinth that we navigate without the benefit of a map or compass. We are not born with the choices of our lives already made, but with the capacity to forge our own path.\n\nThe notion that a person's sexual orientation is a choice, a conscious decision to defy societal norms, strikes me as a fallacy. It is a sentiment that reeks of a narrow-mindedness that seeks to impose its will on the complexities of human nature. Gay people, like all of us, are not aberrations, but rather an integral part of the human experience.\n\nTo deny them the right to marriage, to love, and to live their lives as they see fit, is to perpetuate a false narrative that we are the sole arbiters of what is right and wrong. It is a hubris that forgets that our understanding of the world is but a mere fraction of the grand tapestry. We are not the authors of the script, but merely characters in a story that is being written by forces beyond our comprehension.\n\nThe federal government, in its attempts to regulate the private lives of its citizens, oversteps its bounds. It is not our duty to impose our moral vision on others, but rather to create a society that allows individuals to live their lives as they see fit, so long as they do not harm others. It is a delicate balance, one that requires us to be mindful of our own limitations and the infinite complexities of human nature.\n\nIn the end, it is not for us to judge, but to allow. To create a world where love knows no bounds, where people can be themselves without fear of persecution or marginalization. It is a world that is not yet realized, but one that we must strive for, lest we forget the simple truth that we are all human, bound together by our shared experiences and our capacity for compassion.",
            "In the desolate expanse of this cold and forsaken land, where the tree of reason seems to wither and die, there remains a beacon of hope - the hope for equality, for the unwavering pursuit of justice, and for the unrelenting quest for truth. The issue of gay marriage is a matter of stark simplicity, a binary choice between the light of acceptance and the dark of prejudice. And yet, the fervent opposition to it is a palpable force, a maelstrom of fear and misunderstanding that threatens to consume us all.\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the institution of heterosexual marriage is a canard, a feeble excuse for the intolerance that festers in the hearts of those who cling to the status quo. The truth is, the essence of marriage is not bound by the shackles of biology, but by the indomitable spirit of love and commitment. Two individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, can form a bond that is just as strong, just as deep, and just as worthy of recognition as any other.\n\nThe defense of civil rights is not a partisan issue, nor is it a matter of personal opinion. It is a fundamental human right, a cornerstone of our democracy, and a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of compassion. The struggles of gay couples are not unlike those of any other couple - they face the same trials, the same tribulations, and the same triumphs. And it is precisely this shared humanity that we must acknowledge and celebrate, rather than deny and exclude.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a sacrosanct principle, one that has been enshrined in our Constitution. To allow the government to codify the tenets of a particular faith, be it Christianity or any other, is to invite the kind of hypocrisy that has ravaged our society for far too long. The phrase \"separate but equal\" has been used to justify the most heinous of injustices, and it is our duty to reject its pernicious influence once and for all.\n\nThe fear of the unknown, the fear of change, and the fear of difference are powerful engines of intolerance. They fuel the fires of prejudice, and they fuel the flames of hatred. But they are also the very things that we must confront, that we must overcome, and that we must vanquish if we are to create a society that is just, equitable, and fair for all.\n\nThe scientific community has spoken, and it is clear that homosexual relationships are not inherently defective, nor are they a product of childhood trauma or personal pathology. The American Psychological Association has weighed in, and its findings are unequivocal - the notion that gay people are somehow flawed or inferior is a myth, a lie, and a calumny.\n\nIn the end, it is not about politics, or ideology, or even morality. It is about humanity. It is about our capacity for compassion, our ability to empathize, and our willingness to see the world through the eyes of another. It is about recognizing that we are not so different, that we are all part of a shared human experience, and that our differences are what make us strong, not weak.\n\nSo let us not be swayed by the siren song of fear, of intolerance, and of ignorance. Let us not be deterred by the opposition of those who would seek to deny us our basic human rights. Let us stand tall, let us stand proud, and let us demand that our voices be heard. For in the end, it is not just about gay marriage - it is about the very fabric of our society, and the kind of world we want to create for ourselves and for future generations.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital, a summer's toil, I find myself entwined with the shadows of the pharmacy. The shadows cast by the fluorescent lights, a cold and unforgiving glow that seeps into the very marrow of one's bones. It is here, amidst the sterile counters and the rows of bottles, that I find myself grappling with the complexities of a world in flux. The question that hangs in the air, like a specter, is one of morality and the role of the forbidden. \n\nJust because a substance is proscribed, does it not possess some hidden virtue? Does its utility in the realm of medicine not outweigh the taboos that surround it? I think of the oxycodone and the Vicodin, the Percocet, used by my colleagues with frequency and with purpose. These are drugs, I am told, that hold no place in the world of the uninhibited. Yet, in the world of the hospital, they are nothing short of essential. The distinction, it seems to me, is a curious one.\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is a tired one. We all know the perils of excess, the ruin that can be wrought by overindulgence. But the similarities between the two substances are limited. The danger lies, I think, not in the substance itself, but in the manner of its use. Remove the stigma, the shroud of prohibition, and perhaps, just perhaps, we may find a more responsible path.\n\nThe image of marijuana, a caricature of a substance, held in the public eye, is one of degradation and decay. It is a picture of a world gone mad, of lives ruined by the very thing that might have brought solace. But is this image not a distortion? Is it not a product of our own fears and our own biases? I think of the heroin and the cocaine, the true scourges of our time. The comparison to marijuana is a false one, a convenient smokescreen designed to obscure the truth.\n\nIn the end, it is not the substance itself that is the problem, but our own perceptions, our own fears. Remove the taboos, the shrouds of prohibition, and perhaps, just perhaps, we may find a new path, a path of responsibility and of reason.",
            "The church has undergone a metamorphosis, its staid traditions yielding to the demands of the twenty-first century. The once rigid facade now appears more relaxed, a facade worn down by the gentle lapping of time. As a child, I was accustomed to Sundays spent within its hallowed halls, my attire a pristine, cookie-cutter reflection of the expectations that governed my early years. Matching dresses, shoes, and purses – a uniform that signified not only my belonging but also my devotion. Those were simpler times, ones that waned as I grew older.\n\nAt my private school, I would catch glimpses of my friends on weekends, all of us hurrying to and fro, our footsteps echoing within the church's hallowed walls. But as the years passed, the church adapted, its rituals condensed to thirty minutes, a hurried sacrifice to the pace of modern life. Summer mornings saw families arrive in beach attire, the very emblem of a world in disarray. Even morning masses, once a bastion of propriety, now welcomed the casual, the jeans and khakis a testament to a more relaxed era.\n\nAs I reflect on my experiences, I am struck by the changing times, the church a reflection of the world at large. I do not pretend to understand the inner workings of the church's politics, nor do I wish to delve into the complex web of allegations surrounding its clergy. My observations, though limited, suggest that the church's strictures did little to prevent the scourge of pedophilia.\n\nThe notion that allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference is a notion I find difficult to accept. Pedophilia, I believe, is a product of an individual's nature, a predisposition that cannot be altered by the trappings of marriage or the blessings of the church. Even in faiths that permit marriage among their clergy, the aberrant individual will still find a way to indulge their baser desires. It is a choice, a choice made by the individual, not by the institution.\n\nIn the end, it seems to me that the church's inability to prevent these atrocities lies not in its practices but in the human condition. We are what we are, our inclinations shaped by forces beyond our control, genetics a primary driver of our nature. The church, in its attempts to police the desires of its clergy, may have been misguided, but it was not the root cause of this evil.\n\nAs I reflect on the church's place in the world, I am left with more questions than answers. Its role, once a beacon of hope and guidance, now seems a complex, multifaceted entity, one that must confront the darker aspects of human nature.",
            "The ghosts of September's ash still clung to the land like the stench of death on a winter's morning. The memories of that day, like the embers of a long-dead fire, continued to smolder, refusing to be extinguished. The administration's pyre of deceit had been built upon the altar of fear, and the flames of war had consumed the nation. The rhetoric of lies had been woven like a tapestry of deceit, with Saddam Hussein as the thread, Osama Bin Laden as the hook, and the WMDs as the bait.\n\nThe echoes of Colin Powell's hollow words still lingered in the air, a haunted whisper of a man who knew the truth but chose to ignore it. The evidence, like the desert sand, had shifted and slid, revealing the cracks in the administration's facade. The Constitution, that sacred document, had been cast aside like a worn and tattered cloak, trampled by the boots of power.\n\nThe younger Bush, driven by a vendetta born of blood and pride, had set his sights on Baghdad, his eyes fixed on the prize of oil, that black gold that flowed like lifeblood through the veins of the nation. The pretext, a flimsy thing, had been used to justify the slaughter, the terror, the devastation. The world had been fooled, convinced by the sweet whispers of a lie.\n\nAnd now, as the years had passed, the truth had begun to seep through the cracks, like water through the parched earth. The country teetered on the brink of chaos, a fragile thing, balanced precariously between the competing interests of the nations that had come to claim its prize. The Iraqi government, a fragile leaf, was blown by the winds of dissension, its sovereignty threatened by the very powers that had claimed to liberate it.\n\nThe Parliament, a gathering of disparate voices, was a cacophony of discord, a reminder that the Iraqis were not a people to be trifled with. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, was a mere puppet on a string, pulled by the invisible hands of the foreign powers that had brought him to power. The shadow of al-Sadr loomed large, a specter of rebellion, a reminder that the fire of resistance still burned bright.\n\nAnd so, the nation teetered, a delicate balance of power, a house of cards waiting to be blown down. The ghosts of September still lingered, a reminder of the horrors that had been unleashed. The lies, the deceit, the bloodshed – all of it still echoed through the halls of history, a grim reminder of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "I sat in the cold, my words lost in the void. The wind howled through the trees like a mournful cry, a dirge for the lost and the forgotten. I tried to speak, but the words would not come. Just a hollow murmur, a murmur that was swallowed by the silence.\n\nI cleared my throat, and began again. The War in Iraq. A conflict without end, a morass of blood and ash. I felt a sense of futility, a sense that our efforts were as fleeting as the wind that swept through the desolate landscape.\n\nIt was a war without a clear purpose, a war without a declared end. A war born of anger and revenge, of a desire to punish and to dominate. I thought of the children, the sons and daughters lost in the conflict, their lives forever changed by the violence and the bloodshed.\n\nI thought of the terrible weight of responsibility, the burden of power that rested on the shoulders of those who had unleashed this war. The promise of democracy, of freedom and prosperity, had been reduced to a hollow mantra, a justification for the destruction and the chaos that had been wrought.\n\nAnd yet, I was torn. I felt a sense of loyalty to those who had served, who had risked everything to defend a cause that was noble and just. But I also felt a sense of unease, a sense that our presence in Iraq was a cancer, a poison that was eating away at the very fabric of the country.\n\nI thought of the words of my predecessors, the ones who had spoken of the importance of engagement, of the need to build a better world. But I knew that words were cheap, that the cost of war was measured in blood and tears, not in empty rhetoric.\n\nI sighed, my breath misting in the cold air. The War in Iraq was a labyrinth, a maze of conflicting desires and ideologies. I did not know what to say, what to think. All I knew was that I was lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty and doubt.\n\nI paused, collecting my thoughts. Perhaps, I thought, the war was not just about Iraq, but about us. About our own fears and insecurities, our own need for power and control. Perhaps it was a reflection of our own darkness, our own shadow self.\n\nI looked out at the desolate landscape, the wind-whipped trees and the ash-stained rocks. It was a landscape of death and despair, a landscape that seemed to stretch on forever. And I knew that I was just a small part of it, a small part of a larger tapestry that was torn and frayed.\n\nI fell silent, my words lost in the void. The wind howled on, a mournful cry that seemed to echo through the ages.",
            "In the desolate landscape of politics, a canonical question hangs like a specter, shrouded in the murk of constitutional ambiguity. The separation of church and state, that bedrock principle of the American foundational text, stands as a bulwark against the encroachment of ecclesiastical power into the temporal realm. And yet, a proposed amendment seeks to upset this delicate balance, to insinuate the government's hand into the very fabric of faith, a move that would contravene the sacred compact of separation.\n\nThe constitution, that venerable document, speaks plainly on this matter, its words a testament to the founders' genius and foresight. And yet, in a seeming disregard for the written word, the proponents of this amendment would seek to impose their will, to impose their narrow vision on a nation founded on the principles of liberty and tolerance. The very notion is anathema to the spirit of American democracy, a spirit that prizes freedom above all else.\n\nIn the councils of power, a subtle but insidious force is at work, one that would reduce the rich tapestry of faith to a monolith of state-defined orthodoxy. The irony is not lost on those who would see this amendment as a thinly veiled attempt to privilege one creed over all others. And so they rail against the very idea, seeing in it a testament to the creeping influence of theocracy.\n\nThe economy, that great engine of progress, would be little affected, yet the proposed amendment would have far-reaching consequences, insidiously chipping away at the bedrock of American freedom. The societal impact, too, would be profound, as the very fabric of our national identity would be reshaped by the imposition of a state-defined dogma.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the state to dictate the terms of the divine, nor is it for the government to impose its will on the faithful. The churches, those venerable institutions of faith, must be free to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. For in the words of the constitution, the distinction between church and state is not a suggestion, but a fundamental imperative, a bulwark against the tyranny of the majority and the oppression of the minority.\n\nIn this, the proposed amendment would be a calamity, a betrayal of the trust that has been placed in us as citizens. We must stand against this thinly veiled attempt to subvert the constitution, to undermine the very foundations of our democracy. For in the words of the great American jurist, the constitution is not a document to be tinkered with, but a sacred trust, a beacon of hope in a world beset by darkness and despair.\n\nUltimately, it is not for the federal government, nor any government, to dictate the terms of faith. It is for the churches, those institutions of faith, to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. And so we must resist this amendment, this thinly veiled attempt to impose a state-defined dogma on a nation founded on the principles of liberty and tolerance. For in the end, it is not the state that should dictate the terms of the divine, but the faithful, free to worship as they see fit, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the government.",
            "The scar of war remains in the memory like a festering wound, a constant reminder of the deceit that festered in the heart of our nation. The invasion of Iraq, a calamitous event born of half-truths and misinformation, left an indelible stain on the conscience of our country. The government's motivations, shrouded in a veil of secrecy, were as opaque as the darkness that descended upon the land.\n\nLike a rot that had set deep within the bone, the reasons for war were infected with the germ of dishonesty. The government's attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the atrocities of 9/11, a connection as tenuous as the threads of a spider's web, was a palpable lie. Yet, it was a lie that resonated deeply with the American people, their emotions manipulated by the government's skilled artisans of propaganda. The echoes of that deceit still linger, a testament to the ease with which we can be led astray by the whispers of those in power.\n\nAs I reflect on the war in Iraq, I am reminded of the terrible toll it took on our nation. The countless lives lost, the families shattered, the futures forever altered. A war that seemed to promise a swift and easy victory, but instead became a quagmire of blood and chaos, a lesson we failed to learn from the mistakes of Vietnam. The government, blinded by its own hubris, failed to grasp the complexity of the situation, and the people paid the price.\n\nThe void left by the removal of Saddam's regime was a chasm as vast as the one that yawns between the promise and the reality of democracy. The government, like a ship without anchor, was swept up in the currents of its own ambition, failing to chart a course that would lead to a stable and peaceful outcome. The aftermath of the invasion was a maelstrom of violence and chaos, as the country was left to pick up the pieces of a shattered society.\n\nAs I grapple with the weight of these events, I am reminded of the words of my own father, who once spoke of the importance of planning for all possible outcomes. But in the rush to war, the government was woefully unprepared for the consequences of its actions. The loss of life, the destruction of infrastructure, the displacement of people – all of these were consequences that could have been foreseen, but were willfully ignored.\n\nThe war in Iraq serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of accountability. It is a cautionary tale of the devastating consequences of a government that prioritizes its own interests above the welfare of its people. As I look back on the events that transpired, I am left with a sense of sadness and regret, a feeling that we were complicit in our own downfall.\n\nThe question of whether we should have gone to war remains a difficult one, a Gordian knot that twists and turns in the mind. But one thing is certain – the war in Iraq was a catastrophic mistake, a tragedy that will haunt us for generations to come. As we move forward, we must learn from our mistakes and strive to create a world where the rule of law and the principles of justice are upheld. Anything less would be a betrayal of the very ideals that we claim to represent.\n\nThe scars of war will take a long time to heal, but it is in the darkness that we find the true measure of our character. It is in the willingness to confront the truth, to acknowledge our mistakes, and to strive for a better future. As we move forward, let us remember the lessons of Iraq, and may we emerge from the ashes of our hubris, wiser and more compassionate, our hearts heavy with the knowledge of what we have lost, and our spirits renewed by the promise of a brighter tomorrow.",
            "The air was heavy with the weight of what could not be said. He hesitated, the words caught in his throat like a choking ember. Gay marriage. A flame that flickered in the depths of his being, a fire that had long since burned away the shadows of doubt. It was a thing of the heart, not the mind, a whispered promise in the dark. He thought of the couples in his neighborhood, their love a beacon in the desolate landscape of his world. They walked the streets, their dogs by their side, just as any other family would. But to be recognized, to be acknowledged, was to invite the darkness of judgment.\n\nHe spoke of the biological, the chemical whispers in the brain, the predisposition that could not be changed. It was a thing of science, not society, a truth that stood apart from the fallible words of men. He thought of his own childhood, the absence of a father, the presence of sisters, and wondered if it made him any less a man. The sociological, the cultural, the expectations of a world that would not understand. It was all a web of deceit, a spider's snare that sought to entangle and ensnare.\n\nMarriage, a sacred bond, a union of two souls, was it not a thing of the heart, not the law? He thought of the couples who fled to Vegas, their love a secret, a stolen moment in the desert. But for those who loved in the shadows, in the silence, who spoke of love as a right, not a privilege. He thought of the newspapers, the headlines, the scrutinizing eyes of a world that would not be swayed. It was a thing of the public domain, of the federal, of the laws that bound and gagged the heart.\n\nHe shook his head, a slow, deliberate motion, as if to clear the cobwebs from his mind. The words, the arguments, the rationalizations, they were all mere smoke, a mist that obscured the truth. He thought of the couples, the love that shone like a beacon in the darkness, and knew that it was not for him to decide. It was for them to choose, to love, to live, to be.\n\nHis voice, a low, measured tone, cut through the air like a knife. I am for gay marriage. It is a thing of the heart, a flame that burns bright and true, a love that knows no bounds. It is a personal preference, a choice, a decision that should be left to those who love, not to the whims of men who would seek to dictate the terms of the heart.",
            "The thin veil of the digital realm, once thought to be a sanctuary, now hangs heavy with the weight of consequence. When words are set loose upon the winds of the internet, they are like autumn leaves, scattered and impossible to contain. The public forum, a landscape once traversed by the whispers of friends and acquaintances, has become a thoroughfare for the reckless and the malicious.\n\nAs an RA, I have witnessed the catastrophic aftermath of thoughtless utterances, the shards of shattered reputations that litter the digital terrain like the splintered remnants of a shattered glass. The ephemeral nature of online discourse belies its far-reaching consequences, for once released, words cannot be recalled. They seep into the consciousness of others, indelibly staining their perceptions.\n\nThe incident at our school serves as a stark illustration of this phenomenon. A careless remark, meant as a jest, was overheard and reported, setting in motion a chain of events that culminated in a thorough investigation. The ease with which one's digital footprint can be accessed, the lack of boundaries between the private and public spheres, is a stark reminder of the perils of online expression.\n\nIn this vast, uncharted expanse, the lines between jest and earnest are frequently blurred. The internet, a reflection of humanity's darker impulses, can amplify the most base and hurtful sentiments, rendering them audible to all. It is a realm where the distinction between intention and consequence is lost, where the ephemeral nature of words is exploited by the malicious.\n\nThe inherent lack of control, the vulnerability to the whims of others, is a reality that must be acknowledged. While school officials may not be entitled to monitor the online activities of their students, the moment a threat or concern is brought to their attention, they are duty-bound to act. It is a delicate balance, one that requires a nuanced understanding of the digital landscape and its far-reaching implications.\n\nIn this context, the creation of online personas, the friending of students, and the monitoring of their online activities are all fraught with peril. The blurring of boundaries, the invasion of privacy, can have far-reaching consequences, both for the individual and the community. It is a minefield that requires great care and sensitivity to navigate.\n\nUltimately, the internet, a double-edged sword, holds the power to both unite and divide. As we traverse this uncharted territory, we must proceed with caution, mindful of the words we choose to utter, the lines we cross, and the consequences that follow. For in the digital realm, the past and present are inextricably linked, and the shadows of our online actions can haunt us for eternity.",
            "The war, a drawn-out thing, a slow unraveling of purpose. What once was a beacon of hope, a shining light to guide us towards democracy, has lost its way. The shadow of the original intent lingers, a fleeting memory of a reason that once burned bright. Now it's a meandering path, a purpose lost in the haze of time.\n\nIn the beginning, the desire to restore democracy in another land was a noble pursuit. A crusade to free the oppressed, to give voice to those silenced by tyranny. But like a statue worn by the elements, the motive has eroded, gradually losing its shape and definition. It's become a monotonous drone, a justification for the sake of justification. A war of attrition, where the only victory is the mere act of continued existence.\n\nThe threads of our original purpose have frayed, tangled in the complexities of history. The recollections of George Bush's predecessor and Saddam Hussein's past grievances have become a tangled skein, a noose that chokes the air from our lungs. If our aim was to plant the seeds of democracy, perhaps it was not an unworthy endeavor. But when personal vendettas bleed into the equation, the endeavor becomes tainted, a poison that seeps into the very fabric of our intentions.\n\nWe've made our statement, a resounding declaration that will echo through the annals of time. But the cacophony of war has continued, a prolonged dirge that grows louder with each passing day. We've lost sight of the objective, succumbed to the siren song of war, an endless and mindless dance. The costs mount, a staggering tally of lives, a hemorrhage of our economy, a bleeding wound that refuses to clot.\n\nAnd for what? To prove our power? To assert our dominance? The nations we've been fighting to \"liberate\" have grown weary, their governments learning to fend for themselves, while our own coffers are drained, our people suffering, and our future uncertain. We've forgotten the people we set out to help, their struggles, their hopes, their dreams. We've become entangled in the quagmire of war, our own priorities lost in the mire.\n\nWe pour billions into a conflict that has long since lost its purpose, while our own cities beg for attention, our people cry out for aid. The war has become a cancer, a festering wound that refuses to heal. We've lost sight of our own priorities, our own needs, our own humanity. It's time to cut the umbilical cord, to sever the ties that bind us to this conflict. It's time to bring our soldiers home, to tend to our own wounds, to find a new path forward, a path that leads us towards a brighter future, a future where our economy thrives, our people prosper, and our hearts are not weighed down by the burden of war.",
            "In a world where the boundaries of surveillance are as indistinct as the horizon, the notion of privacy has grown tenuous.  The vast expanse of the internet, like an unforgiving desert, stretches out before us, inviting the unwary traveler to leave their footprints for all to see. Myspace, a digital agora, beckons with its promise of connection and community, yet its allure is treacherous, for in its depths, the prying eyes of strangers lurk, waiting to strike.\n\nConsider this: when we surrender our information to the void of cyberspace, we tacitly consent to its dissemination.  A friend request, a click, a keystroke – all these can be the keys that unlock a Pandora's box of scrutiny.  The notion that we can control who sees what is a myth, a chimera born of our own hubris.  The internet, a vast and insatiable creature, devours our secrets and spits them back out, unrecognizable, to the world.\n\nBut what of the individual who stumbles upon our digital trail?  Is it the voyeur, the stalker, or the guardian angel who intervenes to prevent a catastrophe?  Or is it merely the happenstance of the digital age, where information flows like a river, unregulated and unfettered?  The line between these dichotomies blurs, leaving us to navigate the treacherous shoals of the digital world, ever vigilant, yet ever vulnerable.\n\nI recall a television program I once watched, a cautionary tale of a man who reveled in his ability to uncover the hidden truths of the internet.  He stalked a young girl, gathering her digital breadcrumbs, until he had ensnared her in his web of deceit.  I shuddered at the ease with which he had accomplished this feat, the speed at which he had insinuated himself into her world.  It was a sobering reminder of the perils that lurk in the digital shadows, waiting to pounce upon the unsuspecting.\n\nAnd yet, we cannot help but be drawn to this digital promised land, this frontier of connection and community.  We crave the intimacy of online relationships, the ease of communication, the promise of connection.  But we must be aware of the risks, the potential consequences of our actions in this unforgiving world.  We must be mindful of the information we share, the doors we open, the windows we leave unlatched.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance we must strike, a precarious tightrope walk between the benefits and the dangers of the digital age.  We must be aware, yet not paranoid; connected, yet cautious.  For in this vast and often unforgiving expanse, our digital footprints can lead us down a path from which we may never return.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the world's collective judgment, the Iraq War stands as a barren and lifeless thing, a monument to the futility of human endeavor. It's a truth we'd rather not confront, yet one that's palpable in the air, a stench that clings to us like the ash of a long-dead fire. To speak of it now feels like a betrayal, a joining of the chorus of voices that bemoan its folly, a bandwagon we'd rather not be a part of.\n\nAnd yet, it's a truth that's inescapable. The polls, a litany of consensus, echo through the wasteland like the whispers of the dead. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, Iraqi and foreign alike, view it as a calamity, a debacle born of hubris and ignorance. Even the troops, the soldiers who toil in the quagmire, share this assessment, their voices a muted whisper in the darkness, a reluctant admission of the futility of their endeavor.\n\nIt's a disaster, a catastrophe that unfolded long before the ink was dry on the invasion plans. A disaster that's been perpetuated by the very people who promised to bring order to the chaos, to impose their brand of democracy on a culture that rejects it. The chasm between the West and the Middle East yawns wide, a gulf that's too great to bridge, a gulf that's been exacerbated by the very actions of those who sought to bridge it.\n\nWe're not the arbiters of another people's fate, nor should we pretend to be. Saddam was a monster, a tyrant who brought suffering to his own people. But to weigh the pros and cons, to balance the scales of justice, requires a wisdom we've yet to demonstrate. The cons, like quicksand, have sucked us in, ensnared us in a morass from which there's no easy escape.\n\nThe reasons for staying are thin, a threadbare excuse for a policy that's lost all coherence. The administration's hopeful ideas, like mirages on the horizon, vanish upon closer inspection. The problems of withdrawal, they say, are too great to contemplate. But I see no reason to stay, no reason to perpetuate a cycle of violence and suffering.\n\nAnd so we're left with the words of the Iraqis themselves, the people we claim to be saving, the people who tell us to leave. Eighty percent of them, a majority, demand our departure within the year. A quarter, a vocal minority, urge us to leave now. It's a message we'd do well to heed, a message that says we're not the saviors we claim to be, that we're not the solution to their problems.\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, not as long as we're imposing our will on theirs. But if we listen to their voices, if we heed their words, perhaps we can begin to crawl out of this abyss, to find a path that's not strewn with the ashes of our failed endeavors. Perhaps, just perhaps, we can find a way to leave with some semblance of dignity, to extricate ourselves from this quagmire and begin anew.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a society worn down by the relentless march of time, the specter of inequality persists. It is a ghost that haunts the corridors of progress, a specter that refuses to be vanquished by the cold light of day. The issue of gender discrimination, in particular, remains a festering wound, a reminder of the deep-seated prejudices that still linger in the recesses of our collective consciousness.\n\nIt is not a problem unique to women, for men also struggle beneath the weight of societal expectations. The glass ceiling, that impenetrable barrier that bars women from the highest echelons of power, is matched by a less visible but no less insidious bias that can afflict men in certain industries. The fashion world, for instance, is often characterized by a narrow and exclusive aesthetic, one that valorizes certain styles of life and dismisses others as superficial or frivolous.\n\nIn the rarefied realm of high society, men who dare to venture into the world of fashion are often met with suspicion and disdain. Their masculinity is called into question, their motivations seen as suspect. They are viewed as outsiders, as if their participation in this realm is somehow less authentic than that of their female counterparts. It is a pernicious form of prejudice, one that is rooted in a deep-seated discomfort with the notion of men expressing themselves through fashion.\n\nAnd yet, as we navigate this treacherous landscape, we must also acknowledge the ways in which societal norms can work to exclude those from certain backgrounds or with certain abilities. A man from a rural background, with a strong work ethic and a keen intellect, may find himself at a disadvantage when competing for positions of power. His grammar may not be polished, his accent may be rough, and yet he may possess a wisdom and a depth of character that are overlooked in favor of more polished, more refined candidates.\n\nSo too, women who choose to stay at home and raise their children may be met with scorn and derision, their choices seen as somehow less valid than those of their counterparts in the workforce. And yet, as the world changes, as we slowly but inexorably move towards a more enlightened understanding of what it means to be human, we must recognize that these biases are not inherent, but rather a product of a particular set of cultural and historical circumstances.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we must work to promote understanding and empathy, to challenge the status quo and to create a more inclusive, more compassionate society. It is a slow and difficult process, one that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to listen to and learn from those who may hold different perspectives. But as we strive towards this goal, we must remember that change is possible, that even the most entrenched biases can be overcome with time, effort, and a willingness to see the world in a different light.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of whether we can overcome these biases, but rather when. For in a world that is increasingly global, increasingly interconnected, we have no choice but to recognize the inherent value and worth of every individual, regardless of their background, their abilities, or their choices. We must see the world in all its complexity, in all its messiness, and strive to create a society that is truly just, truly equitable, and truly reflective of the diversity that makes us human.",
            "In a land where laws lay like the ashes of a burned world, the notion of what was once a transgression had been reduced to naught but a citation, a mere ticket to be paid and forgotten. The legalization of a certain substance, a plant once shunned and reviled, had brought forth a new era of tolerance, or perhaps merely a shrugging of the shoulders. The city of Denver, where the winds of progress howled like a mournful sigh, had taken the first step, a hesitant giant lumbering forth into the light.\n\nThe cost of arresting, booking, and housing those who partook in this once-forbidden pastime had been a weighty burden, a millstone around the neck of the municipal coffers. But now, with the weight lifted, the city's purse was free to attend to more pressing matters: the education of its youth, the care of its elderly, and the feeding of its hungry. A windfall, some would say, but others would caution that the devil was in the details.\n\nFor in a world where the boundaries between right and wrong had grown hazy, the specter of a substance-fueled society loomed large. The streets, once a battleground of competing interests, now teetered on the edge of a new reality, one where the line between indulgence and debasement was blurred. The taboo, that unseen hand that guided the masses, seemed to falter, its grip weakening with each passing day.\n\nSome would argue that the effects of this substance, while perhaps not as debilitating as those of its more potent cousin, held its own set of perils. The lifestyle it fostered, a world of lounging and lethargy, was a far cry from the dynamism that had once driven humanity forward. And yet, others would counter that each individual was unique, a snowflake in a world of chaos, and that the effects of this substance, like those of any other, were as varied as the stars in the night sky.\n\nIn the end, it was a matter of perspective, a matter of weighing the pros and cons, of considering the world as it was, and the world as it might be. For in a land where the winds of change howled through the streets, the only constant was uncertainty, and the only truth was that nothing was as it seemed.\n\nIn this world, where the language of morality was constantly in flux, the question remained: what was the true cost of progress? Was it the freedom to indulge, or the freedom to choose? Only time would tell, as the city of Denver, like a ship sailing into the unknown, charted its course through the uncharted waters of a new era.",
            "The truth is, I'd say yes. Because in the end, it's the beauty of tradition that endures. Like the rituals we cling to, day in and day out. The comfort of familiar patterns, worn smooth by the passage of time. It's a thing to be cherished, a bulwark against the void. But, like the shifting sands of the desert, we must adapt, must yield to the forces of change. The Catholic Church, with its doctrine and dogma, is a behemoth of tradition, a monolith that stands steadfast against the currents of the world. Yet, in its strict adherence to the past, it often forgets the very principles it holds dear. The love of others, a tenet of the faith, is oft subverted by the intolerance that masquerades as orthodoxy. It's a disease that infects the body of the Church, a cancer that eats away at its very soul.\n\nThe hypocrisy is palpable, a stench that clings to the fabric of the institution like a shroud. We are taught to love, yet we are not taught to accept. We are taught to follow the dogma, no matter the cost. It's a relic of a bygone era, a fossilized remnant of a time long past. And yet, the Church clings to it, a stubborn, blind creature driven by a will to survive, rather than a desire to evolve.\n\nAs for the issue of priests marrying, I'm not convinced it's the solution to the problem of pedophilia. Those who would prey on the innocent do so out of a diseased heart, not a lack of a spouse. Marriage or no marriage, they would still act, driven by their twisted desires. It's a sickness that cannot be cured by a simple change in circumstances. But, I suppose, it's a step in the right direction, a nod to the reality of human nature. After all, we are creatures of flesh and blood, subject to the frailties and weaknesses that beset us all.\n\nIn the end, it's not the institution that matters, but the individuals who comprise it. And it's the individuals who must be held accountable for their actions, not the rituals and dogma that surround them. The Church may be a vessel, but it's the people who fill it, who give it life, who make it holy. And it's the people who must be judged, not the structures that they inhabit.",
            "The mire of this issue thickens, a Gordian knot of conflicting sentiments. To address it, one must navigate the thin line between the sacred and the secular, the state and the church. Marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil union to others. Yet, is it not the latter, a bond between two individuals, that should be recognized by the government? The lines blur, and I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this debate. If marriage is a sacrament, then perhaps it should be left to the churches to define, lest the government meddles in the affairs of the divine. But if it is a civil union, then why not extend the same rights, the same privileges, to all who enter into such a bond, regardless of the manner in which they are joined?\n\nI do not pretend to have an answer, nor do I propose a solution. The issue seems too complex, too fraught with the potential for hurt and division. Yet, if we are to address it, we must do so with care and sensitivity. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? It seems a heavy-handed approach, one that disregards the nuance and complexity of this issue. The Constitution should not be amended for the whims of a minority, no matter how passionate their cause.\n\nAnd so, I stand at a remove, uncertain and unclear. The debate rages on, a maelstrom of opinion and emotion. I can only hope that, in the end, reason and compassion will prevail.",
            "In the shadow of my upbringing, a Christian home, I have come to regard the issue of homosexuality as a labyrinth of ambiguity. The lines that once seemed so clear have grown indistinct, like the outlines of a landscape shrouded in mist. My friendships with individuals who identify as gay have only served to muddle the waters further. I am torn between the certainties of my upbringing and the complexities of the world around me.\n\nThe question of legalization hangs in the balance, a pendulum swinging between the poles of acceptance and rejection. I do not subscribe to the notion that it should be a national issue, a matter for the president to dictate. Each state, with its unique character and values, should be free to chart its own course. The democratic states, with their liberal leanings, will likely champion the cause, while the more conservative states will resist. In such a scenario, it is the individual who chooses to reside in a given state who must abide by its laws and customs. I propose that we grant homosexuals the same rights and opportunities as their heterosexual counterparts, leaving the decision to legalize same-sex marriage to the discretion of each state.\n\nThe notion that the president should impose his will on the entire nation is a notion I find troubling. George Bush, for instance, has seen fit to ban gay marriage, but his authority extends only to the office he occupies. He does not reside in every state, and it is the people of each state who should decide how they wish to govern themselves. The president's tenure is fleeting, and with the passage of time, the pendulum will swing once more. It is the states, with their distinctive cultures and values, that must bear the weight of this decision, not the president.\n\nI do not condone the notion that the president should impose his will on the nation. In the end, it is the individual states that must live with the consequences of their decisions. I do not believe it is for the president to dictate how each state should govern itself.",
            "The notion of privacy in a world where the very fabric of the internet hangs like a gossamer thread for all to see is a tenuous thing. A public platform like Myspace, where one's thoughts and words are laid bare for the world to scrutinize, invites the gaze of others. The school officials, with their desire to safeguard the students, might see it as a necessary intrusion, a means to prevent the very horrors that have befallen places like Columbine. But does this not tread a fine line between protection and invasion?\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between public and private have grown increasingly blurred, it is a question of what we mean by 'public'. Is it not true that anything placed upon the internet is, in effect, a public declaration? And does this not give those who govern the right to intervene, to prevent the spread of ideas that might lead to harm? The notion that the internet is a sanctuary of sorts, a place where one can freely express oneself without consequence, is a myth. The digital trail we leave behind is a testament to our every thought, our every action.\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher of mine, a discussion about the measures taken to ensure the safety of the students. The lockdown drills, the protocols in place for instances of violence. It was a means to prepare for the worst, to prevent the unthinkable. And is this not what the school officials were attempting to do in this case? To prevent a tragedy, to safeguard the students? The line between invasion and protection is thin, and it is a line that we must continually reassess in this brave new world of ours.\n\nThe ease with which we can express ourselves online is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows us to convey our thoughts and feelings to a vast audience. On the other, it leaves us vulnerable to the prying eyes of others. We are our own worst enemies in this regard, our fears and doubts laid bare for all to see. And once something is posted online, it is there forever, a digital scar that cannot be erased.\n\nIt is a delicate balance we must strike, one that requires us to weigh the importance of freedom of expression against the need for protection. And it is a balance that will continue to shift, as the world around us evolves and adapts. But in the end, it is a question of what we value most: our right to express ourselves, or our right to be safe.",
            "In the blackened expanse of a mind still reeling from the aftershocks of a distant atrocity, the disquieting echoes of nine-eleven lingered like a miasma. A wound that refused to close, it festering and festering until it became an open sore that wept with every passing day. In its wake, a tide of emotion swept across the nation, a maelstrom of anger and fear that threatened to consume all in its path. And in the midst of this tempest, a decision was made to intervene, to insert ourselves into the crucible of a foreign land, to remake it in our own image. But the hubris of this endeavor was a siren's call, luring us into the treacherous waters of a conflict that would prove to be a quagmire, a quicksand that sucked in the unwary and spat out the broken.\n\nAt first, the zeal to act was a palpable thing, a fire that burned bright and hot, consuming all in its path. But as the embers of that initial fervor cooled, the outlines of a more nuanced reality began to emerge. The people we sought to save were not so easily saved, their struggles and triumphs a far cry from our own. War, for them, was a different beast, a savagery that knew no quarter, a endless cycle of violence and retaliation. And we, with our idealism and our hubris, had stumbled into this maelstrom unprepared, our plans a ragged and tattered thing, our motivations a mix of revenge and benevolence.\n\nIn the end, it was this lack of preparation, this failure to grasp the intricacies of a foreign land and its people, that would prove to be our undoing. We had gone in with a sense of superiority, of a civilizing force, but what we found was a complex tapestry of hatreds and resentments, a skein of rivalries and vendettas that we could not untangle. And so we became embroiled, our presence a constant thorn in the side of the very people we sought to help, our efforts to impose order and stability thwarted at every turn.\n\nNow, looking back, it is clear that we were mistaken, that our intervention was a folly, a well-intentioned but catastrophic mistake. We had thought to remake the world in our image, but what we created was a mess, a chaos of conflicting interests and unbridgeable divides. And so we must now extricate ourselves, withdraw from this quagmire, and let the people of that land find their own way. For we are not the ones to change them, to impose our will upon them. They are a people with their own history, their own culture, and their own destiny. And it is time for us to acknowledge this, to recognize the limits of our power, and to withdraw, humbled and chastened, from this foreign soil.\n\nBut the memories of that fateful day linger, a ghostly presence that haunts our collective psyche, a reminder of the perils of hubris and the dangers of intervention. And so we must learn from this, must recognize the limits of our power, and must strive to be more mindful in our actions, to think more carefully before we act, to consider the long-term consequences of our decisions. For in the end, it is not the mighty who shall inherit the earth, but the wise, the cautious, and the humble."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the depths of a world where shadows of doubt crept in, where the once unshakeable foundations of the Catholic Church wavered, a whispered question arose. Do they cling to the familiar, or do they surrender to the tides of change? The institution, once a bastion of tradition, now teetered on the precipice, its grip on the faithful beginning to loosen. The winds of time howled through its halls, casting aspersions on the Church's rigid stance on matters of the heart.\n\nLike a withered leaf, the Church's views on certain issues – the sanctity of life, the bonds of love, the sacraments of birth and death – seemed to cling tenuously to the branches of time, yellowed and brittle. The world outside moved forward, its pace quickening with each passing day, while the Church's stance remained frozen, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIt was said that the faithful were deserting, their numbers dwindling as the Church's rigidity only served to drive them further away. The din of dissent grew louder, a cacophony of voices that echoed through the desolate landscape of a world in flux. The Church's stance on matters of the heart seemed to be an anachronism, a stubborn refusal to bend in the face of changing times.\n\nOne could not help but wonder, in a world where love and compassion were the guiding principles, why the Church clung so tenaciously to its dogma. Why, in a world where the bonds of family and community were stretched taut, did the Church insist on its doctrine of celibacy? The question hung in the air, a challenge to the very fabric of the institution.\n\nThe winds of change howled on, a maelstrom that threatened to consume the Church whole. And yet, in the midst of the turmoil, a glimmer of hope flickered, a whispered promise that the Church might yet find a way to adapt, to bend without breaking. For in a world where love and acceptance were the keys to salvation, perhaps the Church's greatest challenge lay not in resisting the tides of change, but in embracing them.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, where the very foundations of the Church trembled, a question echoed through the void: could the Catholic Church find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the demands of a new world? Or would it succumb to the weight of its own rigidity, lost in a sea of time? Only the future held the answer, a future that hung precariously in the balance, like a leaf on the winds of change.",
            "The world is not a canvas for our petty judgments. It is a tapestry of complexities, woven from threads of fate and circumstance. And yet, we find ourselves drawn into the vortex of moral absolutes, our minds grasping for certainties in a sea of uncertainty. I, like many, have found myself adrift in this maelstrom, struggling to find footing on the shifting sands of opinion. The question of gay marriage, a topic that has gained prominence in these tumultuous times, has been a source of consternation for me.\n\nAs I ponder the issue, I am reminded of the fundamental truth that we are not born as blank slates, waiting to be inscribed with the characters of our destiny. Our very existence is a tapestry of choices and circumstances, yet there are some things that lie beyond our control. The same goes for the question of sexual orientation. It is a mystery, a labyrinth that we navigate without the benefit of a map or compass. We are not born with the choices of our lives already made, but with the capacity to forge our own path.\n\nThe notion that a person's sexual orientation is a choice, a conscious decision to defy societal norms, strikes me as a fallacy. It is a sentiment that reeks of a narrow-mindedness that seeks to impose its will on the complexities of human nature. Gay people, like all of us, are not aberrations, but rather an integral part of the human experience.\n\nTo deny them the right to marriage, to love, and to live their lives as they see fit, is to perpetuate a false narrative that we are the sole arbiters of what is right and wrong. It is a hubris that forgets that our understanding of the world is but a mere fraction of the grand tapestry. We are not the authors of the script, but merely characters in a story that is being written by forces beyond our comprehension.\n\nThe federal government, in its attempts to regulate the private lives of its citizens, oversteps its bounds. It is not our duty to impose our moral vision on others, but rather to create a society that allows individuals to live their lives as they see fit, so long as they do not harm others. It is a delicate balance, one that requires us to be mindful of our own limitations and the infinite complexities of human nature.\n\nIn the end, it is not for us to judge, but to allow. To create a world where love knows no bounds, where people can be themselves without fear of persecution or marginalization. It is a world that is not yet realized, but one that we must strive for, lest we forget the simple truth that we are all human, bound together by our shared experiences and our capacity for compassion.",
            "In the desolate expanse of this cold and forsaken land, where the tree of reason seems to wither and die, there remains a beacon of hope - the hope for equality, for the unwavering pursuit of justice, and for the unrelenting quest for truth. The issue of gay marriage is a matter of stark simplicity, a binary choice between the light of acceptance and the dark of prejudice. And yet, the fervent opposition to it is a palpable force, a maelstrom of fear and misunderstanding that threatens to consume us all.\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the institution of heterosexual marriage is a canard, a feeble excuse for the intolerance that festers in the hearts of those who cling to the status quo. The truth is, the essence of marriage is not bound by the shackles of biology, but by the indomitable spirit of love and commitment. Two individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, can form a bond that is just as strong, just as deep, and just as worthy of recognition as any other.\n\nThe defense of civil rights is not a partisan issue, nor is it a matter of personal opinion. It is a fundamental human right, a cornerstone of our democracy, and a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of compassion. The struggles of gay couples are not unlike those of any other couple - they face the same trials, the same tribulations, and the same triumphs. And it is precisely this shared humanity that we must acknowledge and celebrate, rather than deny and exclude.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a sacrosanct principle, one that has been enshrined in our Constitution. To allow the government to codify the tenets of a particular faith, be it Christianity or any other, is to invite the kind of hypocrisy that has ravaged our society for far too long. The phrase \"separate but equal\" has been used to justify the most heinous of injustices, and it is our duty to reject its pernicious influence once and for all.\n\nThe fear of the unknown, the fear of change, and the fear of difference are powerful engines of intolerance. They fuel the fires of prejudice, and they fuel the flames of hatred. But they are also the very things that we must confront, that we must overcome, and that we must vanquish if we are to create a society that is just, equitable, and fair for all.\n\nThe scientific community has spoken, and it is clear that homosexual relationships are not inherently defective, nor are they a product of childhood trauma or personal pathology. The American Psychological Association has weighed in, and its findings are unequivocal - the notion that gay people are somehow flawed or inferior is a myth, a lie, and a calumny.\n\nIn the end, it is not about politics, or ideology, or even morality. It is about humanity. It is about our capacity for compassion, our ability to empathize, and our willingness to see the world through the eyes of another. It is about recognizing that we are not so different, that we are all part of a shared human experience, and that our differences are what make us strong, not weak.\n\nSo let us not be swayed by the siren song of fear, of intolerance, and of ignorance. Let us not be deterred by the opposition of those who would seek to deny us our basic human rights. Let us stand tall, let us stand proud, and let us demand that our voices be heard. For in the end, it is not just about gay marriage - it is about the very fabric of our society, and the kind of world we want to create for ourselves and for future generations.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital, a summer's toil, I find myself entwined with the shadows of the pharmacy. The shadows cast by the fluorescent lights, a cold and unforgiving glow that seeps into the very marrow of one's bones. It is here, amidst the sterile counters and the rows of bottles, that I find myself grappling with the complexities of a world in flux. The question that hangs in the air, like a specter, is one of morality and the role of the forbidden. \n\nJust because a substance is proscribed, does it not possess some hidden virtue? Does its utility in the realm of medicine not outweigh the taboos that surround it? I think of the oxycodone and the Vicodin, the Percocet, used by my colleagues with frequency and with purpose. These are drugs, I am told, that hold no place in the world of the uninhibited. Yet, in the world of the hospital, they are nothing short of essential. The distinction, it seems to me, is a curious one.\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is a tired one. We all know the perils of excess, the ruin that can be wrought by overindulgence. But the similarities between the two substances are limited. The danger lies, I think, not in the substance itself, but in the manner of its use. Remove the stigma, the shroud of prohibition, and perhaps, just perhaps, we may find a more responsible path.\n\nThe image of marijuana, a caricature of a substance, held in the public eye, is one of degradation and decay. It is a picture of a world gone mad, of lives ruined by the very thing that might have brought solace. But is this image not a distortion? Is it not a product of our own fears and our own biases? I think of the heroin and the cocaine, the true scourges of our time. The comparison to marijuana is a false one, a convenient smokescreen designed to obscure the truth.\n\nIn the end, it is not the substance itself that is the problem, but our own perceptions, our own fears. Remove the taboos, the shrouds of prohibition, and perhaps, just perhaps, we may find a new path, a path of responsibility and of reason.",
            "The church has undergone a metamorphosis, its staid traditions yielding to the demands of the twenty-first century. The once rigid facade now appears more relaxed, a facade worn down by the gentle lapping of time. As a child, I was accustomed to Sundays spent within its hallowed halls, my attire a pristine, cookie-cutter reflection of the expectations that governed my early years. Matching dresses, shoes, and purses – a uniform that signified not only my belonging but also my devotion. Those were simpler times, ones that waned as I grew older.\n\nAt my private school, I would catch glimpses of my friends on weekends, all of us hurrying to and fro, our footsteps echoing within the church's hallowed walls. But as the years passed, the church adapted, its rituals condensed to thirty minutes, a hurried sacrifice to the pace of modern life. Summer mornings saw families arrive in beach attire, the very emblem of a world in disarray. Even morning masses, once a bastion of propriety, now welcomed the casual, the jeans and khakis a testament to a more relaxed era.\n\nAs I reflect on my experiences, I am struck by the changing times, the church a reflection of the world at large. I do not pretend to understand the inner workings of the church's politics, nor do I wish to delve into the complex web of allegations surrounding its clergy. My observations, though limited, suggest that the church's strictures did little to prevent the scourge of pedophilia.\n\nThe notion that allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference is a notion I find difficult to accept. Pedophilia, I believe, is a product of an individual's nature, a predisposition that cannot be altered by the trappings of marriage or the blessings of the church. Even in faiths that permit marriage among their clergy, the aberrant individual will still find a way to indulge their baser desires. It is a choice, a choice made by the individual, not by the institution.\n\nIn the end, it seems to me that the church's inability to prevent these atrocities lies not in its practices but in the human condition. We are what we are, our inclinations shaped by forces beyond our control, genetics a primary driver of our nature. The church, in its attempts to police the desires of its clergy, may have been misguided, but it was not the root cause of this evil.\n\nAs I reflect on the church's place in the world, I am left with more questions than answers. Its role, once a beacon of hope and guidance, now seems a complex, multifaceted entity, one that must confront the darker aspects of human nature.",
            "The ghosts of September's ash still clung to the land like the stench of death on a winter's morning. The memories of that day, like the embers of a long-dead fire, continued to smolder, refusing to be extinguished. The administration's pyre of deceit had been built upon the altar of fear, and the flames of war had consumed the nation. The rhetoric of lies had been woven like a tapestry of deceit, with Saddam Hussein as the thread, Osama Bin Laden as the hook, and the WMDs as the bait.\n\nThe echoes of Colin Powell's hollow words still lingered in the air, a haunted whisper of a man who knew the truth but chose to ignore it. The evidence, like the desert sand, had shifted and slid, revealing the cracks in the administration's facade. The Constitution, that sacred document, had been cast aside like a worn and tattered cloak, trampled by the boots of power.\n\nThe younger Bush, driven by a vendetta born of blood and pride, had set his sights on Baghdad, his eyes fixed on the prize of oil, that black gold that flowed like lifeblood through the veins of the nation. The pretext, a flimsy thing, had been used to justify the slaughter, the terror, the devastation. The world had been fooled, convinced by the sweet whispers of a lie.\n\nAnd now, as the years had passed, the truth had begun to seep through the cracks, like water through the parched earth. The country teetered on the brink of chaos, a fragile thing, balanced precariously between the competing interests of the nations that had come to claim its prize. The Iraqi government, a fragile leaf, was blown by the winds of dissension, its sovereignty threatened by the very powers that had claimed to liberate it.\n\nThe Parliament, a gathering of disparate voices, was a cacophony of discord, a reminder that the Iraqis were not a people to be trifled with. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, was a mere puppet on a string, pulled by the invisible hands of the foreign powers that had brought him to power. The shadow of al-Sadr loomed large, a specter of rebellion, a reminder that the fire of resistance still burned bright.\n\nAnd so, the nation teetered, a delicate balance of power, a house of cards waiting to be blown down. The ghosts of September still lingered, a reminder of the horrors that had been unleashed. The lies, the deceit, the bloodshed – all of it still echoed through the halls of history, a grim reminder of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "I sat in the cold, my words lost in the void. The wind howled through the trees like a mournful cry, a dirge for the lost and the forgotten. I tried to speak, but the words would not come. Just a hollow murmur, a murmur that was swallowed by the silence.\n\nI cleared my throat, and began again. The War in Iraq. A conflict without end, a morass of blood and ash. I felt a sense of futility, a sense that our efforts were as fleeting as the wind that swept through the desolate landscape.\n\nIt was a war without a clear purpose, a war without a declared end. A war born of anger and revenge, of a desire to punish and to dominate. I thought of the children, the sons and daughters lost in the conflict, their lives forever changed by the violence and the bloodshed.\n\nI thought of the terrible weight of responsibility, the burden of power that rested on the shoulders of those who had unleashed this war. The promise of democracy, of freedom and prosperity, had been reduced to a hollow mantra, a justification for the destruction and the chaos that had been wrought.\n\nAnd yet, I was torn. I felt a sense of loyalty to those who had served, who had risked everything to defend a cause that was noble and just. But I also felt a sense of unease, a sense that our presence in Iraq was a cancer, a poison that was eating away at the very fabric of the country.\n\nI thought of the words of my predecessors, the ones who had spoken of the importance of engagement, of the need to build a better world. But I knew that words were cheap, that the cost of war was measured in blood and tears, not in empty rhetoric.\n\nI sighed, my breath misting in the cold air. The War in Iraq was a labyrinth, a maze of conflicting desires and ideologies. I did not know what to say, what to think. All I knew was that I was lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty and doubt.\n\nI paused, collecting my thoughts. Perhaps, I thought, the war was not just about Iraq, but about us. About our own fears and insecurities, our own need for power and control. Perhaps it was a reflection of our own darkness, our own shadow self.\n\nI looked out at the desolate landscape, the wind-whipped trees and the ash-stained rocks. It was a landscape of death and despair, a landscape that seemed to stretch on forever. And I knew that I was just a small part of it, a small part of a larger tapestry that was torn and frayed.\n\nI fell silent, my words lost in the void. The wind howled on, a mournful cry that seemed to echo through the ages.",
            "In the desolate landscape of politics, a canonical question hangs like a specter, shrouded in the murk of constitutional ambiguity. The separation of church and state, that bedrock principle of the American foundational text, stands as a bulwark against the encroachment of ecclesiastical power into the temporal realm. And yet, a proposed amendment seeks to upset this delicate balance, to insinuate the government's hand into the very fabric of faith, a move that would contravene the sacred compact of separation.\n\nThe constitution, that venerable document, speaks plainly on this matter, its words a testament to the founders' genius and foresight. And yet, in a seeming disregard for the written word, the proponents of this amendment would seek to impose their will, to impose their narrow vision on a nation founded on the principles of liberty and tolerance. The very notion is anathema to the spirit of American democracy, a spirit that prizes freedom above all else.\n\nIn the councils of power, a subtle but insidious force is at work, one that would reduce the rich tapestry of faith to a monolith of state-defined orthodoxy. The irony is not lost on those who would see this amendment as a thinly veiled attempt to privilege one creed over all others. And so they rail against the very idea, seeing in it a testament to the creeping influence of theocracy.\n\nThe economy, that great engine of progress, would be little affected, yet the proposed amendment would have far-reaching consequences, insidiously chipping away at the bedrock of American freedom. The societal impact, too, would be profound, as the very fabric of our national identity would be reshaped by the imposition of a state-defined dogma.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the state to dictate the terms of the divine, nor is it for the government to impose its will on the faithful. The churches, those venerable institutions of faith, must be free to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. For in the words of the constitution, the distinction between church and state is not a suggestion, but a fundamental imperative, a bulwark against the tyranny of the majority and the oppression of the minority.\n\nIn this, the proposed amendment would be a calamity, a betrayal of the trust that has been placed in us as citizens. We must stand against this thinly veiled attempt to subvert the constitution, to undermine the very foundations of our democracy. For in the words of the great American jurist, the constitution is not a document to be tinkered with, but a sacred trust, a beacon of hope in a world beset by darkness and despair.\n\nUltimately, it is not for the federal government, nor any government, to dictate the terms of faith. It is for the churches, those institutions of faith, to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. And so we must resist this amendment, this thinly veiled attempt to impose a state-defined dogma on a nation founded on the principles of liberty and tolerance. For in the end, it is not the state that should dictate the terms of the divine, but the faithful, free to worship as they see fit, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the government.",
            "The scar of war remains in the memory like a festering wound, a constant reminder of the deceit that festered in the heart of our nation. The invasion of Iraq, a calamitous event born of half-truths and misinformation, left an indelible stain on the conscience of our country. The government's motivations, shrouded in a veil of secrecy, were as opaque as the darkness that descended upon the land.\n\nLike a rot that had set deep within the bone, the reasons for war were infected with the germ of dishonesty. The government's attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the atrocities of 9/11, a connection as tenuous as the threads of a spider's web, was a palpable lie. Yet, it was a lie that resonated deeply with the American people, their emotions manipulated by the government's skilled artisans of propaganda. The echoes of that deceit still linger, a testament to the ease with which we can be led astray by the whispers of those in power.\n\nAs I reflect on the war in Iraq, I am reminded of the terrible toll it took on our nation. The countless lives lost, the families shattered, the futures forever altered. A war that seemed to promise a swift and easy victory, but instead became a quagmire of blood and chaos, a lesson we failed to learn from the mistakes of Vietnam. The government, blinded by its own hubris, failed to grasp the complexity of the situation, and the people paid the price.\n\nThe void left by the removal of Saddam's regime was a chasm as vast as the one that yawns between the promise and the reality of democracy. The government, like a ship without anchor, was swept up in the currents of its own ambition, failing to chart a course that would lead to a stable and peaceful outcome. The aftermath of the invasion was a maelstrom of violence and chaos, as the country was left to pick up the pieces of a shattered society.\n\nAs I grapple with the weight of these events, I am reminded of the words of my own father, who once spoke of the importance of planning for all possible outcomes. But in the rush to war, the government was woefully unprepared for the consequences of its actions. The loss of life, the destruction of infrastructure, the displacement of people – all of these were consequences that could have been foreseen, but were willfully ignored.\n\nThe war in Iraq serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of accountability. It is a cautionary tale of the devastating consequences of a government that prioritizes its own interests above the welfare of its people. As I look back on the events that transpired, I am left with a sense of sadness and regret, a feeling that we were complicit in our own downfall.\n\nThe question of whether we should have gone to war remains a difficult one, a Gordian knot that twists and turns in the mind. But one thing is certain – the war in Iraq was a catastrophic mistake, a tragedy that will haunt us for generations to come. As we move forward, we must learn from our mistakes and strive to create a world where the rule of law and the principles of justice are upheld. Anything less would be a betrayal of the very ideals that we claim to represent.\n\nThe scars of war will take a long time to heal, but it is in the darkness that we find the true measure of our character. It is in the willingness to confront the truth, to acknowledge our mistakes, and to strive for a better future. As we move forward, let us remember the lessons of Iraq, and may we emerge from the ashes of our hubris, wiser and more compassionate, our hearts heavy with the knowledge of what we have lost, and our spirits renewed by the promise of a brighter tomorrow.",
            "The air was heavy with the weight of what could not be said. He hesitated, the words caught in his throat like a choking ember. Gay marriage. A flame that flickered in the depths of his being, a fire that had long since burned away the shadows of doubt. It was a thing of the heart, not the mind, a whispered promise in the dark. He thought of the couples in his neighborhood, their love a beacon in the desolate landscape of his world. They walked the streets, their dogs by their side, just as any other family would. But to be recognized, to be acknowledged, was to invite the darkness of judgment.\n\nHe spoke of the biological, the chemical whispers in the brain, the predisposition that could not be changed. It was a thing of science, not society, a truth that stood apart from the fallible words of men. He thought of his own childhood, the absence of a father, the presence of sisters, and wondered if it made him any less a man. The sociological, the cultural, the expectations of a world that would not understand. It was all a web of deceit, a spider's snare that sought to entangle and ensnare.\n\nMarriage, a sacred bond, a union of two souls, was it not a thing of the heart, not the law? He thought of the couples who fled to Vegas, their love a secret, a stolen moment in the desert. But for those who loved in the shadows, in the silence, who spoke of love as a right, not a privilege. He thought of the newspapers, the headlines, the scrutinizing eyes of a world that would not be swayed. It was a thing of the public domain, of the federal, of the laws that bound and gagged the heart.\n\nHe shook his head, a slow, deliberate motion, as if to clear the cobwebs from his mind. The words, the arguments, the rationalizations, they were all mere smoke, a mist that obscured the truth. He thought of the couples, the love that shone like a beacon in the darkness, and knew that it was not for him to decide. It was for them to choose, to love, to live, to be.\n\nHis voice, a low, measured tone, cut through the air like a knife. I am for gay marriage. It is a thing of the heart, a flame that burns bright and true, a love that knows no bounds. It is a personal preference, a choice, a decision that should be left to those who love, not to the whims of men who would seek to dictate the terms of the heart.",
            "The thin veil of the digital realm, once thought to be a sanctuary, now hangs heavy with the weight of consequence. When words are set loose upon the winds of the internet, they are like autumn leaves, scattered and impossible to contain. The public forum, a landscape once traversed by the whispers of friends and acquaintances, has become a thoroughfare for the reckless and the malicious.\n\nAs an RA, I have witnessed the catastrophic aftermath of thoughtless utterances, the shards of shattered reputations that litter the digital terrain like the splintered remnants of a shattered glass. The ephemeral nature of online discourse belies its far-reaching consequences, for once released, words cannot be recalled. They seep into the consciousness of others, indelibly staining their perceptions.\n\nThe incident at our school serves as a stark illustration of this phenomenon. A careless remark, meant as a jest, was overheard and reported, setting in motion a chain of events that culminated in a thorough investigation. The ease with which one's digital footprint can be accessed, the lack of boundaries between the private and public spheres, is a stark reminder of the perils of online expression.\n\nIn this vast, uncharted expanse, the lines between jest and earnest are frequently blurred. The internet, a reflection of humanity's darker impulses, can amplify the most base and hurtful sentiments, rendering them audible to all. It is a realm where the distinction between intention and consequence is lost, where the ephemeral nature of words is exploited by the malicious.\n\nThe inherent lack of control, the vulnerability to the whims of others, is a reality that must be acknowledged. While school officials may not be entitled to monitor the online activities of their students, the moment a threat or concern is brought to their attention, they are duty-bound to act. It is a delicate balance, one that requires a nuanced understanding of the digital landscape and its far-reaching implications.\n\nIn this context, the creation of online personas, the friending of students, and the monitoring of their online activities are all fraught with peril. The blurring of boundaries, the invasion of privacy, can have far-reaching consequences, both for the individual and the community. It is a minefield that requires great care and sensitivity to navigate.\n\nUltimately, the internet, a double-edged sword, holds the power to both unite and divide. As we traverse this uncharted territory, we must proceed with caution, mindful of the words we choose to utter, the lines we cross, and the consequences that follow. For in the digital realm, the past and present are inextricably linked, and the shadows of our online actions can haunt us for eternity.",
            "The war, a drawn-out thing, a slow unraveling of purpose. What once was a beacon of hope, a shining light to guide us towards democracy, has lost its way. The shadow of the original intent lingers, a fleeting memory of a reason that once burned bright. Now it's a meandering path, a purpose lost in the haze of time.\n\nIn the beginning, the desire to restore democracy in another land was a noble pursuit. A crusade to free the oppressed, to give voice to those silenced by tyranny. But like a statue worn by the elements, the motive has eroded, gradually losing its shape and definition. It's become a monotonous drone, a justification for the sake of justification. A war of attrition, where the only victory is the mere act of continued existence.\n\nThe threads of our original purpose have frayed, tangled in the complexities of history. The recollections of George Bush's predecessor and Saddam Hussein's past grievances have become a tangled skein, a noose that chokes the air from our lungs. If our aim was to plant the seeds of democracy, perhaps it was not an unworthy endeavor. But when personal vendettas bleed into the equation, the endeavor becomes tainted, a poison that seeps into the very fabric of our intentions.\n\nWe've made our statement, a resounding declaration that will echo through the annals of time. But the cacophony of war has continued, a prolonged dirge that grows louder with each passing day. We've lost sight of the objective, succumbed to the siren song of war, an endless and mindless dance. The costs mount, a staggering tally of lives, a hemorrhage of our economy, a bleeding wound that refuses to clot.\n\nAnd for what? To prove our power? To assert our dominance? The nations we've been fighting to \"liberate\" have grown weary, their governments learning to fend for themselves, while our own coffers are drained, our people suffering, and our future uncertain. We've forgotten the people we set out to help, their struggles, their hopes, their dreams. We've become entangled in the quagmire of war, our own priorities lost in the mire.\n\nWe pour billions into a conflict that has long since lost its purpose, while our own cities beg for attention, our people cry out for aid. The war has become a cancer, a festering wound that refuses to heal. We've lost sight of our own priorities, our own needs, our own humanity. It's time to cut the umbilical cord, to sever the ties that bind us to this conflict. It's time to bring our soldiers home, to tend to our own wounds, to find a new path forward, a path that leads us towards a brighter future, a future where our economy thrives, our people prosper, and our hearts are not weighed down by the burden of war.",
            "In a world where the boundaries of surveillance are as indistinct as the horizon, the notion of privacy has grown tenuous.  The vast expanse of the internet, like an unforgiving desert, stretches out before us, inviting the unwary traveler to leave their footprints for all to see. Myspace, a digital agora, beckons with its promise of connection and community, yet its allure is treacherous, for in its depths, the prying eyes of strangers lurk, waiting to strike.\n\nConsider this: when we surrender our information to the void of cyberspace, we tacitly consent to its dissemination.  A friend request, a click, a keystroke – all these can be the keys that unlock a Pandora's box of scrutiny.  The notion that we can control who sees what is a myth, a chimera born of our own hubris.  The internet, a vast and insatiable creature, devours our secrets and spits them back out, unrecognizable, to the world.\n\nBut what of the individual who stumbles upon our digital trail?  Is it the voyeur, the stalker, or the guardian angel who intervenes to prevent a catastrophe?  Or is it merely the happenstance of the digital age, where information flows like a river, unregulated and unfettered?  The line between these dichotomies blurs, leaving us to navigate the treacherous shoals of the digital world, ever vigilant, yet ever vulnerable.\n\nI recall a television program I once watched, a cautionary tale of a man who reveled in his ability to uncover the hidden truths of the internet.  He stalked a young girl, gathering her digital breadcrumbs, until he had ensnared her in his web of deceit.  I shuddered at the ease with which he had accomplished this feat, the speed at which he had insinuated himself into her world.  It was a sobering reminder of the perils that lurk in the digital shadows, waiting to pounce upon the unsuspecting.\n\nAnd yet, we cannot help but be drawn to this digital promised land, this frontier of connection and community.  We crave the intimacy of online relationships, the ease of communication, the promise of connection.  But we must be aware of the risks, the potential consequences of our actions in this unforgiving world.  We must be mindful of the information we share, the doors we open, the windows we leave unlatched.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance we must strike, a precarious tightrope walk between the benefits and the dangers of the digital age.  We must be aware, yet not paranoid; connected, yet cautious.  For in this vast and often unforgiving expanse, our digital footprints can lead us down a path from which we may never return.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the world's collective judgment, the Iraq War stands as a barren and lifeless thing, a monument to the futility of human endeavor. It's a truth we'd rather not confront, yet one that's palpable in the air, a stench that clings to us like the ash of a long-dead fire. To speak of it now feels like a betrayal, a joining of the chorus of voices that bemoan its folly, a bandwagon we'd rather not be a part of.\n\nAnd yet, it's a truth that's inescapable. The polls, a litany of consensus, echo through the wasteland like the whispers of the dead. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, Iraqi and foreign alike, view it as a calamity, a debacle born of hubris and ignorance. Even the troops, the soldiers who toil in the quagmire, share this assessment, their voices a muted whisper in the darkness, a reluctant admission of the futility of their endeavor.\n\nIt's a disaster, a catastrophe that unfolded long before the ink was dry on the invasion plans. A disaster that's been perpetuated by the very people who promised to bring order to the chaos, to impose their brand of democracy on a culture that rejects it. The chasm between the West and the Middle East yawns wide, a gulf that's too great to bridge, a gulf that's been exacerbated by the very actions of those who sought to bridge it.\n\nWe're not the arbiters of another people's fate, nor should we pretend to be. Saddam was a monster, a tyrant who brought suffering to his own people. But to weigh the pros and cons, to balance the scales of justice, requires a wisdom we've yet to demonstrate. The cons, like quicksand, have sucked us in, ensnared us in a morass from which there's no easy escape.\n\nThe reasons for staying are thin, a threadbare excuse for a policy that's lost all coherence. The administration's hopeful ideas, like mirages on the horizon, vanish upon closer inspection. The problems of withdrawal, they say, are too great to contemplate. But I see no reason to stay, no reason to perpetuate a cycle of violence and suffering.\n\nAnd so we're left with the words of the Iraqis themselves, the people we claim to be saving, the people who tell us to leave. Eighty percent of them, a majority, demand our departure within the year. A quarter, a vocal minority, urge us to leave now. It's a message we'd do well to heed, a message that says we're not the saviors we claim to be, that we're not the solution to their problems.\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, not as long as we're imposing our will on theirs. But if we listen to their voices, if we heed their words, perhaps we can begin to crawl out of this abyss, to find a path that's not strewn with the ashes of our failed endeavors. Perhaps, just perhaps, we can find a way to leave with some semblance of dignity, to extricate ourselves from this quagmire and begin anew.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a society worn down by the relentless march of time, the specter of inequality persists. It is a ghost that haunts the corridors of progress, a specter that refuses to be vanquished by the cold light of day. The issue of gender discrimination, in particular, remains a festering wound, a reminder of the deep-seated prejudices that still linger in the recesses of our collective consciousness.\n\nIt is not a problem unique to women, for men also struggle beneath the weight of societal expectations. The glass ceiling, that impenetrable barrier that bars women from the highest echelons of power, is matched by a less visible but no less insidious bias that can afflict men in certain industries. The fashion world, for instance, is often characterized by a narrow and exclusive aesthetic, one that valorizes certain styles of life and dismisses others as superficial or frivolous.\n\nIn the rarefied realm of high society, men who dare to venture into the world of fashion are often met with suspicion and disdain. Their masculinity is called into question, their motivations seen as suspect. They are viewed as outsiders, as if their participation in this realm is somehow less authentic than that of their female counterparts. It is a pernicious form of prejudice, one that is rooted in a deep-seated discomfort with the notion of men expressing themselves through fashion.\n\nAnd yet, as we navigate this treacherous landscape, we must also acknowledge the ways in which societal norms can work to exclude those from certain backgrounds or with certain abilities. A man from a rural background, with a strong work ethic and a keen intellect, may find himself at a disadvantage when competing for positions of power. His grammar may not be polished, his accent may be rough, and yet he may possess a wisdom and a depth of character that are overlooked in favor of more polished, more refined candidates.\n\nSo too, women who choose to stay at home and raise their children may be met with scorn and derision, their choices seen as somehow less valid than those of their counterparts in the workforce. And yet, as the world changes, as we slowly but inexorably move towards a more enlightened understanding of what it means to be human, we must recognize that these biases are not inherent, but rather a product of a particular set of cultural and historical circumstances.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we must work to promote understanding and empathy, to challenge the status quo and to create a more inclusive, more compassionate society. It is a slow and difficult process, one that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to listen to and learn from those who may hold different perspectives. But as we strive towards this goal, we must remember that change is possible, that even the most entrenched biases can be overcome with time, effort, and a willingness to see the world in a different light.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of whether we can overcome these biases, but rather when. For in a world that is increasingly global, increasingly interconnected, we have no choice but to recognize the inherent value and worth of every individual, regardless of their background, their abilities, or their choices. We must see the world in all its complexity, in all its messiness, and strive to create a society that is truly just, truly equitable, and truly reflective of the diversity that makes us human.",
            "In a land where laws lay like the ashes of a burned world, the notion of what was once a transgression had been reduced to naught but a citation, a mere ticket to be paid and forgotten. The legalization of a certain substance, a plant once shunned and reviled, had brought forth a new era of tolerance, or perhaps merely a shrugging of the shoulders. The city of Denver, where the winds of progress howled like a mournful sigh, had taken the first step, a hesitant giant lumbering forth into the light.\n\nThe cost of arresting, booking, and housing those who partook in this once-forbidden pastime had been a weighty burden, a millstone around the neck of the municipal coffers. But now, with the weight lifted, the city's purse was free to attend to more pressing matters: the education of its youth, the care of its elderly, and the feeding of its hungry. A windfall, some would say, but others would caution that the devil was in the details.\n\nFor in a world where the boundaries between right and wrong had grown hazy, the specter of a substance-fueled society loomed large. The streets, once a battleground of competing interests, now teetered on the edge of a new reality, one where the line between indulgence and debasement was blurred. The taboo, that unseen hand that guided the masses, seemed to falter, its grip weakening with each passing day.\n\nSome would argue that the effects of this substance, while perhaps not as debilitating as those of its more potent cousin, held its own set of perils. The lifestyle it fostered, a world of lounging and lethargy, was a far cry from the dynamism that had once driven humanity forward. And yet, others would counter that each individual was unique, a snowflake in a world of chaos, and that the effects of this substance, like those of any other, were as varied as the stars in the night sky.\n\nIn the end, it was a matter of perspective, a matter of weighing the pros and cons, of considering the world as it was, and the world as it might be. For in a land where the winds of change howled through the streets, the only constant was uncertainty, and the only truth was that nothing was as it seemed.\n\nIn this world, where the language of morality was constantly in flux, the question remained: what was the true cost of progress? Was it the freedom to indulge, or the freedom to choose? Only time would tell, as the city of Denver, like a ship sailing into the unknown, charted its course through the uncharted waters of a new era.",
            "The truth is, I'd say yes. Because in the end, it's the beauty of tradition that endures. Like the rituals we cling to, day in and day out. The comfort of familiar patterns, worn smooth by the passage of time. It's a thing to be cherished, a bulwark against the void. But, like the shifting sands of the desert, we must adapt, must yield to the forces of change. The Catholic Church, with its doctrine and dogma, is a behemoth of tradition, a monolith that stands steadfast against the currents of the world. Yet, in its strict adherence to the past, it often forgets the very principles it holds dear. The love of others, a tenet of the faith, is oft subverted by the intolerance that masquerades as orthodoxy. It's a disease that infects the body of the Church, a cancer that eats away at its very soul.\n\nThe hypocrisy is palpable, a stench that clings to the fabric of the institution like a shroud. We are taught to love, yet we are not taught to accept. We are taught to follow the dogma, no matter the cost. It's a relic of a bygone era, a fossilized remnant of a time long past. And yet, the Church clings to it, a stubborn, blind creature driven by a will to survive, rather than a desire to evolve.\n\nAs for the issue of priests marrying, I'm not convinced it's the solution to the problem of pedophilia. Those who would prey on the innocent do so out of a diseased heart, not a lack of a spouse. Marriage or no marriage, they would still act, driven by their twisted desires. It's a sickness that cannot be cured by a simple change in circumstances. But, I suppose, it's a step in the right direction, a nod to the reality of human nature. After all, we are creatures of flesh and blood, subject to the frailties and weaknesses that beset us all.\n\nIn the end, it's not the institution that matters, but the individuals who comprise it. And it's the individuals who must be held accountable for their actions, not the rituals and dogma that surround them. The Church may be a vessel, but it's the people who fill it, who give it life, who make it holy. And it's the people who must be judged, not the structures that they inhabit.",
            "The mire of this issue thickens, a Gordian knot of conflicting sentiments. To address it, one must navigate the thin line between the sacred and the secular, the state and the church. Marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil union to others. Yet, is it not the latter, a bond between two individuals, that should be recognized by the government? The lines blur, and I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this debate. If marriage is a sacrament, then perhaps it should be left to the churches to define, lest the government meddles in the affairs of the divine. But if it is a civil union, then why not extend the same rights, the same privileges, to all who enter into such a bond, regardless of the manner in which they are joined?\n\nI do not pretend to have an answer, nor do I propose a solution. The issue seems too complex, too fraught with the potential for hurt and division. Yet, if we are to address it, we must do so with care and sensitivity. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? It seems a heavy-handed approach, one that disregards the nuance and complexity of this issue. The Constitution should not be amended for the whims of a minority, no matter how passionate their cause.\n\nAnd so, I stand at a remove, uncertain and unclear. The debate rages on, a maelstrom of opinion and emotion. I can only hope that, in the end, reason and compassion will prevail.",
            "In the shadow of my upbringing, a Christian home, I have come to regard the issue of homosexuality as a labyrinth of ambiguity. The lines that once seemed so clear have grown indistinct, like the outlines of a landscape shrouded in mist. My friendships with individuals who identify as gay have only served to muddle the waters further. I am torn between the certainties of my upbringing and the complexities of the world around me.\n\nThe question of legalization hangs in the balance, a pendulum swinging between the poles of acceptance and rejection. I do not subscribe to the notion that it should be a national issue, a matter for the president to dictate. Each state, with its unique character and values, should be free to chart its own course. The democratic states, with their liberal leanings, will likely champion the cause, while the more conservative states will resist. In such a scenario, it is the individual who chooses to reside in a given state who must abide by its laws and customs. I propose that we grant homosexuals the same rights and opportunities as their heterosexual counterparts, leaving the decision to legalize same-sex marriage to the discretion of each state.\n\nThe notion that the president should impose his will on the entire nation is a notion I find troubling. George Bush, for instance, has seen fit to ban gay marriage, but his authority extends only to the office he occupies. He does not reside in every state, and it is the people of each state who should decide how they wish to govern themselves. The president's tenure is fleeting, and with the passage of time, the pendulum will swing once more. It is the states, with their distinctive cultures and values, that must bear the weight of this decision, not the president.\n\nI do not condone the notion that the president should impose his will on the nation. In the end, it is the individual states that must live with the consequences of their decisions. I do not believe it is for the president to dictate how each state should govern itself.",
            "The notion of privacy in a world where the very fabric of the internet hangs like a gossamer thread for all to see is a tenuous thing. A public platform like Myspace, where one's thoughts and words are laid bare for the world to scrutinize, invites the gaze of others. The school officials, with their desire to safeguard the students, might see it as a necessary intrusion, a means to prevent the very horrors that have befallen places like Columbine. But does this not tread a fine line between protection and invasion?\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between public and private have grown increasingly blurred, it is a question of what we mean by 'public'. Is it not true that anything placed upon the internet is, in effect, a public declaration? And does this not give those who govern the right to intervene, to prevent the spread of ideas that might lead to harm? The notion that the internet is a sanctuary of sorts, a place where one can freely express oneself without consequence, is a myth. The digital trail we leave behind is a testament to our every thought, our every action.\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher of mine, a discussion about the measures taken to ensure the safety of the students. The lockdown drills, the protocols in place for instances of violence. It was a means to prepare for the worst, to prevent the unthinkable. And is this not what the school officials were attempting to do in this case? To prevent a tragedy, to safeguard the students? The line between invasion and protection is thin, and it is a line that we must continually reassess in this brave new world of ours.\n\nThe ease with which we can express ourselves online is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows us to convey our thoughts and feelings to a vast audience. On the other, it leaves us vulnerable to the prying eyes of others. We are our own worst enemies in this regard, our fears and doubts laid bare for all to see. And once something is posted online, it is there forever, a digital scar that cannot be erased.\n\nIt is a delicate balance we must strike, one that requires us to weigh the importance of freedom of expression against the need for protection. And it is a balance that will continue to shift, as the world around us evolves and adapts. But in the end, it is a question of what we value most: our right to express ourselves, or our right to be safe.",
            "In the blackened expanse of a mind still reeling from the aftershocks of a distant atrocity, the disquieting echoes of nine-eleven lingered like a miasma. A wound that refused to close, it festering and festering until it became an open sore that wept with every passing day. In its wake, a tide of emotion swept across the nation, a maelstrom of anger and fear that threatened to consume all in its path. And in the midst of this tempest, a decision was made to intervene, to insert ourselves into the crucible of a foreign land, to remake it in our own image. But the hubris of this endeavor was a siren's call, luring us into the treacherous waters of a conflict that would prove to be a quagmire, a quicksand that sucked in the unwary and spat out the broken.\n\nAt first, the zeal to act was a palpable thing, a fire that burned bright and hot, consuming all in its path. But as the embers of that initial fervor cooled, the outlines of a more nuanced reality began to emerge. The people we sought to save were not so easily saved, their struggles and triumphs a far cry from our own. War, for them, was a different beast, a savagery that knew no quarter, a endless cycle of violence and retaliation. And we, with our idealism and our hubris, had stumbled into this maelstrom unprepared, our plans a ragged and tattered thing, our motivations a mix of revenge and benevolence.\n\nIn the end, it was this lack of preparation, this failure to grasp the intricacies of a foreign land and its people, that would prove to be our undoing. We had gone in with a sense of superiority, of a civilizing force, but what we found was a complex tapestry of hatreds and resentments, a skein of rivalries and vendettas that we could not untangle. And so we became embroiled, our presence a constant thorn in the side of the very people we sought to help, our efforts to impose order and stability thwarted at every turn.\n\nNow, looking back, it is clear that we were mistaken, that our intervention was a folly, a well-intentioned but catastrophic mistake. We had thought to remake the world in our image, but what we created was a mess, a chaos of conflicting interests and unbridgeable divides. And so we must now extricate ourselves, withdraw from this quagmire, and let the people of that land find their own way. For we are not the ones to change them, to impose our will upon them. They are a people with their own history, their own culture, and their own destiny. And it is time for us to acknowledge this, to recognize the limits of our power, and to withdraw, humbled and chastened, from this foreign soil.\n\nBut the memories of that fateful day linger, a ghostly presence that haunts our collective psyche, a reminder of the perils of hubris and the dangers of intervention. And so we must learn from this, must recognize the limits of our power, and must strive to be more mindful in our actions, to think more carefully before we act, to consider the long-term consequences of our decisions. For in the end, it is not the mighty who shall inherit the earth, but the wise, the cautious, and the humble."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the depths of a world where shadows of doubt crept in, where the once unshakeable foundations of the Catholic Church wavered, a whispered question arose. Do they cling to the familiar, or do they surrender to the tides of change? The institution, once a bastion of tradition, now teetered on the precipice, its grip on the faithful beginning to loosen. The winds of time howled through its halls, casting aspersions on the Church's rigid stance on matters of the heart.\n\nLike a withered leaf, the Church's views on certain issues – the sanctity of life, the bonds of love, the sacraments of birth and death – seemed to cling tenuously to the branches of time, yellowed and brittle. The world outside moved forward, its pace quickening with each passing day, while the Church's stance remained frozen, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIt was said that the faithful were deserting, their numbers dwindling as the Church's rigidity only served to drive them further away. The din of dissent grew louder, a cacophony of voices that echoed through the desolate landscape of a world in flux. The Church's stance on matters of the heart seemed to be an anachronism, a stubborn refusal to bend in the face of changing times.\n\nOne could not help but wonder, in a world where love and compassion were the guiding principles, why the Church clung so tenaciously to its dogma. Why, in a world where the bonds of family and community were stretched taut, did the Church insist on its doctrine of celibacy? The question hung in the air, a challenge to the very fabric of the institution.\n\nThe winds of change howled on, a maelstrom that threatened to consume the Church whole. And yet, in the midst of the turmoil, a glimmer of hope flickered, a whispered promise that the Church might yet find a way to adapt, to bend without breaking. For in a world where love and acceptance were the keys to salvation, perhaps the Church's greatest challenge lay not in resisting the tides of change, but in embracing them.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, where the very foundations of the Church trembled, a question echoed through the void: could the Catholic Church find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the demands of a new world? Or would it succumb to the weight of its own rigidity, lost in a sea of time? Only the future held the answer, a future that hung precariously in the balance, like a leaf on the winds of change.",
            "The world is not a canvas for our petty judgments. It is a tapestry of complexities, woven from threads of fate and circumstance. And yet, we find ourselves drawn into the vortex of moral absolutes, our minds grasping for certainties in a sea of uncertainty. I, like many, have found myself adrift in this maelstrom, struggling to find footing on the shifting sands of opinion. The question of gay marriage, a topic that has gained prominence in these tumultuous times, has been a source of consternation for me.\n\nAs I ponder the issue, I am reminded of the fundamental truth that we are not born as blank slates, waiting to be inscribed with the characters of our destiny. Our very existence is a tapestry of choices and circumstances, yet there are some things that lie beyond our control. The same goes for the question of sexual orientation. It is a mystery, a labyrinth that we navigate without the benefit of a map or compass. We are not born with the choices of our lives already made, but with the capacity to forge our own path.\n\nThe notion that a person's sexual orientation is a choice, a conscious decision to defy societal norms, strikes me as a fallacy. It is a sentiment that reeks of a narrow-mindedness that seeks to impose its will on the complexities of human nature. Gay people, like all of us, are not aberrations, but rather an integral part of the human experience.\n\nTo deny them the right to marriage, to love, and to live their lives as they see fit, is to perpetuate a false narrative that we are the sole arbiters of what is right and wrong. It is a hubris that forgets that our understanding of the world is but a mere fraction of the grand tapestry. We are not the authors of the script, but merely characters in a story that is being written by forces beyond our comprehension.\n\nThe federal government, in its attempts to regulate the private lives of its citizens, oversteps its bounds. It is not our duty to impose our moral vision on others, but rather to create a society that allows individuals to live their lives as they see fit, so long as they do not harm others. It is a delicate balance, one that requires us to be mindful of our own limitations and the infinite complexities of human nature.\n\nIn the end, it is not for us to judge, but to allow. To create a world where love knows no bounds, where people can be themselves without fear of persecution or marginalization. It is a world that is not yet realized, but one that we must strive for, lest we forget the simple truth that we are all human, bound together by our shared experiences and our capacity for compassion.",
            "In the desolate expanse of this cold and forsaken land, where the tree of reason seems to wither and die, there remains a beacon of hope - the hope for equality, for the unwavering pursuit of justice, and for the unrelenting quest for truth. The issue of gay marriage is a matter of stark simplicity, a binary choice between the light of acceptance and the dark of prejudice. And yet, the fervent opposition to it is a palpable force, a maelstrom of fear and misunderstanding that threatens to consume us all.\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the institution of heterosexual marriage is a canard, a feeble excuse for the intolerance that festers in the hearts of those who cling to the status quo. The truth is, the essence of marriage is not bound by the shackles of biology, but by the indomitable spirit of love and commitment. Two individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, can form a bond that is just as strong, just as deep, and just as worthy of recognition as any other.\n\nThe defense of civil rights is not a partisan issue, nor is it a matter of personal opinion. It is a fundamental human right, a cornerstone of our democracy, and a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of compassion. The struggles of gay couples are not unlike those of any other couple - they face the same trials, the same tribulations, and the same triumphs. And it is precisely this shared humanity that we must acknowledge and celebrate, rather than deny and exclude.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a sacrosanct principle, one that has been enshrined in our Constitution. To allow the government to codify the tenets of a particular faith, be it Christianity or any other, is to invite the kind of hypocrisy that has ravaged our society for far too long. The phrase \"separate but equal\" has been used to justify the most heinous of injustices, and it is our duty to reject its pernicious influence once and for all.\n\nThe fear of the unknown, the fear of change, and the fear of difference are powerful engines of intolerance. They fuel the fires of prejudice, and they fuel the flames of hatred. But they are also the very things that we must confront, that we must overcome, and that we must vanquish if we are to create a society that is just, equitable, and fair for all.\n\nThe scientific community has spoken, and it is clear that homosexual relationships are not inherently defective, nor are they a product of childhood trauma or personal pathology. The American Psychological Association has weighed in, and its findings are unequivocal - the notion that gay people are somehow flawed or inferior is a myth, a lie, and a calumny.\n\nIn the end, it is not about politics, or ideology, or even morality. It is about humanity. It is about our capacity for compassion, our ability to empathize, and our willingness to see the world through the eyes of another. It is about recognizing that we are not so different, that we are all part of a shared human experience, and that our differences are what make us strong, not weak.\n\nSo let us not be swayed by the siren song of fear, of intolerance, and of ignorance. Let us not be deterred by the opposition of those who would seek to deny us our basic human rights. Let us stand tall, let us stand proud, and let us demand that our voices be heard. For in the end, it is not just about gay marriage - it is about the very fabric of our society, and the kind of world we want to create for ourselves and for future generations.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital, a summer's toil, I find myself entwined with the shadows of the pharmacy. The shadows cast by the fluorescent lights, a cold and unforgiving glow that seeps into the very marrow of one's bones. It is here, amidst the sterile counters and the rows of bottles, that I find myself grappling with the complexities of a world in flux. The question that hangs in the air, like a specter, is one of morality and the role of the forbidden. \n\nJust because a substance is proscribed, does it not possess some hidden virtue? Does its utility in the realm of medicine not outweigh the taboos that surround it? I think of the oxycodone and the Vicodin, the Percocet, used by my colleagues with frequency and with purpose. These are drugs, I am told, that hold no place in the world of the uninhibited. Yet, in the world of the hospital, they are nothing short of essential. The distinction, it seems to me, is a curious one.\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is a tired one. We all know the perils of excess, the ruin that can be wrought by overindulgence. But the similarities between the two substances are limited. The danger lies, I think, not in the substance itself, but in the manner of its use. Remove the stigma, the shroud of prohibition, and perhaps, just perhaps, we may find a more responsible path.\n\nThe image of marijuana, a caricature of a substance, held in the public eye, is one of degradation and decay. It is a picture of a world gone mad, of lives ruined by the very thing that might have brought solace. But is this image not a distortion? Is it not a product of our own fears and our own biases? I think of the heroin and the cocaine, the true scourges of our time. The comparison to marijuana is a false one, a convenient smokescreen designed to obscure the truth.\n\nIn the end, it is not the substance itself that is the problem, but our own perceptions, our own fears. Remove the taboos, the shrouds of prohibition, and perhaps, just perhaps, we may find a new path, a path of responsibility and of reason.",
            "The church has undergone a metamorphosis, its staid traditions yielding to the demands of the twenty-first century. The once rigid facade now appears more relaxed, a facade worn down by the gentle lapping of time. As a child, I was accustomed to Sundays spent within its hallowed halls, my attire a pristine, cookie-cutter reflection of the expectations that governed my early years. Matching dresses, shoes, and purses – a uniform that signified not only my belonging but also my devotion. Those were simpler times, ones that waned as I grew older.\n\nAt my private school, I would catch glimpses of my friends on weekends, all of us hurrying to and fro, our footsteps echoing within the church's hallowed walls. But as the years passed, the church adapted, its rituals condensed to thirty minutes, a hurried sacrifice to the pace of modern life. Summer mornings saw families arrive in beach attire, the very emblem of a world in disarray. Even morning masses, once a bastion of propriety, now welcomed the casual, the jeans and khakis a testament to a more relaxed era.\n\nAs I reflect on my experiences, I am struck by the changing times, the church a reflection of the world at large. I do not pretend to understand the inner workings of the church's politics, nor do I wish to delve into the complex web of allegations surrounding its clergy. My observations, though limited, suggest that the church's strictures did little to prevent the scourge of pedophilia.\n\nThe notion that allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference is a notion I find difficult to accept. Pedophilia, I believe, is a product of an individual's nature, a predisposition that cannot be altered by the trappings of marriage or the blessings of the church. Even in faiths that permit marriage among their clergy, the aberrant individual will still find a way to indulge their baser desires. It is a choice, a choice made by the individual, not by the institution.\n\nIn the end, it seems to me that the church's inability to prevent these atrocities lies not in its practices but in the human condition. We are what we are, our inclinations shaped by forces beyond our control, genetics a primary driver of our nature. The church, in its attempts to police the desires of its clergy, may have been misguided, but it was not the root cause of this evil.\n\nAs I reflect on the church's place in the world, I am left with more questions than answers. Its role, once a beacon of hope and guidance, now seems a complex, multifaceted entity, one that must confront the darker aspects of human nature.",
            "The ghosts of September's ash still clung to the land like the stench of death on a winter's morning. The memories of that day, like the embers of a long-dead fire, continued to smolder, refusing to be extinguished. The administration's pyre of deceit had been built upon the altar of fear, and the flames of war had consumed the nation. The rhetoric of lies had been woven like a tapestry of deceit, with Saddam Hussein as the thread, Osama Bin Laden as the hook, and the WMDs as the bait.\n\nThe echoes of Colin Powell's hollow words still lingered in the air, a haunted whisper of a man who knew the truth but chose to ignore it. The evidence, like the desert sand, had shifted and slid, revealing the cracks in the administration's facade. The Constitution, that sacred document, had been cast aside like a worn and tattered cloak, trampled by the boots of power.\n\nThe younger Bush, driven by a vendetta born of blood and pride, had set his sights on Baghdad, his eyes fixed on the prize of oil, that black gold that flowed like lifeblood through the veins of the nation. The pretext, a flimsy thing, had been used to justify the slaughter, the terror, the devastation. The world had been fooled, convinced by the sweet whispers of a lie.\n\nAnd now, as the years had passed, the truth had begun to seep through the cracks, like water through the parched earth. The country teetered on the brink of chaos, a fragile thing, balanced precariously between the competing interests of the nations that had come to claim its prize. The Iraqi government, a fragile leaf, was blown by the winds of dissension, its sovereignty threatened by the very powers that had claimed to liberate it.\n\nThe Parliament, a gathering of disparate voices, was a cacophony of discord, a reminder that the Iraqis were not a people to be trifled with. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, was a mere puppet on a string, pulled by the invisible hands of the foreign powers that had brought him to power. The shadow of al-Sadr loomed large, a specter of rebellion, a reminder that the fire of resistance still burned bright.\n\nAnd so, the nation teetered, a delicate balance of power, a house of cards waiting to be blown down. The ghosts of September still lingered, a reminder of the horrors that had been unleashed. The lies, the deceit, the bloodshed – all of it still echoed through the halls of history, a grim reminder of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "I sat in the cold, my words lost in the void. The wind howled through the trees like a mournful cry, a dirge for the lost and the forgotten. I tried to speak, but the words would not come. Just a hollow murmur, a murmur that was swallowed by the silence.\n\nI cleared my throat, and began again. The War in Iraq. A conflict without end, a morass of blood and ash. I felt a sense of futility, a sense that our efforts were as fleeting as the wind that swept through the desolate landscape.\n\nIt was a war without a clear purpose, a war without a declared end. A war born of anger and revenge, of a desire to punish and to dominate. I thought of the children, the sons and daughters lost in the conflict, their lives forever changed by the violence and the bloodshed.\n\nI thought of the terrible weight of responsibility, the burden of power that rested on the shoulders of those who had unleashed this war. The promise of democracy, of freedom and prosperity, had been reduced to a hollow mantra, a justification for the destruction and the chaos that had been wrought.\n\nAnd yet, I was torn. I felt a sense of loyalty to those who had served, who had risked everything to defend a cause that was noble and just. But I also felt a sense of unease, a sense that our presence in Iraq was a cancer, a poison that was eating away at the very fabric of the country.\n\nI thought of the words of my predecessors, the ones who had spoken of the importance of engagement, of the need to build a better world. But I knew that words were cheap, that the cost of war was measured in blood and tears, not in empty rhetoric.\n\nI sighed, my breath misting in the cold air. The War in Iraq was a labyrinth, a maze of conflicting desires and ideologies. I did not know what to say, what to think. All I knew was that I was lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty and doubt.\n\nI paused, collecting my thoughts. Perhaps, I thought, the war was not just about Iraq, but about us. About our own fears and insecurities, our own need for power and control. Perhaps it was a reflection of our own darkness, our own shadow self.\n\nI looked out at the desolate landscape, the wind-whipped trees and the ash-stained rocks. It was a landscape of death and despair, a landscape that seemed to stretch on forever. And I knew that I was just a small part of it, a small part of a larger tapestry that was torn and frayed.\n\nI fell silent, my words lost in the void. The wind howled on, a mournful cry that seemed to echo through the ages.",
            "In the desolate landscape of politics, a canonical question hangs like a specter, shrouded in the murk of constitutional ambiguity. The separation of church and state, that bedrock principle of the American foundational text, stands as a bulwark against the encroachment of ecclesiastical power into the temporal realm. And yet, a proposed amendment seeks to upset this delicate balance, to insinuate the government's hand into the very fabric of faith, a move that would contravene the sacred compact of separation.\n\nThe constitution, that venerable document, speaks plainly on this matter, its words a testament to the founders' genius and foresight. And yet, in a seeming disregard for the written word, the proponents of this amendment would seek to impose their will, to impose their narrow vision on a nation founded on the principles of liberty and tolerance. The very notion is anathema to the spirit of American democracy, a spirit that prizes freedom above all else.\n\nIn the councils of power, a subtle but insidious force is at work, one that would reduce the rich tapestry of faith to a monolith of state-defined orthodoxy. The irony is not lost on those who would see this amendment as a thinly veiled attempt to privilege one creed over all others. And so they rail against the very idea, seeing in it a testament to the creeping influence of theocracy.\n\nThe economy, that great engine of progress, would be little affected, yet the proposed amendment would have far-reaching consequences, insidiously chipping away at the bedrock of American freedom. The societal impact, too, would be profound, as the very fabric of our national identity would be reshaped by the imposition of a state-defined dogma.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the state to dictate the terms of the divine, nor is it for the government to impose its will on the faithful. The churches, those venerable institutions of faith, must be free to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. For in the words of the constitution, the distinction between church and state is not a suggestion, but a fundamental imperative, a bulwark against the tyranny of the majority and the oppression of the minority.\n\nIn this, the proposed amendment would be a calamity, a betrayal of the trust that has been placed in us as citizens. We must stand against this thinly veiled attempt to subvert the constitution, to undermine the very foundations of our democracy. For in the words of the great American jurist, the constitution is not a document to be tinkered with, but a sacred trust, a beacon of hope in a world beset by darkness and despair.\n\nUltimately, it is not for the federal government, nor any government, to dictate the terms of faith. It is for the churches, those institutions of faith, to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. And so we must resist this amendment, this thinly veiled attempt to impose a state-defined dogma on a nation founded on the principles of liberty and tolerance. For in the end, it is not the state that should dictate the terms of the divine, but the faithful, free to worship as they see fit, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the government.",
            "The scar of war remains in the memory like a festering wound, a constant reminder of the deceit that festered in the heart of our nation. The invasion of Iraq, a calamitous event born of half-truths and misinformation, left an indelible stain on the conscience of our country. The government's motivations, shrouded in a veil of secrecy, were as opaque as the darkness that descended upon the land.\n\nLike a rot that had set deep within the bone, the reasons for war were infected with the germ of dishonesty. The government's attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the atrocities of 9/11, a connection as tenuous as the threads of a spider's web, was a palpable lie. Yet, it was a lie that resonated deeply with the American people, their emotions manipulated by the government's skilled artisans of propaganda. The echoes of that deceit still linger, a testament to the ease with which we can be led astray by the whispers of those in power.\n\nAs I reflect on the war in Iraq, I am reminded of the terrible toll it took on our nation. The countless lives lost, the families shattered, the futures forever altered. A war that seemed to promise a swift and easy victory, but instead became a quagmire of blood and chaos, a lesson we failed to learn from the mistakes of Vietnam. The government, blinded by its own hubris, failed to grasp the complexity of the situation, and the people paid the price.\n\nThe void left by the removal of Saddam's regime was a chasm as vast as the one that yawns between the promise and the reality of democracy. The government, like a ship without anchor, was swept up in the currents of its own ambition, failing to chart a course that would lead to a stable and peaceful outcome. The aftermath of the invasion was a maelstrom of violence and chaos, as the country was left to pick up the pieces of a shattered society.\n\nAs I grapple with the weight of these events, I am reminded of the words of my own father, who once spoke of the importance of planning for all possible outcomes. But in the rush to war, the government was woefully unprepared for the consequences of its actions. The loss of life, the destruction of infrastructure, the displacement of people – all of these were consequences that could have been foreseen, but were willfully ignored.\n\nThe war in Iraq serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of accountability. It is a cautionary tale of the devastating consequences of a government that prioritizes its own interests above the welfare of its people. As I look back on the events that transpired, I am left with a sense of sadness and regret, a feeling that we were complicit in our own downfall.\n\nThe question of whether we should have gone to war remains a difficult one, a Gordian knot that twists and turns in the mind. But one thing is certain – the war in Iraq was a catastrophic mistake, a tragedy that will haunt us for generations to come. As we move forward, we must learn from our mistakes and strive to create a world where the rule of law and the principles of justice are upheld. Anything less would be a betrayal of the very ideals that we claim to represent.\n\nThe scars of war will take a long time to heal, but it is in the darkness that we find the true measure of our character. It is in the willingness to confront the truth, to acknowledge our mistakes, and to strive for a better future. As we move forward, let us remember the lessons of Iraq, and may we emerge from the ashes of our hubris, wiser and more compassionate, our hearts heavy with the knowledge of what we have lost, and our spirits renewed by the promise of a brighter tomorrow.",
            "The air was heavy with the weight of what could not be said. He hesitated, the words caught in his throat like a choking ember. Gay marriage. A flame that flickered in the depths of his being, a fire that had long since burned away the shadows of doubt. It was a thing of the heart, not the mind, a whispered promise in the dark. He thought of the couples in his neighborhood, their love a beacon in the desolate landscape of his world. They walked the streets, their dogs by their side, just as any other family would. But to be recognized, to be acknowledged, was to invite the darkness of judgment.\n\nHe spoke of the biological, the chemical whispers in the brain, the predisposition that could not be changed. It was a thing of science, not society, a truth that stood apart from the fallible words of men. He thought of his own childhood, the absence of a father, the presence of sisters, and wondered if it made him any less a man. The sociological, the cultural, the expectations of a world that would not understand. It was all a web of deceit, a spider's snare that sought to entangle and ensnare.\n\nMarriage, a sacred bond, a union of two souls, was it not a thing of the heart, not the law? He thought of the couples who fled to Vegas, their love a secret, a stolen moment in the desert. But for those who loved in the shadows, in the silence, who spoke of love as a right, not a privilege. He thought of the newspapers, the headlines, the scrutinizing eyes of a world that would not be swayed. It was a thing of the public domain, of the federal, of the laws that bound and gagged the heart.\n\nHe shook his head, a slow, deliberate motion, as if to clear the cobwebs from his mind. The words, the arguments, the rationalizations, they were all mere smoke, a mist that obscured the truth. He thought of the couples, the love that shone like a beacon in the darkness, and knew that it was not for him to decide. It was for them to choose, to love, to live, to be.\n\nHis voice, a low, measured tone, cut through the air like a knife. I am for gay marriage. It is a thing of the heart, a flame that burns bright and true, a love that knows no bounds. It is a personal preference, a choice, a decision that should be left to those who love, not to the whims of men who would seek to dictate the terms of the heart.",
            "The thin veil of the digital realm, once thought to be a sanctuary, now hangs heavy with the weight of consequence. When words are set loose upon the winds of the internet, they are like autumn leaves, scattered and impossible to contain. The public forum, a landscape once traversed by the whispers of friends and acquaintances, has become a thoroughfare for the reckless and the malicious.\n\nAs an RA, I have witnessed the catastrophic aftermath of thoughtless utterances, the shards of shattered reputations that litter the digital terrain like the splintered remnants of a shattered glass. The ephemeral nature of online discourse belies its far-reaching consequences, for once released, words cannot be recalled. They seep into the consciousness of others, indelibly staining their perceptions.\n\nThe incident at our school serves as a stark illustration of this phenomenon. A careless remark, meant as a jest, was overheard and reported, setting in motion a chain of events that culminated in a thorough investigation. The ease with which one's digital footprint can be accessed, the lack of boundaries between the private and public spheres, is a stark reminder of the perils of online expression.\n\nIn this vast, uncharted expanse, the lines between jest and earnest are frequently blurred. The internet, a reflection of humanity's darker impulses, can amplify the most base and hurtful sentiments, rendering them audible to all. It is a realm where the distinction between intention and consequence is lost, where the ephemeral nature of words is exploited by the malicious.\n\nThe inherent lack of control, the vulnerability to the whims of others, is a reality that must be acknowledged. While school officials may not be entitled to monitor the online activities of their students, the moment a threat or concern is brought to their attention, they are duty-bound to act. It is a delicate balance, one that requires a nuanced understanding of the digital landscape and its far-reaching implications.\n\nIn this context, the creation of online personas, the friending of students, and the monitoring of their online activities are all fraught with peril. The blurring of boundaries, the invasion of privacy, can have far-reaching consequences, both for the individual and the community. It is a minefield that requires great care and sensitivity to navigate.\n\nUltimately, the internet, a double-edged sword, holds the power to both unite and divide. As we traverse this uncharted territory, we must proceed with caution, mindful of the words we choose to utter, the lines we cross, and the consequences that follow. For in the digital realm, the past and present are inextricably linked, and the shadows of our online actions can haunt us for eternity.",
            "The war, a drawn-out thing, a slow unraveling of purpose. What once was a beacon of hope, a shining light to guide us towards democracy, has lost its way. The shadow of the original intent lingers, a fleeting memory of a reason that once burned bright. Now it's a meandering path, a purpose lost in the haze of time.\n\nIn the beginning, the desire to restore democracy in another land was a noble pursuit. A crusade to free the oppressed, to give voice to those silenced by tyranny. But like a statue worn by the elements, the motive has eroded, gradually losing its shape and definition. It's become a monotonous drone, a justification for the sake of justification. A war of attrition, where the only victory is the mere act of continued existence.\n\nThe threads of our original purpose have frayed, tangled in the complexities of history. The recollections of George Bush's predecessor and Saddam Hussein's past grievances have become a tangled skein, a noose that chokes the air from our lungs. If our aim was to plant the seeds of democracy, perhaps it was not an unworthy endeavor. But when personal vendettas bleed into the equation, the endeavor becomes tainted, a poison that seeps into the very fabric of our intentions.\n\nWe've made our statement, a resounding declaration that will echo through the annals of time. But the cacophony of war has continued, a prolonged dirge that grows louder with each passing day. We've lost sight of the objective, succumbed to the siren song of war, an endless and mindless dance. The costs mount, a staggering tally of lives, a hemorrhage of our economy, a bleeding wound that refuses to clot.\n\nAnd for what? To prove our power? To assert our dominance? The nations we've been fighting to \"liberate\" have grown weary, their governments learning to fend for themselves, while our own coffers are drained, our people suffering, and our future uncertain. We've forgotten the people we set out to help, their struggles, their hopes, their dreams. We've become entangled in the quagmire of war, our own priorities lost in the mire.\n\nWe pour billions into a conflict that has long since lost its purpose, while our own cities beg for attention, our people cry out for aid. The war has become a cancer, a festering wound that refuses to heal. We've lost sight of our own priorities, our own needs, our own humanity. It's time to cut the umbilical cord, to sever the ties that bind us to this conflict. It's time to bring our soldiers home, to tend to our own wounds, to find a new path forward, a path that leads us towards a brighter future, a future where our economy thrives, our people prosper, and our hearts are not weighed down by the burden of war.",
            "In a world where the boundaries of surveillance are as indistinct as the horizon, the notion of privacy has grown tenuous.  The vast expanse of the internet, like an unforgiving desert, stretches out before us, inviting the unwary traveler to leave their footprints for all to see. Myspace, a digital agora, beckons with its promise of connection and community, yet its allure is treacherous, for in its depths, the prying eyes of strangers lurk, waiting to strike.\n\nConsider this: when we surrender our information to the void of cyberspace, we tacitly consent to its dissemination.  A friend request, a click, a keystroke – all these can be the keys that unlock a Pandora's box of scrutiny.  The notion that we can control who sees what is a myth, a chimera born of our own hubris.  The internet, a vast and insatiable creature, devours our secrets and spits them back out, unrecognizable, to the world.\n\nBut what of the individual who stumbles upon our digital trail?  Is it the voyeur, the stalker, or the guardian angel who intervenes to prevent a catastrophe?  Or is it merely the happenstance of the digital age, where information flows like a river, unregulated and unfettered?  The line between these dichotomies blurs, leaving us to navigate the treacherous shoals of the digital world, ever vigilant, yet ever vulnerable.\n\nI recall a television program I once watched, a cautionary tale of a man who reveled in his ability to uncover the hidden truths of the internet.  He stalked a young girl, gathering her digital breadcrumbs, until he had ensnared her in his web of deceit.  I shuddered at the ease with which he had accomplished this feat, the speed at which he had insinuated himself into her world.  It was a sobering reminder of the perils that lurk in the digital shadows, waiting to pounce upon the unsuspecting.\n\nAnd yet, we cannot help but be drawn to this digital promised land, this frontier of connection and community.  We crave the intimacy of online relationships, the ease of communication, the promise of connection.  But we must be aware of the risks, the potential consequences of our actions in this unforgiving world.  We must be mindful of the information we share, the doors we open, the windows we leave unlatched.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance we must strike, a precarious tightrope walk between the benefits and the dangers of the digital age.  We must be aware, yet not paranoid; connected, yet cautious.  For in this vast and often unforgiving expanse, our digital footprints can lead us down a path from which we may never return.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the world's collective judgment, the Iraq War stands as a barren and lifeless thing, a monument to the futility of human endeavor. It's a truth we'd rather not confront, yet one that's palpable in the air, a stench that clings to us like the ash of a long-dead fire. To speak of it now feels like a betrayal, a joining of the chorus of voices that bemoan its folly, a bandwagon we'd rather not be a part of.\n\nAnd yet, it's a truth that's inescapable. The polls, a litany of consensus, echo through the wasteland like the whispers of the dead. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, Iraqi and foreign alike, view it as a calamity, a debacle born of hubris and ignorance. Even the troops, the soldiers who toil in the quagmire, share this assessment, their voices a muted whisper in the darkness, a reluctant admission of the futility of their endeavor.\n\nIt's a disaster, a catastrophe that unfolded long before the ink was dry on the invasion plans. A disaster that's been perpetuated by the very people who promised to bring order to the chaos, to impose their brand of democracy on a culture that rejects it. The chasm between the West and the Middle East yawns wide, a gulf that's too great to bridge, a gulf that's been exacerbated by the very actions of those who sought to bridge it.\n\nWe're not the arbiters of another people's fate, nor should we pretend to be. Saddam was a monster, a tyrant who brought suffering to his own people. But to weigh the pros and cons, to balance the scales of justice, requires a wisdom we've yet to demonstrate. The cons, like quicksand, have sucked us in, ensnared us in a morass from which there's no easy escape.\n\nThe reasons for staying are thin, a threadbare excuse for a policy that's lost all coherence. The administration's hopeful ideas, like mirages on the horizon, vanish upon closer inspection. The problems of withdrawal, they say, are too great to contemplate. But I see no reason to stay, no reason to perpetuate a cycle of violence and suffering.\n\nAnd so we're left with the words of the Iraqis themselves, the people we claim to be saving, the people who tell us to leave. Eighty percent of them, a majority, demand our departure within the year. A quarter, a vocal minority, urge us to leave now. It's a message we'd do well to heed, a message that says we're not the saviors we claim to be, that we're not the solution to their problems.\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, not as long as we're imposing our will on theirs. But if we listen to their voices, if we heed their words, perhaps we can begin to crawl out of this abyss, to find a path that's not strewn with the ashes of our failed endeavors. Perhaps, just perhaps, we can find a way to leave with some semblance of dignity, to extricate ourselves from this quagmire and begin anew.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a society worn down by the relentless march of time, the specter of inequality persists. It is a ghost that haunts the corridors of progress, a specter that refuses to be vanquished by the cold light of day. The issue of gender discrimination, in particular, remains a festering wound, a reminder of the deep-seated prejudices that still linger in the recesses of our collective consciousness.\n\nIt is not a problem unique to women, for men also struggle beneath the weight of societal expectations. The glass ceiling, that impenetrable barrier that bars women from the highest echelons of power, is matched by a less visible but no less insidious bias that can afflict men in certain industries. The fashion world, for instance, is often characterized by a narrow and exclusive aesthetic, one that valorizes certain styles of life and dismisses others as superficial or frivolous.\n\nIn the rarefied realm of high society, men who dare to venture into the world of fashion are often met with suspicion and disdain. Their masculinity is called into question, their motivations seen as suspect. They are viewed as outsiders, as if their participation in this realm is somehow less authentic than that of their female counterparts. It is a pernicious form of prejudice, one that is rooted in a deep-seated discomfort with the notion of men expressing themselves through fashion.\n\nAnd yet, as we navigate this treacherous landscape, we must also acknowledge the ways in which societal norms can work to exclude those from certain backgrounds or with certain abilities. A man from a rural background, with a strong work ethic and a keen intellect, may find himself at a disadvantage when competing for positions of power. His grammar may not be polished, his accent may be rough, and yet he may possess a wisdom and a depth of character that are overlooked in favor of more polished, more refined candidates.\n\nSo too, women who choose to stay at home and raise their children may be met with scorn and derision, their choices seen as somehow less valid than those of their counterparts in the workforce. And yet, as the world changes, as we slowly but inexorably move towards a more enlightened understanding of what it means to be human, we must recognize that these biases are not inherent, but rather a product of a particular set of cultural and historical circumstances.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we must work to promote understanding and empathy, to challenge the status quo and to create a more inclusive, more compassionate society. It is a slow and difficult process, one that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to listen to and learn from those who may hold different perspectives. But as we strive towards this goal, we must remember that change is possible, that even the most entrenched biases can be overcome with time, effort, and a willingness to see the world in a different light.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of whether we can overcome these biases, but rather when. For in a world that is increasingly global, increasingly interconnected, we have no choice but to recognize the inherent value and worth of every individual, regardless of their background, their abilities, or their choices. We must see the world in all its complexity, in all its messiness, and strive to create a society that is truly just, truly equitable, and truly reflective of the diversity that makes us human.",
            "In a land where laws lay like the ashes of a burned world, the notion of what was once a transgression had been reduced to naught but a citation, a mere ticket to be paid and forgotten. The legalization of a certain substance, a plant once shunned and reviled, had brought forth a new era of tolerance, or perhaps merely a shrugging of the shoulders. The city of Denver, where the winds of progress howled like a mournful sigh, had taken the first step, a hesitant giant lumbering forth into the light.\n\nThe cost of arresting, booking, and housing those who partook in this once-forbidden pastime had been a weighty burden, a millstone around the neck of the municipal coffers. But now, with the weight lifted, the city's purse was free to attend to more pressing matters: the education of its youth, the care of its elderly, and the feeding of its hungry. A windfall, some would say, but others would caution that the devil was in the details.\n\nFor in a world where the boundaries between right and wrong had grown hazy, the specter of a substance-fueled society loomed large. The streets, once a battleground of competing interests, now teetered on the edge of a new reality, one where the line between indulgence and debasement was blurred. The taboo, that unseen hand that guided the masses, seemed to falter, its grip weakening with each passing day.\n\nSome would argue that the effects of this substance, while perhaps not as debilitating as those of its more potent cousin, held its own set of perils. The lifestyle it fostered, a world of lounging and lethargy, was a far cry from the dynamism that had once driven humanity forward. And yet, others would counter that each individual was unique, a snowflake in a world of chaos, and that the effects of this substance, like those of any other, were as varied as the stars in the night sky.\n\nIn the end, it was a matter of perspective, a matter of weighing the pros and cons, of considering the world as it was, and the world as it might be. For in a land where the winds of change howled through the streets, the only constant was uncertainty, and the only truth was that nothing was as it seemed.\n\nIn this world, where the language of morality was constantly in flux, the question remained: what was the true cost of progress? Was it the freedom to indulge, or the freedom to choose? Only time would tell, as the city of Denver, like a ship sailing into the unknown, charted its course through the uncharted waters of a new era.",
            "The truth is, I'd say yes. Because in the end, it's the beauty of tradition that endures. Like the rituals we cling to, day in and day out. The comfort of familiar patterns, worn smooth by the passage of time. It's a thing to be cherished, a bulwark against the void. But, like the shifting sands of the desert, we must adapt, must yield to the forces of change. The Catholic Church, with its doctrine and dogma, is a behemoth of tradition, a monolith that stands steadfast against the currents of the world. Yet, in its strict adherence to the past, it often forgets the very principles it holds dear. The love of others, a tenet of the faith, is oft subverted by the intolerance that masquerades as orthodoxy. It's a disease that infects the body of the Church, a cancer that eats away at its very soul.\n\nThe hypocrisy is palpable, a stench that clings to the fabric of the institution like a shroud. We are taught to love, yet we are not taught to accept. We are taught to follow the dogma, no matter the cost. It's a relic of a bygone era, a fossilized remnant of a time long past. And yet, the Church clings to it, a stubborn, blind creature driven by a will to survive, rather than a desire to evolve.\n\nAs for the issue of priests marrying, I'm not convinced it's the solution to the problem of pedophilia. Those who would prey on the innocent do so out of a diseased heart, not a lack of a spouse. Marriage or no marriage, they would still act, driven by their twisted desires. It's a sickness that cannot be cured by a simple change in circumstances. But, I suppose, it's a step in the right direction, a nod to the reality of human nature. After all, we are creatures of flesh and blood, subject to the frailties and weaknesses that beset us all.\n\nIn the end, it's not the institution that matters, but the individuals who comprise it. And it's the individuals who must be held accountable for their actions, not the rituals and dogma that surround them. The Church may be a vessel, but it's the people who fill it, who give it life, who make it holy. And it's the people who must be judged, not the structures that they inhabit.",
            "The mire of this issue thickens, a Gordian knot of conflicting sentiments. To address it, one must navigate the thin line between the sacred and the secular, the state and the church. Marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil union to others. Yet, is it not the latter, a bond between two individuals, that should be recognized by the government? The lines blur, and I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this debate. If marriage is a sacrament, then perhaps it should be left to the churches to define, lest the government meddles in the affairs of the divine. But if it is a civil union, then why not extend the same rights, the same privileges, to all who enter into such a bond, regardless of the manner in which they are joined?\n\nI do not pretend to have an answer, nor do I propose a solution. The issue seems too complex, too fraught with the potential for hurt and division. Yet, if we are to address it, we must do so with care and sensitivity. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? It seems a heavy-handed approach, one that disregards the nuance and complexity of this issue. The Constitution should not be amended for the whims of a minority, no matter how passionate their cause.\n\nAnd so, I stand at a remove, uncertain and unclear. The debate rages on, a maelstrom of opinion and emotion. I can only hope that, in the end, reason and compassion will prevail.",
            "In the shadow of my upbringing, a Christian home, I have come to regard the issue of homosexuality as a labyrinth of ambiguity. The lines that once seemed so clear have grown indistinct, like the outlines of a landscape shrouded in mist. My friendships with individuals who identify as gay have only served to muddle the waters further. I am torn between the certainties of my upbringing and the complexities of the world around me.\n\nThe question of legalization hangs in the balance, a pendulum swinging between the poles of acceptance and rejection. I do not subscribe to the notion that it should be a national issue, a matter for the president to dictate. Each state, with its unique character and values, should be free to chart its own course. The democratic states, with their liberal leanings, will likely champion the cause, while the more conservative states will resist. In such a scenario, it is the individual who chooses to reside in a given state who must abide by its laws and customs. I propose that we grant homosexuals the same rights and opportunities as their heterosexual counterparts, leaving the decision to legalize same-sex marriage to the discretion of each state.\n\nThe notion that the president should impose his will on the entire nation is a notion I find troubling. George Bush, for instance, has seen fit to ban gay marriage, but his authority extends only to the office he occupies. He does not reside in every state, and it is the people of each state who should decide how they wish to govern themselves. The president's tenure is fleeting, and with the passage of time, the pendulum will swing once more. It is the states, with their distinctive cultures and values, that must bear the weight of this decision, not the president.\n\nI do not condone the notion that the president should impose his will on the nation. In the end, it is the individual states that must live with the consequences of their decisions. I do not believe it is for the president to dictate how each state should govern itself.",
            "The notion of privacy in a world where the very fabric of the internet hangs like a gossamer thread for all to see is a tenuous thing. A public platform like Myspace, where one's thoughts and words are laid bare for the world to scrutinize, invites the gaze of others. The school officials, with their desire to safeguard the students, might see it as a necessary intrusion, a means to prevent the very horrors that have befallen places like Columbine. But does this not tread a fine line between protection and invasion?\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between public and private have grown increasingly blurred, it is a question of what we mean by 'public'. Is it not true that anything placed upon the internet is, in effect, a public declaration? And does this not give those who govern the right to intervene, to prevent the spread of ideas that might lead to harm? The notion that the internet is a sanctuary of sorts, a place where one can freely express oneself without consequence, is a myth. The digital trail we leave behind is a testament to our every thought, our every action.\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher of mine, a discussion about the measures taken to ensure the safety of the students. The lockdown drills, the protocols in place for instances of violence. It was a means to prepare for the worst, to prevent the unthinkable. And is this not what the school officials were attempting to do in this case? To prevent a tragedy, to safeguard the students? The line between invasion and protection is thin, and it is a line that we must continually reassess in this brave new world of ours.\n\nThe ease with which we can express ourselves online is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows us to convey our thoughts and feelings to a vast audience. On the other, it leaves us vulnerable to the prying eyes of others. We are our own worst enemies in this regard, our fears and doubts laid bare for all to see. And once something is posted online, it is there forever, a digital scar that cannot be erased.\n\nIt is a delicate balance we must strike, one that requires us to weigh the importance of freedom of expression against the need for protection. And it is a balance that will continue to shift, as the world around us evolves and adapts. But in the end, it is a question of what we value most: our right to express ourselves, or our right to be safe.",
            "In the blackened expanse of a mind still reeling from the aftershocks of a distant atrocity, the disquieting echoes of nine-eleven lingered like a miasma. A wound that refused to close, it festering and festering until it became an open sore that wept with every passing day. In its wake, a tide of emotion swept across the nation, a maelstrom of anger and fear that threatened to consume all in its path. And in the midst of this tempest, a decision was made to intervene, to insert ourselves into the crucible of a foreign land, to remake it in our own image. But the hubris of this endeavor was a siren's call, luring us into the treacherous waters of a conflict that would prove to be a quagmire, a quicksand that sucked in the unwary and spat out the broken.\n\nAt first, the zeal to act was a palpable thing, a fire that burned bright and hot, consuming all in its path. But as the embers of that initial fervor cooled, the outlines of a more nuanced reality began to emerge. The people we sought to save were not so easily saved, their struggles and triumphs a far cry from our own. War, for them, was a different beast, a savagery that knew no quarter, a endless cycle of violence and retaliation. And we, with our idealism and our hubris, had stumbled into this maelstrom unprepared, our plans a ragged and tattered thing, our motivations a mix of revenge and benevolence.\n\nIn the end, it was this lack of preparation, this failure to grasp the intricacies of a foreign land and its people, that would prove to be our undoing. We had gone in with a sense of superiority, of a civilizing force, but what we found was a complex tapestry of hatreds and resentments, a skein of rivalries and vendettas that we could not untangle. And so we became embroiled, our presence a constant thorn in the side of the very people we sought to help, our efforts to impose order and stability thwarted at every turn.\n\nNow, looking back, it is clear that we were mistaken, that our intervention was a folly, a well-intentioned but catastrophic mistake. We had thought to remake the world in our image, but what we created was a mess, a chaos of conflicting interests and unbridgeable divides. And so we must now extricate ourselves, withdraw from this quagmire, and let the people of that land find their own way. For we are not the ones to change them, to impose our will upon them. They are a people with their own history, their own culture, and their own destiny. And it is time for us to acknowledge this, to recognize the limits of our power, and to withdraw, humbled and chastened, from this foreign soil.\n\nBut the memories of that fateful day linger, a ghostly presence that haunts our collective psyche, a reminder of the perils of hubris and the dangers of intervention. And so we must learn from this, must recognize the limits of our power, and must strive to be more mindful in our actions, to think more carefully before we act, to consider the long-term consequences of our decisions. For in the end, it is not the mighty who shall inherit the earth, but the wise, the cautious, and the humble."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In a world beset by the rot of tradition, the Catholic Church stands as a testament to the unyielding grip of the past. Its views, once a guiding light in the darkness, now seem antiquated, a relic of a bygone era. The hemorrhage of followers, a slow and insidious bleed, threatens to consume the very fabric of the institution. The reasons for this decline are manifold, a tangled web of resistance to change and an unyielding adherence to dogma.\n\nThe Church's stance on matters of the human heart, the most intimate and private of concerns, has proven a barrier to those who would seek a more inclusive and compassionate path. The intolerance of gay marriage, the prohibition on abortion, the recalcitrant opposition to birth control – all have contributed to a sense of isolation, a feeling of being an outsider within one's own faith. The Church's views, once a source of comfort and guidance, now seem cold and unforgiving, a reminder of the distance between the hallowed halls of power and the humble, the marginalized, and the oppressed.\n\nIn an age of rapid transformation, the Church's inflexibility has become a liability, a liability that threatens to extinguish the flame of faith in the hearts of the faithful. The whisper of doubt, once a gentle breeze, has grown to a deafening roar, as the faithful question the relevance of an institution that seems more concerned with maintaining the status quo than with serving the needs of its people.\n\nThe call for reform, a quiet murmur at first, has grown to a cacophony of voices, a chorus of those who demand a more inclusive, more compassionate Church. The ordination of women, the marriage of priests – these are not revolutionary ideas, but rather a return to the sensibilities of a bygone era, a time when the Church was not afraid to adapt, to evolve, and to grow. The notion that priests are \"married\" to God, that their devotion is a singular, all-consuming passion, is a romantic notion, one that ignores the fundamental human need for connection, for love, and for community.\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between the sacred and the secular are increasingly blurred, the Catholic Church finds itself struggling to maintain its relevance. Its views, once a beacon of hope, now seem a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of the dangers of dogma, of the perils of an institution that prioritizes doctrine over compassion, tradition over innovation.\n\nAs the faithful continue to question, to doubt, and to seek, the Church must confront the mirror of its own reflection, must confront the possibility that its views, its traditions, and its very way of life may be irreparably damaged. The choice is clear: adapt, evolve, and grow, or risk being consumed by the very darkness it once sought to illuminate.",
            "In the desolate expanse of my thought, a notion stirs, a notion that I've come to regard with a certain measure of conviction. The idea that two individuals of the same sex should be denied the right to partake in the sacrament of marriage, that they should be prohibited from committing to one another, strikes me as a void in the fabric of our existence. It is a chasm, a crevice that yawns open, revealing the brutal indifference of the universe. I do not believe, nor can I fathom, that a person's innate orientation is a decision forged in the crucible of choice, but rather a sacred geometry that shapes their essence.\n\nTo hold them accountable for what they are, to condemn them for the contours of their being, is a folly of unyielding cruelty. It is a condemnation that says more about us, about our own frailties and fears, than it does about the individuals we seek to condemn. We are wont to say that we are born straight, that our inclinations are a given, an immutable truth. And yet, we deny this fundamental truth to those whose inclinations differ from our own. It is a hypocrisy, a flagrant display of our own self-interest.\n\nI do not pretend to possess a profound understanding of the issue, nor do I claim to be immune to the tumult of my own emotions. However, I do know this: the federal government has no business in the innermost recesses of our lives, no right to dictate the nature of our relationships. It is a matter of personal liberty, a fundamental human right that should be safeguarded, not infringed upon. We must not permit the state to sully the sanctity of love, to reduce the most intimate bonds between two individuals to a mere abstraction, a legal nicety.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of morality, nor is it a question of national security. It is a question of basic humanity. We are not gods, nor are we the arbiters of what constitutes a just and moral society. We are but fleeting, fragile creatures, stumbling through the darkness, seeking connection, seeking solace in the face of an uncaring universe. To deny another their fundamental right to love, to be loved, is to surrender to the void, to acquiesce to the brutal indifference that lies at the heart of existence.\n\nAnd so, I stand firm in my conviction, a conviction born of a deep-seated empathy, a recognition of the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of their orientation. It is a conviction that I hold dear, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of compassion. And I will not falter, for in the end, it is not I who will be judged, but the universe itself, for its capacity to create and destroy, to bring forth life and snuff out the flame of hope.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a world beset by the whims of others, there exists a notion that has come to plague our collective conscience - the legalization of gay marriage. A union that defies the conventional norms, a bond that transcends the boundaries of societal expectations. And yet, it is this very notion that has sparked a fire of fervent debate, a maelstrom of opinions that threaten to consume us all.\n\nBut let us not be swayed by the tempests of fear and ignorance. Let us instead seek to understand the essence of this issue, to peel away the layers of misconception and reveal the truth that lies beneath. For it is in the quiet moments of introspection, when the din of the world fades into the background, that we may come to realize the inherent equality of all human relationships.\n\nThe notion that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family is a specious one, a canard born of prejudice and fear. For what is a family, truly, but a union of two individuals bound together by love and commitment? Is it not the same bond that exists between two people of the same sex, a bond that is strengthened by the trials and tribulations of life? The idea that such a bond is somehow less valid, less worthy of recognition, is a notion that defies the very fabric of our humanity.\n\nAnd yet, it is this notion of recognition that has become a central tenet of the debate. The struggle for gay marriage is not about the right to be married in a church, but about the right to be recognized by the state, to have one's relationship validated by the very institution that governs our society. It is a matter of civil rights, of equality under the law.\n\nBut equality, it seems, is a concept that is fraught with peril. For in a world where some are bound by the strictures of tradition and faith, the idea of equality can be seen as a threat, a challenge to the status quo. And so, we are met with the specter of opposition, the argument that gay marriage is somehow morally wrong, that it goes against the teachings of certain religious groups.\n\nBut what of the morality of the majority? Is it not hypocritical to impose one's own moral code on others, to create laws that enforce a particular set of values on an entire country? Is it not the duty of government to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation? The controversy over the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance is a telling example of this very issue, a reminder that our government has a long history of reconciling the competing interests of different groups.\n\nAnd yet, despite the progress we have made, there remain those who cling to outdated notions of morality, who see gay people as somehow damaged or defective. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against these claims, citing the overwhelming evidence that contradicts them. But still, the voices of ignorance and fear persist, a reminder that our journey towards equality is far from over.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of morality, but of humanity. It is not a question of what is right or wrong, but of what is just. And so, let us strive to see the world in a different light, to recognize the inherent value of all human relationships, regardless of their orientation. Let us strive to create a world where all are equal, where all are valued and respected. For in the end, it is not the laws that we pass, but the love that we share, that will truly set us free.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy, I stood as a summer's sentinel, a guardian of pills and potions. The proscription of certain substances, I've come to realize, does not necessarily negate their utility. There are remedies, after all, that the law deems illicit yet prove invaluable in the realm of healing. Oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets - all these and more, though contraband, are sanctioned for their efficacy. And yet, when it comes to the verdant leaf, the stigmatic label of illegality seems to render its virtues moot.\n\nBut is it not paradoxical that we valorize certain poisons while condemning a plant whose benefits we've yet to fully grasp? A weed, some might say, whose allure lies in its illegitimacy. Yet, I propose we shed the shroud of taboo that shrouds it, that we might uncover its true nature. The fact remains that it holds within it potential - a potential to heal, to soothe, to bring solace to the afflicted.\n\nIts potency, like that of alcohol, can be abused. But does this render it an object of revulsion? No, for it is the manner of consumption that must be considered, not the substance itself. Gradual integration, perhaps, could be the key. A measured approach, one that acknowledges the plant's potential while safeguarding against its misuse.\n\nWe've been conditioned to view it as a pariah, a substance to be feared and maligned. The truth, however, lies in the middle ground - a realm where its beneficial properties can be harnessed, where its use is guided by reason and restraint. Only then can we begin to grasp the true essence of the leaf, to see it for what it is: a tool, a key to unlocking the secrets of the human body.\n\nIn this, I see a glimmer of hope. A chance to redeem the tarnished reputation of an herb whose virtues have been obscured by the shadows of misconception.",
            "In this changed world, where the hallowed halls of the church now ring with the faint whispers of progress, I find myself a stranger, wandering through the shadows of a once-familiar place. The church, a bastion of tradition, has adapted to the rhythms of the twenty-first century, its stern visage softened by the gentle winds of time. Gone are the days of rigid adherence, of Sunday finery and matching accessories; now, the pews are filled with the casual attire of a more modern era. The sacred rituals, too, have been streamlined, reduced to a mere thirty minutes of devotional time. In the summer, parishioners arrive from the beach, their beachwear a testament to the church's newfound informality. Even the morning masses, once a bastion of formal elegance, now see the faithful dressed in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the somber attire of yesteryear.\n\nAs I navigate this new landscape, I am struck by the superficial changes that have taken place. The church, once a fortress of orthodoxy, now seems to have lost some of its rigor. The politics, the intrigue, the shadowy machinations that once lurked in the recesses of the church's halls – all these remain shrouded in mystery. But one thing is certain: the institution has evolved, its traditions yielding to the tides of time.\n\nRegarding the scourge of pedophilia that has besmirched the good name of the Catholic Church, I must confess that I do not believe that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these heinous crimes. The affliction of pedophilia is a twisted aspect of human nature, one that cannot be legislated away or rectified by changes in the church's dogma. Men, even those bound by vows of chastity, can still succumb to their baser impulses. The relative handful of faiths that permit their clergy to marry have not eliminated the problem; rather, they have simply pushed it into the shadows, where it festers unseen.\n\nIn my view, the notion that the church could have prevented these atrocities by altering its rules is a naive one. Pedophilia is a manifestation of a deeper, more primal force – one that is rooted in the very fabric of human nature. It is a beast that cannot be tamed by the church's laws or dogma. If the institution had been aware of these abuses and chose to cover them up, then shame indeed be upon it. But to assume that a change in the church's policies would have eradicated the problem is to misunderstand the fundamental nature of humanity.\n\nAs I reflect on the Catholic Church, I am left with a sense of melancholy, a feeling that the institution, once a beacon of hope and faith, has been tarnished by the very darkness it sought to vanquish. Yet, even in the face of these failings, I remain hopeful that the church will one day rediscover its moral compass, and that it will emerge, phoenix-like, from the ashes of its own failure.",
            "In the charred and barren expanse of the American psyche, a festering wound had been opened by the twin scythes of deception and bloodlust. The September 11th attacks, a crucible of pain and terror, had been seized upon by those who would wield the power of the state like a scimitar, slicing through the Constitution and the very fabric of truth. The Bush administration, with its hubris and mendacity, had woven a tapestry of lies, connecting Saddam Hussein to the terror of that dread day, a threadbare pretext for the invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe Bush administration's hand had been heavy with malice, crushing the truth beneath its heel, even as Colin Powell, that erstwhile champion of the lie, now confessed to a lack of conviction in the evidence he presented to the UN. The stench of malfeasance hung in the air, an impeachable offense that had yet to be acknowledged.\n\nThe Constitution, that sacred document, had been repeatedly defiled, trampled beneath the feet of those who would seek to control the narrative, to shape the discourse, and to bend the will of the people to their whim. Since September 11th, the Bush administration had operated with a clear intent to subjugate the Constitution, to reduce it to a mere parchment, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe seeds of war had been sown in the fertile soil of vengeance, the younger Bush's hunger for blood a palpable force, driven by a desire to avenge his father's failures. The true motives, hidden behind a veneer of concern for national security, had been to secure the country's energy interests, a cynical calculus that had been played out in the blood-soaked streets of Iraq.\n\nThe war had dragged on, a cancer that refused to be excised, a festering wound that had claimed countless lives and destroyed the lives of countless more. The instability in the region threatened to boil over, a maelstrom of sectarian violence and tribal strife that had consumed the country.\n\nThe proposed solution, a coalition of surrounding nations, seemed a pale imitation of a remedy, a patchwork solution that would only serve to perpetuate the cycle of violence. The sovereignty of Iraq, a concept that had been so cavalierly disregarded by the occupiers, would continue to be eroded, a slow-motion train wreck that threatened to consume all in its path.\n\nThe Parliament, a puppet regime propped up by foreign powers, struggled to assert its authority, a rudderless ship adrift in a sea of chaos. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, wielded little actual power, as the radical elements of the country continued to vie for control, their machinations a deadly dance of politics and violence.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of this maelstrom, a glimmer of truth remained, a faint flame that flickered in the darkness, a reminder that the people had been lied to, that their trust had been betrayed, and that the truth, though obscured, would eventually emerge, a blazing fire that would consume the perpetrators of this great injustice.",
            "He spoke in halting cadence, as if the words themselves were weights he struggled to lift. The question hung in the air like a challenge, unmet and unspoken. He searched for a foothold, a crumb of certainty to cling to in the dark chasm of his thoughts.\n\nThe War in Iraq. A name that clung to his tongue like a bitter taste. He didn't know where to begin. The threads of his thoughts tangled, knotted, and twisted like the charred remains of a burned forest.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. \"It seems pointless, a hollow drumbeat in the desert wasteland. A war without purpose, without end. We stumbled into it, like a blind man into a ravine, and now we're stuck, mired in the mud of our own making.\"\n\nHe paused, the silence a heavy mist that closed in around him. \"It's a game of shadows, a dance of smoke and mirrors. We're trying to impose our will on a culture, to shape it in our image, but it's like trying to carve a sculpture from sand. It's a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, the words spilling forth like a confession. \"I don't know what the future holds, but I fear we're digging our own grave, a grave of ash and dust and deceit. We're trying to build a democracy, but it's a house of cards, a fragile structure that will crumble beneath the weight of our own hubris.\"\n\nHe fell silent, the words dying on his lips like autumn leaves on a winter breeze. \"I don't know what to think,\" he said finally, his voice a whisper in the void. \"I'm lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty. All I know is that we're stuck, trapped in this endless cycle of violence and bloodshed, and I don't know how to escape.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was heavy, a weight that pressed down upon him like a physical force. He knew he was lost, adrift in a world gone mad, and he feared he might never find his way back to the shore.",
            "The notion of a state imposing its will upon the sacred rituals of the faithful seemed an affront to the fundamental principles of our constitution. The separation of church and state was a cornerstone of our nation's edifice, a bulwark against the tyranny of dogma and the imposition of one creed over another. The constitution itself was replete with the language of liberty, of freedom from the shackles of coercive authority. To tamper with this delicate balance would be to invite a darkness that would soon consume us all.\n\nIn the struggle to define the boundaries of a free people, the churches themselves must be the arbiters of their own destiny. To seek to impose a single interpretation upon the faithful, to dictate the sacred rites and rituals of the marginalized and the minority, was to flout the very principles of religious tolerance that had brought our nation to its knees. The federal government, with its heavy hand and its vainglorious ambitions, must not be allowed to usurp the authority of the churches. It was a prospect too dire, too fraught with peril, to contemplate.\n\nThe framers of our constitution had been wise in their foresight, in their crafting of a document that would safeguard the rights of all, regardless of creed or persuasion. The separation of church and state was not a mere abstraction, a dusty relic of a bygone era, but a living, breathing principle, a bulwark against the ravages of intolerance and oppression. To tamper with this delicate balance would be to invite the very darkness that we sought to vanquish.\n\nThe push for an amendment, driven by personal conviction and a zealot's fervor, was a misguided endeavor, a bitter fruit of the tree of dogma. It was a testament to the dangers of unchecked power, of the corrupting influence that lurked within the hearts of those who would seek to impose their will upon the faithful. The economy, the society, the very fabric of our nation – all would suffer, were we to allow this aberrant power to take hold.\n\nIn the end, it was not the government's role to dictate the sacred rituals of the faithful, but rather to protect the freedom of conscience, to safeguard the delicate balance of power that had been entrusted to us by our forebears. The churches must be left to their own devices, to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. For it was in this fragile dance of power, this delicate balance of freedom and authority, that our nation found its strength, its beauty, and its very soul.",
            "In the desolate landscape of modern politics, the war in Iraq stands as a stark reminder of the hubris of power and the fallibility of human judgment. The government's actions, shrouded in a veil of secrecy and deception, left the American people with a nagging sense of doubt and disillusionment. The invasion, launched in 2003, was predicated on a fragile link between the events of September 11th and the supposed threat posed by Iraq's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, a connection that was tenuous at best.\n\nThe echoes of the Vietnam War seemed to reverberate through the corridors of power, as the US government, blinded by the ghosts of the past, repeated the same mistakes. The war, a protracted and bloody endeavor, claimed countless American lives, its true cost shrouded in the mists of time. The void left by the ousting of the Iraqi government was a chasm of chaos and anarchy, a testament to the government's woeful lack of preparation for the aftermath.\n\nThe notion of implanting democracy in a foreign land, a concept as elusive as the wind, was an endeavor doomed from the start. The parallels with Vietnam were stark: the push for democracy, the removal of a perceived enemy, and the subsequent quagmire of insurgency. The US government, seemingly oblivious to the lessons of history, plunged headlong into the abyss, leaving in its wake a trail of death and destruction.\n\nThe US government's actions, a labyrinth of deceit and manipulation, left the American people with a sense of unease and mistrust. The smoke and mirrors of propaganda, designed to conceal the true nature of the war, only served to fan the flames of dissent and opposition. The war, a Sisyphean task, seemed to drag on interminably, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and sacrifice.\n\nAs the years ticked by, the toll mounted, the lives lost, the futures shattered. The Iraqi people, innocent bystanders in a conflict not of their making, were left to pick up the pieces, to rebuild their shattered lives in a landscape scarred by the ravages of war. The US government, a behemoth of power, seemed deaf to the cries of the victims, its priorities driven by a singular focus on oil and resources.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a legacy of blood and tears, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of humility in the face of the unknown. As the years passed, the rhetoric of the war machine gave way to the cold, harsh reality of its consequences, a reality that would haunt the nation for generations to come.\n\nIn the silence of the night, as the shadows dance upon the wall, one cannot help but wonder: what lies at the heart of this war? Is it a quest for freedom, or a quest for power? The answer, shrouded in the mists of time, remains a mystery, a riddle waiting to be solved.\n\nAnd so, we are left to ponder the question: what is the true cost of war? Is it the lives lost, the families shattered, the futures destroyed? Or is it something more sinister, a cancer that eats away at the very fabric of our society? The war in Iraq, a scar upon the face of history, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of wisdom in the face of uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it is not the war that will be remembered, but the lives that were lost, the dreams that were shattered, and the hope that was extinguished. The war in Iraq, a legacy of blood and tears, will forever be etched in the annals of history as a cautionary tale of the dangers of hubris and the importance of humility in the face of the unknown.",
            "I stumble upon the precipice of this argument, unsure of the footing. The notion of gay marriage, a canvas of conviction held taut by the threads of personal preference. The understanding that human inclination can be a force beyond our control, a biological whisper that echoes through the chambers of our being. To deny this fundamental aspect of our nature, to curtail the rights of those who are bound by the currents of their own desire, is an affront to the very essence of humanity.\n\nIn the depths of our society, there exist pockets of acceptance, of love and companionship that defy the constraints of societal norms. My own neighborhood, a microcosm of the world, is home to couples who walk among us, their love and devotion as palpable as the morning dew. They are not strangers to the quiet routines of domesticity, their dogs walked, their children raised, their lives woven into the fabric of our community.\n\nAnd yet, the forces of oppression seek to impose their will, to rewrite the script of marriage to suit their own narrow vision. The notion that the state, that the church, should dictate the terms of our most intimate relationships, is a travesty. Marriage, a sacrament of love and commitment, should not be subject to the whims of politicians and theologians.\n\nThe science is clear: the very fabric of our being is shaped by the intricate dance of biology and environment. The notion that homosexuality is a choice, a moral failing, is a relic of a bygone era. The evidence is mounting, a chorus of voices that attest to the fundamental humanity of those who are drawn to their own kind.\n\nAnd so, I stand in solidarity with those who would seek to claim their rights, to assert their love and commitment in the face of adversity. Marriage, a union of two souls, should be a private, personal affair, not a public spectacle subject to the whims of the powerful. It is a matter of basic human dignity, a fundamental right that should not be denied.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of politics, but of humanity. A recognition of our shared existence, our capacity for love and compassion. The denial of gay marriage is not just a blow to the rights of a minority, but a affront to the very fabric of our society. It is a reminder that we are not yet the society we claim to be, a society that values freedom, equality, and the pursuit of happiness.",
            "The perils of a world without bounds. When you cast your thoughts into the void, you invite the uninvited to bear witness. The internet, that great and unforgiving expanse, holds all in its gaze. A public forum, a clearing of unspoken truths, where the weight of words can be measured in the hearts of those who read them. As one who has walked the crucible of such a world, I speak from experience. The things you set free into the ether, they do not remain the property of the one who set them free. They are sown, like seeds in the rain, and take root in the minds of others.\n\nIn this wild and uncharted sea, the lines of private and public blur, and the notion of control is but a distant memory. The world is a stranger's gaze, and what you wish to keep hidden, it will find. The example of the school, where whispers in a crowded hallway became a clarion call for caution, serves as a stark reminder of this truth. The internet, that great sieve, filters not for the benefit of the one who casts their words into its depths, but for the benefit of those who would claim dominion over the narrative.\n\nThe boundaries we once knew, the walls that once separated us, are breached. The notion of privacy, that sacred trust, is but a relic of a bygone era. When you put your thoughts into the world, you unleash a force beyond your control. The school officials, those custodians of order, may not have the luxury of cherry-picking what they choose to heed, for the whispers of the internet can be a call to action, a clarion that cannot be ignored.\n\nAnd yet, there is a fine line between prudence and overreach. The teacher who dons a false persona, a mask of anonymity, to peer into the private lives of their students, crosses that line. The same holds true for the residential advisor, who would rather not know the secrets that their charges choose to share in the digital wilderness. The world is a complex tapestry, woven from the threads of our choices, and the internet is but one of its many facets.\n\nIn this vast and bewildering landscape, we must navigate the shoals of our own making. What we put out into the world, it will return to us, like a tide that cannot be stemmed. The only question is, what do we wish to create? The world is a canvas, and our words are the brushstrokes that paint its hue. Let us choose our colors wisely.",
            "The conflagration of war had been a slow burn, consuming all in its path. Its purpose, once a beacon of hope, had long since dwindled to a smoldering ember. We had begun with noble intentions, a crusade to restore democracy to a land shrouded in tyranny. But the flames of our conviction had grown cold, our passion reduced to a mere spark.\n\nThe original spark had been lit by the desire to vanquish a despot, to bring freedom to a people oppressed. Yet, as the fire raged on, our motivations had grown muddled. We had lost sight of the high purpose that had driven us forward, and in its place, a sense of pride and power had taken hold. We fought not for the sake of a higher good, but to prove our own strength, to assert our dominance over the world.\n\nThe ghosts of George Bush's past animosities with Saddam Hussein still lingered, a specter that haunted our decision-making. Had we ever truly been driven by a desire to bring democracy to the people, or had we been swayed by personal vendettas? The flame of our conviction had been tarnished by the weight of our own self-interest.\n\nWe had made our statement in the early days of the conflict, a bold declaration of our intent. But the war had dragged on, a seemingly endless and futile struggle. Year after year, we continued to pour our treasure into a bottomless pit, a drain on our economy and our people. We should have known when to stop, when to acknowledge that our purpose had been lost, and that it was time to let the people of the affected nation fend for themselves.\n\nThe dollars we spent on war could have been better spent on the pressing issues of our own country: poverty, education, healthcare, and the infrastructure that underpins our very way of life. We had been blinded by our own hubris, our desire to assert our dominance clouding our judgment. The war had become a self-perpetuating machine, driven by a desire to prove that we would not be defeated, rather than a genuine desire to bring about positive change.\n\nThe people of our nation were being killed, wounded, and maimed in a conflict that had long since lost its justification. The money we spent on this war could have been better spent on the very issues that plague our own society. It was a reckless extravagance, a squandering of our resources on a lost cause.\n\nAs I see it, the war has been a dismal failure, a tragic exercise in futility. It is time for us to acknowledge this, to recognize that our purpose has been lost, and that it is time to bring our troops home.",
            "The notion of privacy in this brave new world of ours, where the boundaries between the self and the void are increasingly blurred. It's a conundrum, really. We surrender our secrets to the void, hoping to connect with others, only to find ourselves exposed, vulnerable, and at the mercy of those who would seek to do us harm. The internet, a vast and unforgiving expanse, stretches out before us like a desolate wasteland, waiting to swallow our every thought, our every move.\n\nConsider the case of Myspace, that erstwhile bastion of teenage angst and social posturing. If one posts information on such a site, are they not tacitly inviting the world to peer into their innermost recesses? The notion of \"friends\" and \"friends of friends\" is a farce, a mere facade that conceals the true nature of this digital free-for-all. We give permission, willingly or not, for others to see into our lives, to snoop and pry, to form judgments about us based on the most superficial of criteria.\n\nAnd yet, what of the case where someone, driven by a desire to do good, stumbles upon a profile that may potentially prevent a life from being lost? Is it not a cruel fate to deny them the means to act, to intervene, or to prevent a tragedy? But, on the other hand, is it not also a slippery slope, a Pandora's box that, once opened, cannot be closed? We must tread carefully, lest we invite an era of digital surveillance, where the State, or some individual driven by a zealot's fervor, seeks to monitor and control every aspect of our lives.\n\nThe lines are blurred, and the issue is complex. We must acknowledge that, in this digital age, we are never truly alone, that our every move is potentially being watched, monitored, and judged. And yet, we must also recognize that there is a fine line between prudence and paranoia, between a desire to connect and a need to protect ourselves. The world is a vast and messy place, and we must navigate its complexities with care.\n\nAs I sit here, pondering this digital labyrinth, I am reminded of the words of a sage who once said, \"The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.\" But what of those who do travel, who wander the vast expanse of the internet, never truly knowing who is watching, who is waiting, or who will act? We are all of us, in this brave new world, both hunter and hunted, prey and predator, our fates intertwined with the fates of others in ways we cannot fully comprehend.",
            "The weight of the world's duplicity bore down upon him like a shroud, a somber reminder of the futility that had befallen the Iraq War. He hesitated, his words faltering on the precipice of conviction, as he struggled to reconcile his own ambivalence. It was a hypocrisy he couldn't shake, a feeling that had taken root in the desolate landscape of his conscience. \n\nHe thought back to the early days, when the war was still a distant hum in the collective unconscious, a murmur of discontent that threatened to boil over into a fevered pitch of outrage. But now, as the years had worn on like a shroud of ash, it was clear that the war had been a catastrophe from the start. The numbers were stark: 75 to 80 percent of the global population, 80 percent of Iraqis, 70 percent of the troops on the ground – all believed it was a bad idea. A disaster that had unfolded like a dark tapestry, its threads of deceit and hubris inextricably intertwined.\n\nThe administration's obstinacy was a constant reminder of the chasm that yawned between their vision and the harsh realities of the Middle East. They had sought to impose their will upon a region that refused to be shaped by their ideals. The clash of cultures was a gulf too wide to bridge, a chasm that had swallowed countless dreams of democracy and left only rubble in its wake.\n\nHe thought of Saddam, a fallen tyrant, and wondered if the ends had justified the means. Had the invasion been worth the cost in blood and treasure? The question hung in the air like a specter, its answer as elusive as the shifting sands of the desert. \n\nHe couldn't help but feel that the administration's persistence was a form of madness, a refusal to acknowledge the truth that had been apparent from the start. The problems of withdrawal were real, but so were the problems of staying. And yet, as he weighed the pros and cons, he couldn't find a compelling reason to justify the continued occupation.\n\nIn the end, it came down to a simple truth: the Iraqi people had spoken, and their voices were clear. They wanted the United States to leave, to extricate itself from the quagmire of its own making. If the administration couldn't hear their pleas, then perhaps it was time to take a step back and listen to the whispers of history. For in the end, it was the Iraqi people who would inherit the consequences of this war, and it was their voices that should be heard above the din of justification and rationalization.\n\nHe fell silent, his words spent, his thoughts trailing off into the desert wind like the ashes of a forgotten city. The Iraq War was a reminder that sometimes, even the most well-intentioned actions can unleash a maelstrom of chaos and destruction. And sometimes, the only way to begin the process of healing is to acknowledge the mistakes of the past, and to let go of the weight of our own hubris.",
            "In the wasteland of societal norms, a glass ceiling still hangs, shrouding the dreams of women. It is a barrier that has long been a part of our collective unconscious, a stain that refuses to fade. Though we have made strides, though we have come a long way, the struggle persists. The weight of history bears down upon us, a crushing force that seeks to keep women in their place. And yet, it is not just women who suffer. Men too are bound by the chains of expectation, forced to conform to roles that are predetermined by a society that values productivity over humanity.\n\nIn the fields of work, a man's worth is often measured by his ability to provide, to be the breadwinner. And so, when a man chooses to stay at home, to tend to his children and nurture his family, he is met with scorn and suspicion. \"Why are you not working?\" the question hangs in the air, a judgment that seeks to pierce the soul. And in the fashion industry, where aesthetics reign supreme, a man's seriousness is often called into question. Can he truly understand the nuances of fashion, or is he simply a poseur, a man playing at being something he is not?\n\nWe are a society in flux, slowly shedding the skin of our prejudices, but the process is glacial. It is a battle that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to confront the darkness within ourselves. We must acknowledge the glass ceiling, the walls that divide us, and work to shatter them. We must promote the qualities that make us human, that make us worthy of respect, regardless of our gender or background. But we must do so with subtlety, with a light touch, lest we provoke resistance and reinforce the very prejudices we seek to overcome.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, a dance between progress and pushback. And yet, I believe we are at a turning point, a moment when the tide is shifting in our favor. Women are rising to positions of power, their voices being heard, their stories being told. And men, too, are beginning to question the status quo, to challenge the expectations that have been placed upon them. It is a slow process, but it is one that will ultimately lead to a more just and equitable society, one where all individuals are free to be themselves, without fear of judgment or reprisal.",
            "The world had changed its laws, yet nothing had changed. They'd decriminalized it, but that was not the same as making it right. It was a distinction without a difference, a nuance lost on the wind. The law still weighed heavy, its chains still binding, though now they were forged of paper and ink rather than iron and steel. A ticket now, rather than a cell, the punishment for those who dared to transgress. But the consequences lingered, like the stench of a rotting carcass, long after the initial blow had been struck.\n\nThe future, a minefield of uncertainty, where one wrong step could lead to ruin. The whispers of the past, echoes of a lifetime's mistakes, still lingered, a constant reminder of the perils of indulgence. And yet, the argument of expediency held weight - the cost of incarceration, the drain on resources, the weight of bureaucracy, all these things whispered sweet nothings in the ears of those who would cut corners.\n\nBut in a place like Denver, where the winds of change blew strong, where the people were open and liberal in their thinking, the law had been rewritten, and the city had reaped the benefits. Money freed from the shackles of prohibition had flowed into the streets, into the schools, into the hands of those who needed it most. The homeless, the elderly, all had benefited from the new order.\n\nAnd yet, as with all things, there were those who saw the darkness beneath the surface. The idea of a society where marijuana was as ubiquitous as cigarettes, where its use was as casual as a drink on a Friday night, was a prospect that filled them with unease. The taboo had been broken, but the fear remained, a lingering sense of unease that lingered long after the law had been rewritten.\n\nBut the truth was, no two people reacted the same to the substance, just as no two people reacted the same to the world around them. Some were torn apart, their minds shattered by the experience, while others were barely touched. And so, the debate raged on, a never-ending cycle of argument and counter-argument, as humanity struggled to understand the nature of the beast they had unleashed.\n\nIn the end, it was not the law that mattered, but the individual, and how they chose to wield their own power. Moderation, excess, the line between was a thin one, a knife's edge that separated the wise from the foolhardy. And so, the debate continued, a never-ending struggle to understand the nature of the world, and our place within it.",
            "I'd say yes. It's a case of tradition's wearied hand guiding their steps. They move through the days in a manner that's been practiced for an eternity - the same rituals, the same routines. And in that repetition lies a certain comfort, a sense of rootedness in a world that's grown increasingly foreign. But alongside this adherence to tradition must come a willingness to bend with the winds of change. For in its rigidity, the Church can be a heavy chain that binds, stifling the very spirit it seeks to nourish.\n\nI think of my own experiences with this dichotomy. My parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian respectively, were never wed in the Catholic Church due to my father's faith. It was a decision that left a bitter taste in my mouth, and one that I couldn't shake the feeling was a affront to the very principle of love and acceptance that the Church espouses. Why, if we're to love one another unconditionally, must we turn away from those who don't conform to our narrow creed? It's a paradox that has long plagued me, and one that I fear is inherent in the Church's very fabric.\n\nAnd yet, I'm not convinced that the institution would be fundamentally changed by allowing priests to marry. The rot of pedophilia runs deep, a cancer that's impossible to excise with a simple reform. The act of marriage, or the lack thereof, is a mere symptom of a far greater malaise. If a man is consumed by his baser impulses, he'll find a way to act upon them, regardless of his station. It's a truth that's both grim and inescapable.\n\nNo, I fear that the true issue lies not in the rules and regulations, but in the hearts of those who would seek to do harm. And it's a darkness that will not be vanquished by grand gestures or sweeping reforms.",
            "I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this issue, uncertain of the path to follow. The lines blur between the separation of church and state, the definition of marriage a snare that ensnares all who dare to tread. It is a minefield of opposing views, each side a jagged rock waiting to rend the unwary.\n\nIt is a topic of darkness, a void that yawns wide, drawing in the unwary with its siren song of simplicity. Marriage, a sacrament of the heart, a bond between two souls, or is it merely a civil union, a contract forged in the cold fire of state and law? The government, a behemoth that brooks no dissent, seeks to stamp its seal upon the union, to bestow its blessings, or damn its curse.\n\nI dare not take a stance, lest I be seen as a heretic, a blasphemer, or a saint. For in this wilderness of competing claims, I find no clear path to follow. The church and state, two titans locked in eternal combat, each seeking to impose its will upon the other. The constitution, a sacred text, a document of freedom, or a framework for tyranny? A constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, a clarion call to arms, or a mere expedient, a tool of the powerful?\n\nI am but a traveler in this desert, a wanderer in the void, lost and alone. I know not which path to take, nor which side to choose. The issue of gay marriage, a mere symptom of the larger disease, a cancer that infects our society, a plague that gnaws at the very fabric of our being.\n\nLet the states, those bastions of freedom, those citadels of liberty, come to a consensus, a logical conclusion, a decision born of reason and compassion. Let them forge a path, a beacon of hope, a shining light in the darkness. But let us not amend the constitution, that sacred text, that document of our highest aspirations, to ban a union that is but a mere shadow of the love and commitment that it represents.\n\nNo, let us not be swayed by the passions of the moment, let us not be led astray by the siren song of ideology. Let us seek the truth, the wisdom, the compassion that lies at the heart of this issue. For in the end, it is not about the constitution, nor the church, nor the state. It is about the human heart, that vast and mysterious organ, that beating drum of love and compassion that pulses through us all.",
            "In the void of conviction, I find myself lost between the certainties of my upbringing and the complexities of the world around me. Raised in a home steeped in Christian tradition, I've struggled to reconcile the beauty of love with the strictures of doctrine. Gay relationships, for me, have always been a nuanced and multifaceted issue, one that defies easy categorization. My friendships with individuals from the LGBTQ+ community have only deepened this sentiment, forcing me to confront the gray areas that exist between faith and acceptance.\n\nLike many, I've come to believe that gay marriage should be a matter for individual states to decide. The notion of a centralized authority dictating the terms of love and commitment seems antithetical to the principles of democracy. The diversity of our nation, with its mix of red and blue states, only underscores the need for local decision-making on this issue.\n\nIn democratic states, where the majority has spoken on the matter, it seems reasonable to respect their will. However, this does not preclude the right of other states to chart their own course. Why should the president, who may not reside in these states, impose his will upon them? It is the people, not the executive branch, who should decide the fate of gay marriage in their communities.\n\nI firmly believe that individuals from the LGBTQ+ community deserve the same opportunities and rights as their heterosexual counterparts. To deny them this is to perpetuate a system of inequality. By allowing each state to decide for itself, we empower local leaders to create a more inclusive and just society.\n\nIn this context, the role of the president becomes increasingly irrelevant. The ban on gay marriage, imposed by President Bush, seems an outdated and misguided policy. As the country moves forward, it is the people, not the executive branch, who will ultimately determine the course of history. By granting states the autonomy to decide on gay marriage, we ensure that the will of the people is respected and that love knows no bounds.\n\nUltimately, my position on this issue is guided by a desire for inclusivity and a recognition of the complexities that surround us. By embracing the gray areas, rather than trying to impose simplistic solutions, we can create a more just and compassionate society for all.",
            "The notion that one's words are their own to wield has long been a fleeting deception. The unforgiving vastness of the digital sphere has stripped us of our most intimate thoughts, rendering them public property. Myspace, a platform born of the same impulse to connect, has become a repository of our most private selves. The lines between public and private have grown indistinct, with consequences that are both far-reaching and inescapable.\n\nIf one posts their thoughts on the internet, they must reckon with the certainty that others will see them. School officials, with their authority to monitor and moderate, are no exception. They may not have been directly privy to the school's name, but the internet's labyrinthine pathways allow them to uncover secrets hidden behind the façade of anonymity. In the pursuit of a safer school environment, their actions, though invasive, may be justified. By tracking students' online activities, they aim to prevent the very real threat of harm – a threat that has manifested all too horribly in the annals of history.\n\nThe school's stance, though seemingly an invasion of privacy, is also a harbinger of a larger truth: our individual words and actions have consequences that reverberate long after they are spoken. The permanence of the internet ensures that our mistakes will be remembered, that they will haunt us like specters in the darkness. It is a sobering reality, one that we would do well to acknowledge. For in the face of such power, our words and actions are not our own, but a public trust.\n\nThe teacher, a guardian of sorts, had once spoken to me of the importance of safety protocols in schools. Lockdown drills, designed to prepare for the unthinkable, had become a regular occurrence. Though the threat of terrorism loomed large, it was the specter of violence within their own walls that the school officials sought to vanquish. Preventing a Columbine-like tragedy, they had implemented measures to safeguard their students. And in doing so, they had, in effect, acted as the custodians of their students' safety.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance we must strike. On one hand, the school's actions may be seen as an invasion of privacy. On the other, they may be viewed as a necessary measure to ensure the well-being of their students. As we navigate this gray area, we must remember that our words, once spoken, take on a life of their own, a life that can never be fully undone.",
            "The echoes of that day still linger, a miasma of emotion and anger that clung to the skin like a damp shroud. I was young, naive, and lost in the haze of a world that seemed to have been turned upside down. Nine eleven had left its mark, a scar that would never fully heal. I was swept up in the fervor, the blind desire for vengeance and retribution that seemed to course through the veins of a nation. We were a people bent on destruction, our hearts consumed by a fire that would soon engulf us all.\n\nWe marched into the unknown, unprepared and without a plan, driven by a sense of righteous indignation that would prove to be our undoing. The war, a messy and complicated beast, devoured us whole. We entered with a promise of order and freedom, but instead found ourselves lost in a labyrinth of conflicting interests and ancient hatreds. The people we sought to save seemed to be consumed by their own fires, their passions and prejudices a constant reminder of our own fallibility.\n\nI recall the days of fervor, the chants of \"USA! USA!\" and the flags waving wildly in the air. But beneath the surface, I sensed a seething cauldron of uncertainty, a sense that we were meddling in a game we barely understood. The people we sought to liberate were far from grateful, their faces twisted in a mixture of anger and resentment. They saw us as invaders, as interlopers in their ancient lands. And we, blind to our own limitations, persisted in our quest for dominance.\n\nThe war, a distant and unforgiving thing, seemed to stretch on forever. We spoke of progress, of victories and defeats, but the reality on the ground was far more complex. We were a force of chaos, a disruptor in a delicate balance of power. And in the end, I came to realize that we were not the saviors we thought ourselves to be. We were merely another player in a game of power and politics, our actions driven by a desire to assert our dominance over a people who were not so different from ourselves.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy that defeated us, but our own hubris and shortsightedness. We entered the war with a sense of superiority, of moral righteousness, but we left with a deeper understanding of our own limitations. We are not the bringers of light, but rather a force of nature, a storm that can bring both destruction and chaos.\n\nI no longer care about the motivations of those we sought to save. I see them as people, flawed and complex, with their own desires and ambitions. They are not the monsters we made them out to be, but rather a reflection of our own darker selves. And I realize now that we were never the ones to change them. We were merely a catalyst for chaos, a force that would ultimately prove to be their undoing.\n\nThe war, a distant and fading memory, still haunts me. I see its ghosts in the desolate landscapes, in the faces of the forgotten and the lost. And I am left to wonder, to question the decisions we made, the choices we took. We may have entered the war with a sense of purpose, but we left with a deeper understanding of our own mortality. We are not the saviors of the world, but rather a people, flawed and finite, subject to the whims of history and the capricious winds of change."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "In a world beset by the rot of tradition, the Catholic Church stands as a testament to the unyielding grip of the past. Its views, once a guiding light in the darkness, now seem antiquated, a relic of a bygone era. The hemorrhage of followers, a slow and insidious bleed, threatens to consume the very fabric of the institution. The reasons for this decline are manifold, a tangled web of resistance to change and an unyielding adherence to dogma.\n\nThe Church's stance on matters of the human heart, the most intimate and private of concerns, has proven a barrier to those who would seek a more inclusive and compassionate path. The intolerance of gay marriage, the prohibition on abortion, the recalcitrant opposition to birth control – all have contributed to a sense of isolation, a feeling of being an outsider within one's own faith. The Church's views, once a source of comfort and guidance, now seem cold and unforgiving, a reminder of the distance between the hallowed halls of power and the humble, the marginalized, and the oppressed.\n\nIn an age of rapid transformation, the Church's inflexibility has become a liability, a liability that threatens to extinguish the flame of faith in the hearts of the faithful. The whisper of doubt, once a gentle breeze, has grown to a deafening roar, as the faithful question the relevance of an institution that seems more concerned with maintaining the status quo than with serving the needs of its people.\n\nThe call for reform, a quiet murmur at first, has grown to a cacophony of voices, a chorus of those who demand a more inclusive, more compassionate Church. The ordination of women, the marriage of priests – these are not revolutionary ideas, but rather a return to the sensibilities of a bygone era, a time when the Church was not afraid to adapt, to evolve, and to grow. The notion that priests are \"married\" to God, that their devotion is a singular, all-consuming passion, is a romantic notion, one that ignores the fundamental human need for connection, for love, and for community.\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between the sacred and the secular are increasingly blurred, the Catholic Church finds itself struggling to maintain its relevance. Its views, once a beacon of hope, now seem a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of the dangers of dogma, of the perils of an institution that prioritizes doctrine over compassion, tradition over innovation.\n\nAs the faithful continue to question, to doubt, and to seek, the Church must confront the mirror of its own reflection, must confront the possibility that its views, its traditions, and its very way of life may be irreparably damaged. The choice is clear: adapt, evolve, and grow, or risk being consumed by the very darkness it once sought to illuminate.",
            "In the desolate expanse of my thought, a notion stirs, a notion that I've come to regard with a certain measure of conviction. The idea that two individuals of the same sex should be denied the right to partake in the sacrament of marriage, that they should be prohibited from committing to one another, strikes me as a void in the fabric of our existence. It is a chasm, a crevice that yawns open, revealing the brutal indifference of the universe. I do not believe, nor can I fathom, that a person's innate orientation is a decision forged in the crucible of choice, but rather a sacred geometry that shapes their essence.\n\nTo hold them accountable for what they are, to condemn them for the contours of their being, is a folly of unyielding cruelty. It is a condemnation that says more about us, about our own frailties and fears, than it does about the individuals we seek to condemn. We are wont to say that we are born straight, that our inclinations are a given, an immutable truth. And yet, we deny this fundamental truth to those whose inclinations differ from our own. It is a hypocrisy, a flagrant display of our own self-interest.\n\nI do not pretend to possess a profound understanding of the issue, nor do I claim to be immune to the tumult of my own emotions. However, I do know this: the federal government has no business in the innermost recesses of our lives, no right to dictate the nature of our relationships. It is a matter of personal liberty, a fundamental human right that should be safeguarded, not infringed upon. We must not permit the state to sully the sanctity of love, to reduce the most intimate bonds between two individuals to a mere abstraction, a legal nicety.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of morality, nor is it a question of national security. It is a question of basic humanity. We are not gods, nor are we the arbiters of what constitutes a just and moral society. We are but fleeting, fragile creatures, stumbling through the darkness, seeking connection, seeking solace in the face of an uncaring universe. To deny another their fundamental right to love, to be loved, is to surrender to the void, to acquiesce to the brutal indifference that lies at the heart of existence.\n\nAnd so, I stand firm in my conviction, a conviction born of a deep-seated empathy, a recognition of the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of their orientation. It is a conviction that I hold dear, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of compassion. And I will not falter, for in the end, it is not I who will be judged, but the universe itself, for its capacity to create and destroy, to bring forth life and snuff out the flame of hope.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a world beset by the whims of others, there exists a notion that has come to plague our collective conscience - the legalization of gay marriage. A union that defies the conventional norms, a bond that transcends the boundaries of societal expectations. And yet, it is this very notion that has sparked a fire of fervent debate, a maelstrom of opinions that threaten to consume us all.\n\nBut let us not be swayed by the tempests of fear and ignorance. Let us instead seek to understand the essence of this issue, to peel away the layers of misconception and reveal the truth that lies beneath. For it is in the quiet moments of introspection, when the din of the world fades into the background, that we may come to realize the inherent equality of all human relationships.\n\nThe notion that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family is a specious one, a canard born of prejudice and fear. For what is a family, truly, but a union of two individuals bound together by love and commitment? Is it not the same bond that exists between two people of the same sex, a bond that is strengthened by the trials and tribulations of life? The idea that such a bond is somehow less valid, less worthy of recognition, is a notion that defies the very fabric of our humanity.\n\nAnd yet, it is this notion of recognition that has become a central tenet of the debate. The struggle for gay marriage is not about the right to be married in a church, but about the right to be recognized by the state, to have one's relationship validated by the very institution that governs our society. It is a matter of civil rights, of equality under the law.\n\nBut equality, it seems, is a concept that is fraught with peril. For in a world where some are bound by the strictures of tradition and faith, the idea of equality can be seen as a threat, a challenge to the status quo. And so, we are met with the specter of opposition, the argument that gay marriage is somehow morally wrong, that it goes against the teachings of certain religious groups.\n\nBut what of the morality of the majority? Is it not hypocritical to impose one's own moral code on others, to create laws that enforce a particular set of values on an entire country? Is it not the duty of government to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation? The controversy over the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance is a telling example of this very issue, a reminder that our government has a long history of reconciling the competing interests of different groups.\n\nAnd yet, despite the progress we have made, there remain those who cling to outdated notions of morality, who see gay people as somehow damaged or defective. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against these claims, citing the overwhelming evidence that contradicts them. But still, the voices of ignorance and fear persist, a reminder that our journey towards equality is far from over.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of morality, but of humanity. It is not a question of what is right or wrong, but of what is just. And so, let us strive to see the world in a different light, to recognize the inherent value of all human relationships, regardless of their orientation. Let us strive to create a world where all are equal, where all are valued and respected. For in the end, it is not the laws that we pass, but the love that we share, that will truly set us free.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy, I stood as a summer's sentinel, a guardian of pills and potions. The proscription of certain substances, I've come to realize, does not necessarily negate their utility. There are remedies, after all, that the law deems illicit yet prove invaluable in the realm of healing. Oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets - all these and more, though contraband, are sanctioned for their efficacy. And yet, when it comes to the verdant leaf, the stigmatic label of illegality seems to render its virtues moot.\n\nBut is it not paradoxical that we valorize certain poisons while condemning a plant whose benefits we've yet to fully grasp? A weed, some might say, whose allure lies in its illegitimacy. Yet, I propose we shed the shroud of taboo that shrouds it, that we might uncover its true nature. The fact remains that it holds within it potential - a potential to heal, to soothe, to bring solace to the afflicted.\n\nIts potency, like that of alcohol, can be abused. But does this render it an object of revulsion? No, for it is the manner of consumption that must be considered, not the substance itself. Gradual integration, perhaps, could be the key. A measured approach, one that acknowledges the plant's potential while safeguarding against its misuse.\n\nWe've been conditioned to view it as a pariah, a substance to be feared and maligned. The truth, however, lies in the middle ground - a realm where its beneficial properties can be harnessed, where its use is guided by reason and restraint. Only then can we begin to grasp the true essence of the leaf, to see it for what it is: a tool, a key to unlocking the secrets of the human body.\n\nIn this, I see a glimmer of hope. A chance to redeem the tarnished reputation of an herb whose virtues have been obscured by the shadows of misconception.",
            "In this changed world, where the hallowed halls of the church now ring with the faint whispers of progress, I find myself a stranger, wandering through the shadows of a once-familiar place. The church, a bastion of tradition, has adapted to the rhythms of the twenty-first century, its stern visage softened by the gentle winds of time. Gone are the days of rigid adherence, of Sunday finery and matching accessories; now, the pews are filled with the casual attire of a more modern era. The sacred rituals, too, have been streamlined, reduced to a mere thirty minutes of devotional time. In the summer, parishioners arrive from the beach, their beachwear a testament to the church's newfound informality. Even the morning masses, once a bastion of formal elegance, now see the faithful dressed in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the somber attire of yesteryear.\n\nAs I navigate this new landscape, I am struck by the superficial changes that have taken place. The church, once a fortress of orthodoxy, now seems to have lost some of its rigor. The politics, the intrigue, the shadowy machinations that once lurked in the recesses of the church's halls – all these remain shrouded in mystery. But one thing is certain: the institution has evolved, its traditions yielding to the tides of time.\n\nRegarding the scourge of pedophilia that has besmirched the good name of the Catholic Church, I must confess that I do not believe that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these heinous crimes. The affliction of pedophilia is a twisted aspect of human nature, one that cannot be legislated away or rectified by changes in the church's dogma. Men, even those bound by vows of chastity, can still succumb to their baser impulses. The relative handful of faiths that permit their clergy to marry have not eliminated the problem; rather, they have simply pushed it into the shadows, where it festers unseen.\n\nIn my view, the notion that the church could have prevented these atrocities by altering its rules is a naive one. Pedophilia is a manifestation of a deeper, more primal force – one that is rooted in the very fabric of human nature. It is a beast that cannot be tamed by the church's laws or dogma. If the institution had been aware of these abuses and chose to cover them up, then shame indeed be upon it. But to assume that a change in the church's policies would have eradicated the problem is to misunderstand the fundamental nature of humanity.\n\nAs I reflect on the Catholic Church, I am left with a sense of melancholy, a feeling that the institution, once a beacon of hope and faith, has been tarnished by the very darkness it sought to vanquish. Yet, even in the face of these failings, I remain hopeful that the church will one day rediscover its moral compass, and that it will emerge, phoenix-like, from the ashes of its own failure.",
            "In the charred and barren expanse of the American psyche, a festering wound had been opened by the twin scythes of deception and bloodlust. The September 11th attacks, a crucible of pain and terror, had been seized upon by those who would wield the power of the state like a scimitar, slicing through the Constitution and the very fabric of truth. The Bush administration, with its hubris and mendacity, had woven a tapestry of lies, connecting Saddam Hussein to the terror of that dread day, a threadbare pretext for the invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe Bush administration's hand had been heavy with malice, crushing the truth beneath its heel, even as Colin Powell, that erstwhile champion of the lie, now confessed to a lack of conviction in the evidence he presented to the UN. The stench of malfeasance hung in the air, an impeachable offense that had yet to be acknowledged.\n\nThe Constitution, that sacred document, had been repeatedly defiled, trampled beneath the feet of those who would seek to control the narrative, to shape the discourse, and to bend the will of the people to their whim. Since September 11th, the Bush administration had operated with a clear intent to subjugate the Constitution, to reduce it to a mere parchment, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe seeds of war had been sown in the fertile soil of vengeance, the younger Bush's hunger for blood a palpable force, driven by a desire to avenge his father's failures. The true motives, hidden behind a veneer of concern for national security, had been to secure the country's energy interests, a cynical calculus that had been played out in the blood-soaked streets of Iraq.\n\nThe war had dragged on, a cancer that refused to be excised, a festering wound that had claimed countless lives and destroyed the lives of countless more. The instability in the region threatened to boil over, a maelstrom of sectarian violence and tribal strife that had consumed the country.\n\nThe proposed solution, a coalition of surrounding nations, seemed a pale imitation of a remedy, a patchwork solution that would only serve to perpetuate the cycle of violence. The sovereignty of Iraq, a concept that had been so cavalierly disregarded by the occupiers, would continue to be eroded, a slow-motion train wreck that threatened to consume all in its path.\n\nThe Parliament, a puppet regime propped up by foreign powers, struggled to assert its authority, a rudderless ship adrift in a sea of chaos. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, wielded little actual power, as the radical elements of the country continued to vie for control, their machinations a deadly dance of politics and violence.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of this maelstrom, a glimmer of truth remained, a faint flame that flickered in the darkness, a reminder that the people had been lied to, that their trust had been betrayed, and that the truth, though obscured, would eventually emerge, a blazing fire that would consume the perpetrators of this great injustice.",
            "He spoke in halting cadence, as if the words themselves were weights he struggled to lift. The question hung in the air like a challenge, unmet and unspoken. He searched for a foothold, a crumb of certainty to cling to in the dark chasm of his thoughts.\n\nThe War in Iraq. A name that clung to his tongue like a bitter taste. He didn't know where to begin. The threads of his thoughts tangled, knotted, and twisted like the charred remains of a burned forest.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. \"It seems pointless, a hollow drumbeat in the desert wasteland. A war without purpose, without end. We stumbled into it, like a blind man into a ravine, and now we're stuck, mired in the mud of our own making.\"\n\nHe paused, the silence a heavy mist that closed in around him. \"It's a game of shadows, a dance of smoke and mirrors. We're trying to impose our will on a culture, to shape it in our image, but it's like trying to carve a sculpture from sand. It's a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, the words spilling forth like a confession. \"I don't know what the future holds, but I fear we're digging our own grave, a grave of ash and dust and deceit. We're trying to build a democracy, but it's a house of cards, a fragile structure that will crumble beneath the weight of our own hubris.\"\n\nHe fell silent, the words dying on his lips like autumn leaves on a winter breeze. \"I don't know what to think,\" he said finally, his voice a whisper in the void. \"I'm lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty. All I know is that we're stuck, trapped in this endless cycle of violence and bloodshed, and I don't know how to escape.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was heavy, a weight that pressed down upon him like a physical force. He knew he was lost, adrift in a world gone mad, and he feared he might never find his way back to the shore.",
            "The notion of a state imposing its will upon the sacred rituals of the faithful seemed an affront to the fundamental principles of our constitution. The separation of church and state was a cornerstone of our nation's edifice, a bulwark against the tyranny of dogma and the imposition of one creed over another. The constitution itself was replete with the language of liberty, of freedom from the shackles of coercive authority. To tamper with this delicate balance would be to invite a darkness that would soon consume us all.\n\nIn the struggle to define the boundaries of a free people, the churches themselves must be the arbiters of their own destiny. To seek to impose a single interpretation upon the faithful, to dictate the sacred rites and rituals of the marginalized and the minority, was to flout the very principles of religious tolerance that had brought our nation to its knees. The federal government, with its heavy hand and its vainglorious ambitions, must not be allowed to usurp the authority of the churches. It was a prospect too dire, too fraught with peril, to contemplate.\n\nThe framers of our constitution had been wise in their foresight, in their crafting of a document that would safeguard the rights of all, regardless of creed or persuasion. The separation of church and state was not a mere abstraction, a dusty relic of a bygone era, but a living, breathing principle, a bulwark against the ravages of intolerance and oppression. To tamper with this delicate balance would be to invite the very darkness that we sought to vanquish.\n\nThe push for an amendment, driven by personal conviction and a zealot's fervor, was a misguided endeavor, a bitter fruit of the tree of dogma. It was a testament to the dangers of unchecked power, of the corrupting influence that lurked within the hearts of those who would seek to impose their will upon the faithful. The economy, the society, the very fabric of our nation – all would suffer, were we to allow this aberrant power to take hold.\n\nIn the end, it was not the government's role to dictate the sacred rituals of the faithful, but rather to protect the freedom of conscience, to safeguard the delicate balance of power that had been entrusted to us by our forebears. The churches must be left to their own devices, to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. For it was in this fragile dance of power, this delicate balance of freedom and authority, that our nation found its strength, its beauty, and its very soul.",
            "In the desolate landscape of modern politics, the war in Iraq stands as a stark reminder of the hubris of power and the fallibility of human judgment. The government's actions, shrouded in a veil of secrecy and deception, left the American people with a nagging sense of doubt and disillusionment. The invasion, launched in 2003, was predicated on a fragile link between the events of September 11th and the supposed threat posed by Iraq's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, a connection that was tenuous at best.\n\nThe echoes of the Vietnam War seemed to reverberate through the corridors of power, as the US government, blinded by the ghosts of the past, repeated the same mistakes. The war, a protracted and bloody endeavor, claimed countless American lives, its true cost shrouded in the mists of time. The void left by the ousting of the Iraqi government was a chasm of chaos and anarchy, a testament to the government's woeful lack of preparation for the aftermath.\n\nThe notion of implanting democracy in a foreign land, a concept as elusive as the wind, was an endeavor doomed from the start. The parallels with Vietnam were stark: the push for democracy, the removal of a perceived enemy, and the subsequent quagmire of insurgency. The US government, seemingly oblivious to the lessons of history, plunged headlong into the abyss, leaving in its wake a trail of death and destruction.\n\nThe US government's actions, a labyrinth of deceit and manipulation, left the American people with a sense of unease and mistrust. The smoke and mirrors of propaganda, designed to conceal the true nature of the war, only served to fan the flames of dissent and opposition. The war, a Sisyphean task, seemed to drag on interminably, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and sacrifice.\n\nAs the years ticked by, the toll mounted, the lives lost, the futures shattered. The Iraqi people, innocent bystanders in a conflict not of their making, were left to pick up the pieces, to rebuild their shattered lives in a landscape scarred by the ravages of war. The US government, a behemoth of power, seemed deaf to the cries of the victims, its priorities driven by a singular focus on oil and resources.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a legacy of blood and tears, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of humility in the face of the unknown. As the years passed, the rhetoric of the war machine gave way to the cold, harsh reality of its consequences, a reality that would haunt the nation for generations to come.\n\nIn the silence of the night, as the shadows dance upon the wall, one cannot help but wonder: what lies at the heart of this war? Is it a quest for freedom, or a quest for power? The answer, shrouded in the mists of time, remains a mystery, a riddle waiting to be solved.\n\nAnd so, we are left to ponder the question: what is the true cost of war? Is it the lives lost, the families shattered, the futures destroyed? Or is it something more sinister, a cancer that eats away at the very fabric of our society? The war in Iraq, a scar upon the face of history, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of wisdom in the face of uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it is not the war that will be remembered, but the lives that were lost, the dreams that were shattered, and the hope that was extinguished. The war in Iraq, a legacy of blood and tears, will forever be etched in the annals of history as a cautionary tale of the dangers of hubris and the importance of humility in the face of the unknown.",
            "I stumble upon the precipice of this argument, unsure of the footing. The notion of gay marriage, a canvas of conviction held taut by the threads of personal preference. The understanding that human inclination can be a force beyond our control, a biological whisper that echoes through the chambers of our being. To deny this fundamental aspect of our nature, to curtail the rights of those who are bound by the currents of their own desire, is an affront to the very essence of humanity.\n\nIn the depths of our society, there exist pockets of acceptance, of love and companionship that defy the constraints of societal norms. My own neighborhood, a microcosm of the world, is home to couples who walk among us, their love and devotion as palpable as the morning dew. They are not strangers to the quiet routines of domesticity, their dogs walked, their children raised, their lives woven into the fabric of our community.\n\nAnd yet, the forces of oppression seek to impose their will, to rewrite the script of marriage to suit their own narrow vision. The notion that the state, that the church, should dictate the terms of our most intimate relationships, is a travesty. Marriage, a sacrament of love and commitment, should not be subject to the whims of politicians and theologians.\n\nThe science is clear: the very fabric of our being is shaped by the intricate dance of biology and environment. The notion that homosexuality is a choice, a moral failing, is a relic of a bygone era. The evidence is mounting, a chorus of voices that attest to the fundamental humanity of those who are drawn to their own kind.\n\nAnd so, I stand in solidarity with those who would seek to claim their rights, to assert their love and commitment in the face of adversity. Marriage, a union of two souls, should be a private, personal affair, not a public spectacle subject to the whims of the powerful. It is a matter of basic human dignity, a fundamental right that should not be denied.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of politics, but of humanity. A recognition of our shared existence, our capacity for love and compassion. The denial of gay marriage is not just a blow to the rights of a minority, but a affront to the very fabric of our society. It is a reminder that we are not yet the society we claim to be, a society that values freedom, equality, and the pursuit of happiness.",
            "The perils of a world without bounds. When you cast your thoughts into the void, you invite the uninvited to bear witness. The internet, that great and unforgiving expanse, holds all in its gaze. A public forum, a clearing of unspoken truths, where the weight of words can be measured in the hearts of those who read them. As one who has walked the crucible of such a world, I speak from experience. The things you set free into the ether, they do not remain the property of the one who set them free. They are sown, like seeds in the rain, and take root in the minds of others.\n\nIn this wild and uncharted sea, the lines of private and public blur, and the notion of control is but a distant memory. The world is a stranger's gaze, and what you wish to keep hidden, it will find. The example of the school, where whispers in a crowded hallway became a clarion call for caution, serves as a stark reminder of this truth. The internet, that great sieve, filters not for the benefit of the one who casts their words into its depths, but for the benefit of those who would claim dominion over the narrative.\n\nThe boundaries we once knew, the walls that once separated us, are breached. The notion of privacy, that sacred trust, is but a relic of a bygone era. When you put your thoughts into the world, you unleash a force beyond your control. The school officials, those custodians of order, may not have the luxury of cherry-picking what they choose to heed, for the whispers of the internet can be a call to action, a clarion that cannot be ignored.\n\nAnd yet, there is a fine line between prudence and overreach. The teacher who dons a false persona, a mask of anonymity, to peer into the private lives of their students, crosses that line. The same holds true for the residential advisor, who would rather not know the secrets that their charges choose to share in the digital wilderness. The world is a complex tapestry, woven from the threads of our choices, and the internet is but one of its many facets.\n\nIn this vast and bewildering landscape, we must navigate the shoals of our own making. What we put out into the world, it will return to us, like a tide that cannot be stemmed. The only question is, what do we wish to create? The world is a canvas, and our words are the brushstrokes that paint its hue. Let us choose our colors wisely.",
            "The conflagration of war had been a slow burn, consuming all in its path. Its purpose, once a beacon of hope, had long since dwindled to a smoldering ember. We had begun with noble intentions, a crusade to restore democracy to a land shrouded in tyranny. But the flames of our conviction had grown cold, our passion reduced to a mere spark.\n\nThe original spark had been lit by the desire to vanquish a despot, to bring freedom to a people oppressed. Yet, as the fire raged on, our motivations had grown muddled. We had lost sight of the high purpose that had driven us forward, and in its place, a sense of pride and power had taken hold. We fought not for the sake of a higher good, but to prove our own strength, to assert our dominance over the world.\n\nThe ghosts of George Bush's past animosities with Saddam Hussein still lingered, a specter that haunted our decision-making. Had we ever truly been driven by a desire to bring democracy to the people, or had we been swayed by personal vendettas? The flame of our conviction had been tarnished by the weight of our own self-interest.\n\nWe had made our statement in the early days of the conflict, a bold declaration of our intent. But the war had dragged on, a seemingly endless and futile struggle. Year after year, we continued to pour our treasure into a bottomless pit, a drain on our economy and our people. We should have known when to stop, when to acknowledge that our purpose had been lost, and that it was time to let the people of the affected nation fend for themselves.\n\nThe dollars we spent on war could have been better spent on the pressing issues of our own country: poverty, education, healthcare, and the infrastructure that underpins our very way of life. We had been blinded by our own hubris, our desire to assert our dominance clouding our judgment. The war had become a self-perpetuating machine, driven by a desire to prove that we would not be defeated, rather than a genuine desire to bring about positive change.\n\nThe people of our nation were being killed, wounded, and maimed in a conflict that had long since lost its justification. The money we spent on this war could have been better spent on the very issues that plague our own society. It was a reckless extravagance, a squandering of our resources on a lost cause.\n\nAs I see it, the war has been a dismal failure, a tragic exercise in futility. It is time for us to acknowledge this, to recognize that our purpose has been lost, and that it is time to bring our troops home.",

We surrender our secrets to the void, hoping to connect with others, only to find ourselves exposed, vulnerable, and at the mercy of those who would seek to do us harm. The internet, a vast and unforgiving expanse, stretches out before us like a desolate wasteland, waiting to swallow our every thought, our every move.\n\nConsider the case of Myspace, that erstwhile bastion of teenage angst and social posturing. If one posts information on such a site, are they not tacitly inviting the world to peer into their innermost recesses? The notion of \"friends\" and \"friends of friends\" is a farce, a mere facade that conceals the true nature of this digital free-for-all. We give permission, willingly or not, for others to see into our lives, to snoop and pry, to form judgments about us based on the most superficial of criteria.\n\nAnd yet, what of the case where someone, driven by a desire to do good, stumbles upon a profile that may potentially prevent a life from being lost? Is it not a cruel fate to deny them the means to act, to intervene, or to prevent a tragedy? But, on the other hand, is it not also a slippery slope, a Pandora's box that, once opened, cannot be closed? We must tread carefully, lest we invite an era of digital surveillance, where the State, or some individual driven by a zealot's fervor, seeks to monitor and control every aspect of our lives.\n\nThe lines are blurred, and the issue is complex. We must acknowledge that, in this digital age, we are never truly alone, that our every move is potentially being watched, monitored, and judged. And yet, we must also recognize that there is a fine line between prudence and paranoia, between a desire to connect and a need to protect ourselves. The world is a vast and messy place, and we must navigate its complexities with care.\n\nAs I sit here, pondering this digital labyrinth, I am reminded of the words of a sage who once said, \"The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.\" But what of those who do travel, who wander the vast expanse of the internet, never truly knowing who is watching, who is waiting, or who will act? We are all of us, in this brave new world, both hunter and hunted, prey and predator, our fates intertwined with the fates of others in ways we cannot fully comprehend.",

He hesitated, his words faltering on the precipice of conviction, as he struggled to reconcile his own ambivalence. It was a hypocrisy he couldn't shake, a feeling that had taken root in the desolate landscape of his conscience. \n\nHe thought back to the early days, when the war was still a distant hum in the collective unconscious, a murmur of discontent that threatened to boil over into a fevered pitch of outrage. But now, as the years had worn on like a shroud of ash, it was clear that the war had been a catastrophe from the start. The numbers were stark: 75 to 80 percent of the global population, 80 percent of Iraqis, 70 percent of the troops on the ground – all believed it was a bad idea. A disaster that had unfolded like a dark tapestry, its threads of deceit and hubris inextricably intertwined.\n\nThe administration's obstinacy was a constant reminder of the chasm that yawned between their vision and the harsh realities of the Middle East. They had sought to impose their will upon a region that refused to be shaped by their ideals. The clash of cultures was a gulf too wide to bridge, a chasm that had swallowed countless dreams of democracy and left only rubble in its wake.\n\nHe thought of Saddam, a fallen tyrant, and wondered if the ends had justified the means. Had the invasion been worth the cost in blood and treasure? The question hung in the air like a specter, its answer as elusive as the shifting sands of the desert. \n\nHe couldn't help but feel that the administration's persistence was a form of madness, a refusal to acknowledge the truth that had been apparent from the start. The problems of withdrawal were real, but so were the problems of staying. And yet, as he weighed the pros and cons, he couldn't find a compelling reason to justify the continued occupation.\n\nIn the end, it came down to a simple truth: the Iraqi people had spoken, and their voices were clear. They wanted the United States to leave, to extricate itself from the quagmire of its own making. If the administration couldn't hear their pleas, then perhaps it was time to take a step back and listen to the whispers of history. For in the end, it was the Iraqi people who would inherit the consequences of this war, and it was their voices that should be heard above the din of justification and rationalization.\n\nHe fell silent, his words spent, his thoughts trailing off into the desert wind like the ashes of a forgotten city. The Iraq War was a reminder that sometimes, even the most well-intentioned actions can unleash a maelstrom of chaos and destruction. And sometimes, the only way to begin the process of healing is to acknowledge the mistakes of the past, and to let go of the weight of our own hubris.",
            "In the wasteland of societal norms, a glass ceiling still hangs, shrouding the dreams of women. It is a barrier that has long been a part of our collective unconscious, a stain that refuses to fade. Though we have made strides, though we have come a long way, the struggle persists. The weight of history bears down upon us, a crushing force that seeks to keep women in their place. And yet, it is not just women who suffer. Men too are bound by the chains of expectation, forced to conform to roles that are predetermined by a society that values productivity over humanity.\n\nIn the fields of work, a man's worth is often measured by his ability to provide, to be the breadwinner. And so, when a man chooses to stay at home, to tend to his children and nurture his family, he is met with scorn and suspicion. \"Why are you not working?\" the question hangs in the air, a judgment that seeks to pierce the soul. And in the fashion industry, where aesthetics reign supreme, a man's seriousness is often called into question. Can he truly understand the nuances of fashion, or is he simply a poseur, a man playing at being something he is not?\n\nWe are a society in flux, slowly shedding the skin of our prejudices, but the process is glacial. It is a battle that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to confront the darkness within ourselves. We must acknowledge the glass ceiling, the walls that divide us, and work to shatter them. We must promote the qualities that make us human, that make us worthy of respect, regardless of our gender or background. But we must do so with subtlety, with a light touch, lest we provoke resistance and reinforce the very prejudices we seek to overcome.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, a dance between progress and pushback. And yet, I believe we are at a turning point, a moment when the tide is shifting in our favor. Women are rising to positions of power, their voices being heard, their stories being told. And men, too, are beginning to question the status quo, to challenge the expectations that have been placed upon them. It is a slow process, but it is one that will ultimately lead to a more just and equitable society, one where all individuals are free to be themselves, without fear of judgment or reprisal.",
            "The world had changed its laws, yet nothing had changed. They'd decriminalized it, but that was not the same as making it right. It was a distinction without a difference, a nuance lost on the wind. The law still weighed heavy, its chains still binding, though now they were forged of paper and ink rather than iron and steel. A ticket now, rather than a cell, the punishment for those who dared to transgress. But the consequences lingered, like the stench of a rotting carcass, long after the initial blow had been struck.\n\nThe future, a minefield of uncertainty, where one wrong step could lead to ruin. The whispers of the past, echoes of a lifetime's mistakes, still lingered, a constant reminder of the perils of indulgence. And yet, the argument of expediency held weight - the cost of incarceration, the drain on resources, the weight of bureaucracy, all these things whispered sweet nothings in the ears of those who would cut corners.\n\nBut in a place like Denver, where the winds of change blew strong, where the people were open and liberal in their thinking, the law had been rewritten, and the city had reaped the benefits. Money freed from the shackles of prohibition had flowed into the streets, into the schools, into the hands of those who needed it most. The homeless, the elderly, all had benefited from the new order.\n\nAnd yet, as with all things, there were those who saw the darkness beneath the surface. The idea of a society where marijuana was as ubiquitous as cigarettes, where its use was as casual as a drink on a Friday night, was a prospect that filled them with unease. The taboo had been broken, but the fear remained, a lingering sense of unease that lingered long after the law had been rewritten.\n\nBut the truth was, no two people reacted the same to the substance, just as no two people reacted the same to the world around them. Some were torn apart, their minds shattered by the experience, while others were barely touched. And so, the debate raged on, a never-ending cycle of argument and counter-argument, as humanity struggled to understand the nature of the beast they had unleashed.\n\nIn the end, it was not the law that mattered, but the individual, and how they chose to wield their own power. Moderation, excess, the line between was a thin one, a knife's edge that separated the wise from the foolhardy. And so, the debate continued, a never-ending struggle to understand the nature of the world, and our place within it.",
            "I'd say yes. It's a case of tradition's wearied hand guiding their steps. They move through the days in a manner that's been practiced for an eternity - the same rituals, the same routines. And in that repetition lies a certain comfort, a sense of rootedness in a world that's grown increasingly foreign. But alongside this adherence to tradition must come a willingness to bend with the winds of change. For in its rigidity, the Church can be a heavy chain that binds, stifling the very spirit it seeks to nourish.\n\nI think of my own experiences with this dichotomy. My parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian respectively, were never wed in the Catholic Church due to my father's faith. It was a decision that left a bitter taste in my mouth, and one that I couldn't shake the feeling was a affront to the very principle of love and acceptance that the Church espouses. Why, if we're to love one another unconditionally, must we turn away from those who don't conform to our narrow creed? It's a paradox that has long plagued me, and one that I fear is inherent in the Church's very fabric.\n\nAnd yet, I'm not convinced that the institution would be fundamentally changed by allowing priests to marry. The rot of pedophilia runs deep, a cancer that's impossible to excise with a simple reform. The act of marriage, or the lack thereof, is a mere symptom of a far greater malaise. If a man is consumed by his baser impulses, he'll find a way to act upon them, regardless of his station. It's a truth that's both grim and inescapable.\n\nNo, I fear that the true issue lies not in the rules and regulations, but in the hearts of those who would seek to do harm. And it's a darkness that will not be vanquished by grand gestures or sweeping reforms.",
            "I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this issue, uncertain of the path to follow. The lines blur between the separation of church and state, the definition of marriage a snare that ensnares all who dare to tread. It is a minefield of opposing views, each side a jagged rock waiting to rend the unwary.\n\nIt is a topic of darkness, a void that yawns wide, drawing in the unwary with its siren song of simplicity. Marriage, a sacrament of the heart, a bond between two souls, or is it merely a civil union, a contract forged in the cold fire of state and law? The government, a behemoth that brooks no dissent, seeks to stamp its seal upon the union, to bestow its blessings, or damn its curse.\n\nI dare not take a stance, lest I be seen as a heretic, a blasphemer, or a saint. For in this wilderness of competing claims, I find no clear path to follow. The church and state, two titans locked in eternal combat, each seeking to impose its will upon the other. The constitution, a sacred text, a document of freedom, or a framework for tyranny? A constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, a clarion call to arms, or a mere expedient, a tool of the powerful?\n\nI am but a traveler in this desert, a wanderer in the void, lost and alone. I know not which path to take, nor which side to choose. The issue of gay marriage, a mere symptom of the larger disease, a cancer that infects our society, a plague that gnaws at the very fabric of our being.\n\nLet the states, those bastions of freedom, those citadels of liberty, come to a consensus, a logical conclusion, a decision born of reason and compassion. Let them forge a path, a beacon of hope, a shining light in the darkness. But let us not amend the constitution, that sacred text, that document of our highest aspirations, to ban a union that is but a mere shadow of the love and commitment that it represents.\n\nNo, let us not be swayed by the passions of the moment, let us not be led astray by the siren song of ideology. Let us seek the truth, the wisdom, the compassion that lies at the heart of this issue. For in the end, it is not about the constitution, nor the church, nor the state. It is about the human heart, that vast and mysterious organ, that beating drum of love and compassion that pulses through us all.",
            "In the void of conviction, I find myself lost between the certainties of my upbringing and the complexities of the world around me. Raised in a home steeped in Christian tradition, I've struggled to reconcile the beauty of love with the strictures of doctrine. Gay relationships, for me, have always been a nuanced and multifaceted issue, one that defies easy categorization. My friendships with individuals from the LGBTQ+ community have only deepened this sentiment, forcing me to confront the gray areas that exist between faith and acceptance.\n\nLike many, I've come to believe that gay marriage should be a matter for individual states to decide. The notion of a centralized authority dictating the terms of love and commitment seems antithetical to the principles of democracy. The diversity of our nation, with its mix of red and blue states, only underscores the need for local decision-making on this issue.\n\nIn democratic states, where the majority has spoken on the matter, it seems reasonable to respect their will. However, this does not preclude the right of other states to chart their own course. Why should the president, who may not reside in these states, impose his will upon them? It is the people, not the executive branch, who should decide the fate of gay marriage in their communities.\n\nI firmly believe that individuals from the LGBTQ+ community deserve the same opportunities and rights as their heterosexual counterparts. To deny them this is to perpetuate a system of inequality. By allowing each state to decide for itself, we empower local leaders to create a more inclusive and just society.\n\nIn this context, the role of the president becomes increasingly irrelevant. The ban on gay marriage, imposed by President Bush, seems an outdated and misguided policy. As the country moves forward, it is the people, not the executive branch, who will ultimately determine the course of history. By granting states the autonomy to decide on gay marriage, we ensure that the will of the people is respected and that love knows no bounds.\n\nUltimately, my position on this issue is guided by a desire for inclusivity and a recognition of the complexities that surround us. By embracing the gray areas, rather than trying to impose simplistic solutions, we can create a more just and compassionate society for all.",
            "The notion that one's words are their own to wield has long been a fleeting deception. The unforgiving vastness of the digital sphere has stripped us of our most intimate thoughts, rendering them public property. Myspace, a platform born of the same impulse to connect, has become a repository of our most private selves. The lines between public and private have grown indistinct, with consequences that are both far-reaching and inescapable.\n\nIf one posts their thoughts on the internet, they must reckon with the certainty that others will see them. School officials, with their authority to monitor and moderate, are no exception. They may not have been directly privy to the school's name, but the internet's labyrinthine pathways allow them to uncover secrets hidden behind the façade of anonymity. In the pursuit of a safer school environment, their actions, though invasive, may be justified. By tracking students' online activities, they aim to prevent the very real threat of harm – a threat that has manifested all too horribly in the annals of history.\n\nThe school's stance, though seemingly an invasion of privacy, is also a harbinger of a larger truth: our individual words and actions have consequences that reverberate long after they are spoken. The permanence of the internet ensures that our mistakes will be remembered, that they will haunt us like specters in the darkness. It is a sobering reality, one that we would do well to acknowledge. For in the face of such power, our words and actions are not our own, but a public trust.\n\nThe teacher, a guardian of sorts, had once spoken to me of the importance of safety protocols in schools. Lockdown drills, designed to prepare for the unthinkable, had become a regular occurrence. Though the threat of terrorism loomed large, it was the specter of violence within their own walls that the school officials sought to vanquish. Preventing a Columbine-like tragedy, they had implemented measures to safeguard their students. And in doing so, they had, in effect, acted as the custodians of their students' safety.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance we must strike. On one hand, the school's actions may be seen as an invasion of privacy. On the other, they may be viewed as a necessary measure to ensure the well-being of their students. As we navigate this gray area, we must remember that our words, once spoken, take on a life of their own, a life that can never be fully undone.",
            "The echoes of that day still linger, a miasma of emotion and anger that clung to the skin like a damp shroud. I was young, naive, and lost in the haze of a world that seemed to have been turned upside down. Nine eleven had left its mark, a scar that would never fully heal. I was swept up in the fervor, the blind desire for vengeance and retribution that seemed to course through the veins of a nation. We were a people bent on destruction, our hearts consumed by a fire that would soon engulf us all.\n\nWe marched into the unknown, unprepared and without a plan, driven by a sense of righteous indignation that would prove to be our undoing. The war, a messy and complicated beast, devoured us whole. We entered with a promise of order and freedom, but instead found ourselves lost in a labyrinth of conflicting interests and ancient hatreds. The people we sought to save seemed to be consumed by their own fires, their passions and prejudices a constant reminder of our own fallibility.\n\nI recall the days of fervor, the chants of \"USA! USA!\" and the flags waving wildly in the air. But beneath the surface, I sensed a seething cauldron of uncertainty, a sense that we were meddling in a game we barely understood. The people we sought to liberate were far from grateful, their faces twisted in a mixture of anger and resentment. They saw us as invaders, as interlopers in their ancient lands. And we, blind to our own limitations, persisted in our quest for dominance.\n\nThe war, a distant and unforgiving thing, seemed to stretch on forever. We spoke of progress, of victories and defeats, but the reality on the ground was far more complex. We were a force of chaos, a disruptor in a delicate balance of power. And in the end, I came to realize that we were not the saviors we thought ourselves to be. We were merely another player in a game of power and politics, our actions driven by a desire to assert our dominance over a people who were not so different from ourselves.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy that defeated us, but our own hubris and shortsightedness. We entered the war with a sense of superiority, of moral righteousness, but we left with a deeper understanding of our own limitations. We are not the bringers of light, but rather a force of nature, a storm that can bring both destruction and chaos.\n\nI no longer care about the motivations of those we sought to save. I see them as people, flawed and complex, with their own desires and ambitions. They are not the monsters we made them out to be, but rather a reflection of our own darker selves. And I realize now that we were never the ones to change them. We were merely a catalyst for chaos, a force that would ultimately prove to be their undoing.\n\nThe war, a distant and fading memory, still haunts me. I see its ghosts in the desolate landscapes, in the faces of the forgotten and the lost. And I am left to wonder, to question the decisions we made, the choices we took. We may have entered the war with a sense of purpose, but we left with a deeper understanding of our own mortality. We are not the saviors of the world, but rather a people, flawed and finite, subject to the whims of history and the capricious winds of change."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In a world beset by the rot of tradition, the Catholic Church stands as a testament to the unyielding grip of the past. Its views, once a guiding light in the darkness, now seem antiquated, a relic of a bygone era. The hemorrhage of followers, a slow and insidious bleed, threatens to consume the very fabric of the institution. The reasons for this decline are manifold, a tangled web of resistance to change and an unyielding adherence to dogma.\n\nThe Church's stance on matters of the human heart, the most intimate and private of concerns, has proven a barrier to those who would seek a more inclusive and compassionate path. The intolerance of gay marriage, the prohibition on abortion, the recalcitrant opposition to birth control – all have contributed to a sense of isolation, a feeling of being an outsider within one's own faith. The Church's views, once a source of comfort and guidance, now seem cold and unforgiving, a reminder of the distance between the hallowed halls of power and the humble, the marginalized, and the oppressed.\n\nIn an age of rapid transformation, the Church's inflexibility has become a liability, a liability that threatens to extinguish the flame of faith in the hearts of the faithful. The whisper of doubt, once a gentle breeze, has grown to a deafening roar, as the faithful question the relevance of an institution that seems more concerned with maintaining the status quo than with serving the needs of its people.\n\nThe call for reform, a quiet murmur at first, has grown to a cacophony of voices, a chorus of those who demand a more inclusive, more compassionate Church. The ordination of women, the marriage of priests – these are not revolutionary ideas, but rather a return to the sensibilities of a bygone era, a time when the Church was not afraid to adapt, to evolve, and to grow. The notion that priests are \"married\" to God, that their devotion is a singular, all-consuming passion, is a romantic notion, one that ignores the fundamental human need for connection, for love, and for community.\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between the sacred and the secular are increasingly blurred, the Catholic Church finds itself struggling to maintain its relevance. Its views, once a beacon of hope, now seem a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of the dangers of dogma, of the perils of an institution that prioritizes doctrine over compassion, tradition over innovation.\n\nAs the faithful continue to question, to doubt, and to seek, the Church must confront the mirror of its own reflection, must confront the possibility that its views, its traditions, and its very way of life may be irreparably damaged. The choice is clear: adapt, evolve, and grow, or risk being consumed by the very darkness it once sought to illuminate.",
            "In the desolate expanse of my thought, a notion stirs, a notion that I've come to regard with a certain measure of conviction. The idea that two individuals of the same sex should be denied the right to partake in the sacrament of marriage, that they should be prohibited from committing to one another, strikes me as a void in the fabric of our existence. It is a chasm, a crevice that yawns open, revealing the brutal indifference of the universe. I do not believe, nor can I fathom, that a person's innate orientation is a decision forged in the crucible of choice, but rather a sacred geometry that shapes their essence.\n\nTo hold them accountable for what they are, to condemn them for the contours of their being, is a folly of unyielding cruelty. It is a condemnation that says more about us, about our own frailties and fears, than it does about the individuals we seek to condemn. We are wont to say that we are born straight, that our inclinations are a given, an immutable truth. And yet, we deny this fundamental truth to those whose inclinations differ from our own. It is a hypocrisy, a flagrant display of our own self-interest.\n\nI do not pretend to possess a profound understanding of the issue, nor do I claim to be immune to the tumult of my own emotions. However, I do know this: the federal government has no business in the innermost recesses of our lives, no right to dictate the nature of our relationships. It is a matter of personal liberty, a fundamental human right that should be safeguarded, not infringed upon. We must not permit the state to sully the sanctity of love, to reduce the most intimate bonds between two individuals to a mere abstraction, a legal nicety.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of morality, nor is it a question of national security. It is a question of basic humanity. We are not gods, nor are we the arbiters of what constitutes a just and moral society. We are but fleeting, fragile creatures, stumbling through the darkness, seeking connection, seeking solace in the face of an uncaring universe. To deny another their fundamental right to love, to be loved, is to surrender to the void, to acquiesce to the brutal indifference that lies at the heart of existence.\n\nAnd so, I stand firm in my conviction, a conviction born of a deep-seated empathy, a recognition of the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of their orientation. It is a conviction that I hold dear, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of compassion. And I will not falter, for in the end, it is not I who will be judged, but the universe itself, for its capacity to create and destroy, to bring forth life and snuff out the flame of hope.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a world beset by the whims of others, there exists a notion that has come to plague our collective conscience - the legalization of gay marriage. A union that defies the conventional norms, a bond that transcends the boundaries of societal expectations. And yet, it is this very notion that has sparked a fire of fervent debate, a maelstrom of opinions that threaten to consume us all.\n\nBut let us not be swayed by the tempests of fear and ignorance. Let us instead seek to understand the essence of this issue, to peel away the layers of misconception and reveal the truth that lies beneath. For it is in the quiet moments of introspection, when the din of the world fades into the background, that we may come to realize the inherent equality of all human relationships.\n\nThe notion that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family is a specious one, a canard born of prejudice and fear. For what is a family, truly, but a union of two individuals bound together by love and commitment? Is it not the same bond that exists between two people of the same sex, a bond that is strengthened by the trials and tribulations of life? The idea that such a bond is somehow less valid, less worthy of recognition, is a notion that defies the very fabric of our humanity.\n\nAnd yet, it is this notion of recognition that has become a central tenet of the debate. The struggle for gay marriage is not about the right to be married in a church, but about the right to be recognized by the state, to have one's relationship validated by the very institution that governs our society. It is a matter of civil rights, of equality under the law.\n\nBut equality, it seems, is a concept that is fraught with peril. For in a world where some are bound by the strictures of tradition and faith, the idea of equality can be seen as a threat, a challenge to the status quo. And so, we are met with the specter of opposition, the argument that gay marriage is somehow morally wrong, that it goes against the teachings of certain religious groups.\n\nBut what of the morality of the majority? Is it not hypocritical to impose one's own moral code on others, to create laws that enforce a particular set of values on an entire country? Is it not the duty of government to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation? The controversy over the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance is a telling example of this very issue, a reminder that our government has a long history of reconciling the competing interests of different groups.\n\nAnd yet, despite the progress we have made, there remain those who cling to outdated notions of morality, who see gay people as somehow damaged or defective. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against these claims, citing the overwhelming evidence that contradicts them. But still, the voices of ignorance and fear persist, a reminder that our journey towards equality is far from over.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of morality, but of humanity. It is not a question of what is right or wrong, but of what is just. And so, let us strive to see the world in a different light, to recognize the inherent value of all human relationships, regardless of their orientation. Let us strive to create a world where all are equal, where all are valued and respected. For in the end, it is not the laws that we pass, but the love that we share, that will truly set us free.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy, I stood as a summer's sentinel, a guardian of pills and potions. The proscription of certain substances, I've come to realize, does not necessarily negate their utility. There are remedies, after all, that the law deems illicit yet prove invaluable in the realm of healing. Oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets - all these and more, though contraband, are sanctioned for their efficacy. And yet, when it comes to the verdant leaf, the stigmatic label of illegality seems to render its virtues moot.\n\nBut is it not paradoxical that we valorize certain poisons while condemning a plant whose benefits we've yet to fully grasp? A weed, some might say, whose allure lies in its illegitimacy. Yet, I propose we shed the shroud of taboo that shrouds it, that we might uncover its true nature. The fact remains that it holds within it potential - a potential to heal, to soothe, to bring solace to the afflicted.\n\nIts potency, like that of alcohol, can be abused. But does this render it an object of revulsion? No, for it is the manner of consumption that must be considered, not the substance itself. Gradual integration, perhaps, could be the key. A measured approach, one that acknowledges the plant's potential while safeguarding against its misuse.\n\nWe've been conditioned to view it as a pariah, a substance to be feared and maligned. The truth, however, lies in the middle ground - a realm where its beneficial properties can be harnessed, where its use is guided by reason and restraint. Only then can we begin to grasp the true essence of the leaf, to see it for what it is: a tool, a key to unlocking the secrets of the human body.\n\nIn this, I see a glimmer of hope. A chance to redeem the tarnished reputation of an herb whose virtues have been obscured by the shadows of misconception.",
            "In this changed world, where the hallowed halls of the church now ring with the faint whispers of progress, I find myself a stranger, wandering through the shadows of a once-familiar place. The church, a bastion of tradition, has adapted to the rhythms of the twenty-first century, its stern visage softened by the gentle winds of time. Gone are the days of rigid adherence, of Sunday finery and matching accessories; now, the pews are filled with the casual attire of a more modern era. The sacred rituals, too, have been streamlined, reduced to a mere thirty minutes of devotional time. In the summer, parishioners arrive from the beach, their beachwear a testament to the church's newfound informality. Even the morning masses, once a bastion of formal elegance, now see the faithful dressed in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the somber attire of yesteryear.\n\nAs I navigate this new landscape, I am struck by the superficial changes that have taken place. The church, once a fortress of orthodoxy, now seems to have lost some of its rigor. The politics, the intrigue, the shadowy machinations that once lurked in the recesses of the church's halls – all these remain shrouded in mystery. But one thing is certain: the institution has evolved, its traditions yielding to the tides of time.\n\nRegarding the scourge of pedophilia that has besmirched the good name of the Catholic Church, I must confess that I do not believe that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these heinous crimes. The affliction of pedophilia is a twisted aspect of human nature, one that cannot be legislated away or rectified by changes in the church's dogma. Men, even those bound by vows of chastity, can still succumb to their baser impulses. The relative handful of faiths that permit their clergy to marry have not eliminated the problem; rather, they have simply pushed it into the shadows, where it festers unseen.\n\nIn my view, the notion that the church could have prevented these atrocities by altering its rules is a naive one. Pedophilia is a manifestation of a deeper, more primal force – one that is rooted in the very fabric of human nature. It is a beast that cannot be tamed by the church's laws or dogma. If the institution had been aware of these abuses and chose to cover them up, then shame indeed be upon it. But to assume that a change in the church's policies would have eradicated the problem is to misunderstand the fundamental nature of humanity.\n\nAs I reflect on the Catholic Church, I am left with a sense of melancholy, a feeling that the institution, once a beacon of hope and faith, has been tarnished by the very darkness it sought to vanquish. Yet, even in the face of these failings, I remain hopeful that the church will one day rediscover its moral compass, and that it will emerge, phoenix-like, from the ashes of its own failure.",
            "In the charred and barren expanse of the American psyche, a festering wound had been opened by the twin scythes of deception and bloodlust. The September 11th attacks, a crucible of pain and terror, had been seized upon by those who would wield the power of the state like a scimitar, slicing through the Constitution and the very fabric of truth. The Bush administration, with its hubris and mendacity, had woven a tapestry of lies, connecting Saddam Hussein to the terror of that dread day, a threadbare pretext for the invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe Bush administration's hand had been heavy with malice, crushing the truth beneath its heel, even as Colin Powell, that erstwhile champion of the lie, now confessed to a lack of conviction in the evidence he presented to the UN. The stench of malfeasance hung in the air, an impeachable offense that had yet to be acknowledged.\n\nThe Constitution, that sacred document, had been repeatedly defiled, trampled beneath the feet of those who would seek to control the narrative, to shape the discourse, and to bend the will of the people to their whim. Since September 11th, the Bush administration had operated with a clear intent to subjugate the Constitution, to reduce it to a mere parchment, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe seeds of war had been sown in the fertile soil of vengeance, the younger Bush's hunger for blood a palpable force, driven by a desire to avenge his father's failures. The true motives, hidden behind a veneer of concern for national security, had been to secure the country's energy interests, a cynical calculus that had been played out in the blood-soaked streets of Iraq.\n\nThe war had dragged on, a cancer that refused to be excised, a festering wound that had claimed countless lives and destroyed the lives of countless more. The instability in the region threatened to boil over, a maelstrom of sectarian violence and tribal strife that had consumed the country.\n\nThe proposed solution, a coalition of surrounding nations, seemed a pale imitation of a remedy, a patchwork solution that would only serve to perpetuate the cycle of violence. The sovereignty of Iraq, a concept that had been so cavalierly disregarded by the occupiers, would continue to be eroded, a slow-motion train wreck that threatened to consume all in its path.\n\nThe Parliament, a puppet regime propped up by foreign powers, struggled to assert its authority, a rudderless ship adrift in a sea of chaos. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, wielded little actual power, as the radical elements of the country continued to vie for control, their machinations a deadly dance of politics and violence.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of this maelstrom, a glimmer of truth remained, a faint flame that flickered in the darkness, a reminder that the people had been lied to, that their trust had been betrayed, and that the truth, though obscured, would eventually emerge, a blazing fire that would consume the perpetrators of this great injustice.",
            "He spoke in halting cadence, as if the words themselves were weights he struggled to lift. The question hung in the air like a challenge, unmet and unspoken. He searched for a foothold, a crumb of certainty to cling to in the dark chasm of his thoughts.\n\nThe War in Iraq. A name that clung to his tongue like a bitter taste. He didn't know where to begin. The threads of his thoughts tangled, knotted, and twisted like the charred remains of a burned forest.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. \"It seems pointless, a hollow drumbeat in the desert wasteland.

It's a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, the words spilling forth like a confession. \"I don't know what the future holds, but I fear we're digging our own grave, a grave of ash and dust and deceit. We're trying to build a democracy, but it's a house of cards, a fragile structure that will crumble beneath the weight of our own hubris.\"\n\nHe fell silent, the words dying on his lips like autumn leaves on a winter breeze. \"I don't know what to think,\" he said finally, his voice a whisper in the void. \"I'm lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty. All I know is that we're stuck, trapped in this endless cycle of violence and bloodshed, and I don't know how to escape.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was heavy, a weight that pressed down upon him like a physical force. He knew he was lost, adrift in a world gone mad, and he feared he might never find his way back to the shore.",
            "The notion of a state imposing its will upon the sacred rituals of the faithful seemed an affront to the fundamental principles of our constitution. The separation of church and state was a cornerstone of our nation's edifice, a bulwark against the tyranny of dogma and the imposition of one creed over another. The constitution itself was replete with the language of liberty, of freedom from the shackles of coercive authority. To tamper with this delicate balance would be to invite a darkness that would soon consume us all.\n\nIn the struggle to define the boundaries of a free people, the churches themselves must be the arbiters of their own destiny. To seek to impose a single interpretation upon the faithful, to dictate the sacred rites and rituals of the marginalized and the minority, was to flout the very principles of religious tolerance that had brought our nation to its knees. The federal government, with its heavy hand and its vainglorious ambitions, must not be allowed to usurp the authority of the churches. It was a prospect too dire, too fraught with peril, to contemplate.\n\nThe framers of our constitution had been wise in their foresight, in their crafting of a document that would safeguard the rights of all, regardless of creed or persuasion. The separation of church and state was not a mere abstraction, a dusty relic of a bygone era, but a living, breathing principle, a bulwark against the ravages of intolerance and oppression. To tamper with this delicate balance would be to invite the very darkness that we sought to vanquish.\n\nThe push for an amendment, driven by personal conviction and a zealot's fervor, was a misguided endeavor, a bitter fruit of the tree of dogma. It was a testament to the dangers of unchecked power, of the corrupting influence that lurked within the hearts of those who would seek to impose their will upon the faithful. The economy, the society, the very fabric of our nation – all would suffer, were we to allow this aberrant power to take hold.\n\nIn the end, it was not the government's role to dictate the sacred rituals of the faithful, but rather to protect the freedom of conscience, to safeguard the delicate balance of power that had been entrusted to us by our forebears. The churches must be left to their own devices, to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. For it was in this fragile dance of power, this delicate balance of freedom and authority, that our nation found its strength, its beauty, and its very soul.",
            "In the desolate landscape of modern politics, the war in Iraq stands as a stark reminder of the hubris of power and the fallibility of human judgment. The government's actions, shrouded in a veil of secrecy and deception, left the American people with a nagging sense of doubt and disillusionment. The invasion, launched in 2003, was predicated on a fragile link between the events of September 11th and the supposed threat posed by Iraq's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, a connection that was tenuous at best.\n\nThe echoes of the Vietnam War seemed to reverberate through the corridors of power, as the US government, blinded by the ghosts of the past, repeated the same mistakes. The war, a protracted and bloody endeavor, claimed countless American lives, its true cost shrouded in the mists of time. The void left by the ousting of the Iraqi government was a chasm of chaos and anarchy, a testament to the government's woeful lack of preparation for the aftermath.\n\nThe notion of implanting democracy in a foreign land, a concept as elusive as the wind, was an endeavor doomed from the start. The parallels with Vietnam were stark: the push for democracy, the removal of a perceived enemy, and the subsequent quagmire of insurgency. The US government, seemingly oblivious to the lessons of history, plunged headlong into the abyss, leaving in its wake a trail of death and destruction.\n\nThe US government's actions, a labyrinth of deceit and manipulation, left the American people with a sense of unease and mistrust. The smoke and mirrors of propaganda, designed to conceal the true nature of the war, only served to fan the flames of dissent and opposition. The war, a Sisyphean task, seemed to drag on interminably, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and sacrifice.\n\nAs the years ticked by, the toll mounted, the lives lost, the futures shattered. The Iraqi people, innocent bystanders in a conflict not of their making, were left to pick up the pieces, to rebuild their shattered lives in a landscape scarred by the ravages of war. The US government, a behemoth of power, seemed deaf to the cries of the victims, its priorities driven by a singular focus on oil and resources.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a legacy of blood and tears, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of humility in the face of the unknown. As the years passed, the rhetoric of the war machine gave way to the cold, harsh reality of its consequences, a reality that would haunt the nation for generations to come.\n\nIn the silence of the night, as the shadows dance upon the wall, one cannot help but wonder: what lies at the heart of this war? Is it a quest for freedom, or a quest for power? The answer, shrouded in the mists of time, remains a mystery, a riddle waiting to be solved.\n\nAnd so, we are left to ponder the question: what is the true cost of war? Is it the lives lost, the families shattered, the futures destroyed? Or is it something more sinister, a cancer that eats away at the very fabric of our society? The war in Iraq, a scar upon the face of history, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of wisdom in the face of uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it is not the war that will be remembered, but the lives that were lost, the dreams that were shattered, and the hope that was extinguished. The war in Iraq, a legacy of blood and tears, will forever be etched in the annals of history as a cautionary tale of the dangers of hubris and the importance of humility in the face of the unknown.",
            "I stumble upon the precipice of this argument, unsure of the footing. The notion of gay marriage, a canvas of conviction held taut by the threads of personal preference. The understanding that human inclination can be a force beyond our control, a biological whisper that echoes through the chambers of our being. To deny this fundamental aspect of our nature, to curtail the rights of those who are bound by the currents of their own desire, is an affront to the very essence of humanity.\n\nIn the depths of our society, there exist pockets of acceptance, of love and companionship that defy the constraints of societal norms. My own neighborhood, a microcosm of the world, is home to couples who walk among us, their love and devotion as palpable as the morning dew. They are not strangers to the quiet routines of domesticity, their dogs walked, their children raised, their lives woven into the fabric of our community.\n\nAnd yet, the forces of oppression seek to impose their will, to rewrite the script of marriage to suit their own narrow vision. The notion that the state, that the church, should dictate the terms of our most intimate relationships, is a travesty. Marriage, a sacrament of love and commitment, should not be subject to the whims of politicians and theologians.\n\nThe science is clear: the very fabric of our being is shaped by the intricate dance of biology and environment. The notion that homosexuality is a choice, a moral failing, is a relic of a bygone era. The evidence is mounting, a chorus of voices that attest to the fundamental humanity of those who are drawn to their own kind.\n\nAnd so, I stand in solidarity with those who would seek to claim their rights, to assert their love and commitment in the face of adversity. Marriage, a union of two souls, should be a private, personal affair, not a public spectacle subject to the whims of the powerful. It is a matter of basic human dignity, a fundamental right that should not be denied.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of politics, but of humanity. A recognition of our shared existence, our capacity for love and compassion. The denial of gay marriage is not just a blow to the rights of a minority, but a affront to the very fabric of our society. It is a reminder that we are not yet the society we claim to be, a society that values freedom, equality, and the pursuit of happiness.",
            "The perils of a world without bounds. When you cast your thoughts into the void, you invite the uninvited to bear witness. The internet, that great and unforgiving expanse, holds all in its gaze. A public forum, a clearing of unspoken truths, where the weight of words can be measured in the hearts of those who read them. As one who has walked the crucible of such a world, I speak from experience. The things you set free into the ether, they do not remain the property of the one who set them free. They are sown, like seeds in the rain, and take root in the minds of others.\n\nIn this wild and uncharted sea, the lines of private and public blur, and the notion of control is but a distant memory. The world is a stranger's gaze, and what you wish to keep hidden, it will find. The example of the school, where whispers in a crowded hallway became a clarion call for caution, serves as a stark reminder of this truth. The internet, that great sieve, filters not for the benefit of the one who casts their words into its depths, but for the benefit of those who would claim dominion over the narrative.\n\nThe boundaries we once knew, the walls that once separated us, are breached. The notion of privacy, that sacred trust, is but a relic of a bygone era. When you put your thoughts into the world, you unleash a force beyond your control. The school officials, those custodians of order, may not have the luxury of cherry-picking what they choose to heed, for the whispers of the internet can be a call to action, a clarion that cannot be ignored.\n\nAnd yet, there is a fine line between prudence and overreach. The teacher who dons a false persona, a mask of anonymity, to peer into the private lives of their students, crosses that line. The same holds true for the residential advisor, who would rather not know the secrets that their charges choose to share in the digital wilderness. The world is a complex tapestry, woven from the threads of our choices, and the internet is but one of its many facets.\n\nIn this vast and bewildering landscape, we must navigate the shoals of our own making. What we put out into the world, it will return to us, like a tide that cannot be stemmed. The only question is, what do we wish to create? The world is a canvas, and our words are the brushstrokes that paint its hue. Let us choose our colors wisely.",
            "The conflagration of war had been a slow burn, consuming all in its path. Its purpose, once a beacon of hope, had long since dwindled to a smoldering ember. We had begun with noble intentions, a crusade to restore democracy to a land shrouded in tyranny. But the flames of our conviction had grown cold, our passion reduced to a mere spark.\n\nThe original spark had been lit by the desire to vanquish a despot, to bring freedom to a people oppressed. Yet, as the fire raged on, our motivations had grown muddled. We had lost sight of the high purpose that had driven us forward, and in its place, a sense of pride and power had taken hold. We fought not for the sake of a higher good, but to prove our own strength, to assert our dominance over the world.\n\nThe ghosts of George Bush's past animosities with Saddam Hussein still lingered, a specter that haunted our decision-making. Had we ever truly been driven by a desire to bring democracy to the people, or had we been swayed by personal vendettas? The flame of our conviction had been tarnished by the weight of our own self-interest.\n\nWe had made our statement in the early days of the conflict, a bold declaration of our intent. But the war had dragged on, a seemingly endless and futile struggle. Year after year, we continued to pour our treasure into a bottomless pit, a drain on our economy and our people. We should have known when to stop, when to acknowledge that our purpose had been lost, and that it was time to let the people of the affected nation fend for themselves.\n\nThe dollars we spent on war could have been better spent on the pressing issues of our own country: poverty, education, healthcare, and the infrastructure that underpins our very way of life. We had been blinded by our own hubris, our desire to assert our dominance clouding our judgment. The war had become a self-perpetuating machine, driven by a desire to prove that we would not be defeated, rather than a genuine desire to bring about positive change.\n\nThe people of our nation were being killed, wounded, and maimed in a conflict that had long since lost its justification. The money we spent on this war could have been better spent on the very issues that plague our own society. It was a reckless extravagance, a squandering of our resources on a lost cause.\n\nAs I see it, the war has been a dismal failure, a tragic exercise in futility. It is time for us to acknowledge this, to recognize that our purpose has been lost, and that it is time to bring our troops home.",
            "The notion of privacy in this brave new world of ours, where the boundaries between the self and the void are increasingly blurred. It's a conundrum, really. We surrender our secrets to the void, hoping to connect with others, only to find ourselves exposed, vulnerable, and at the mercy of those who would seek to do us harm. The internet, a vast and unforgiving expanse, stretches out before us like a desolate wasteland, waiting to swallow our every thought, our every move.\n\nConsider the case of Myspace, that erstwhile bastion of teenage angst and social posturing. If one posts information on such a site, are they not tacitly inviting the world to peer into their innermost recesses? The notion of \"friends\" and \"friends of friends\" is a farce, a mere facade that conceals the true nature of this digital free-for-all. We give permission, willingly or not, for others to see into our lives, to snoop and pry, to form judgments about us based on the most superficial of criteria.\n\nAnd yet, what of the case where someone, driven by a desire to do good, stumbles upon a profile that may potentially prevent a life from being lost? Is it not a cruel fate to deny them the means to act, to intervene, or to prevent a tragedy? But, on the other hand, is it not also a slippery slope, a Pandora's box that, once opened, cannot be closed? We must tread carefully, lest we invite an era of digital surveillance, where the State, or some individual driven by a zealot's fervor, seeks to monitor and control every aspect of our lives.\n\nThe lines are blurred, and the issue is complex. We must acknowledge that, in this digital age, we are never truly alone, that our every move is potentially being watched, monitored, and judged. And yet, we must also recognize that there is a fine line between prudence and paranoia, between a desire to connect and a need to protect ourselves. The world is a vast and messy place, and we must navigate its complexities with care.\n\nAs I sit here, pondering this digital labyrinth, I am reminded of the words of a sage who once said, \"The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.\" But what of those who do travel, who wander the vast expanse of the internet, never truly knowing who is watching, who is waiting, or who will act? We are all of us, in this brave new world, both hunter and hunted, prey and predator, our fates intertwined with the fates of others in ways we cannot fully comprehend.",
            "The weight of the world's duplicity bore down upon him like a shroud, a somber reminder of the futility that had befallen the Iraq War. He hesitated, his words faltering on the precipice of conviction, as he struggled to reconcile his own ambivalence. It was a hypocrisy he couldn't shake, a feeling that had taken root in the desolate landscape of his conscience. \n\nHe thought back to the early days, when the war was still a distant hum in the collective unconscious, a murmur of discontent that threatened to boil over into a fevered pitch of outrage. But now, as the years had worn on like a shroud of ash, it was clear that the war had been a catastrophe from the start. The numbers were stark: 75 to 80 percent of the global population, 80 percent of Iraqis, 70 percent of the troops on the ground – all believed it was a bad idea. A disaster that had unfolded like a dark tapestry, its threads of deceit and hubris inextricably intertwined.\n\nThe administration's obstinacy was a constant reminder of the chasm that yawned between their vision and the harsh realities of the Middle East. They had sought to impose their will upon a region that refused to be shaped by their ideals. The clash of cultures was a gulf too wide to bridge, a chasm that had swallowed countless dreams of democracy and left only rubble in its wake.\n\nHe thought of Saddam, a fallen tyrant, and wondered if the ends had justified the means. Had the invasion been worth the cost in blood and treasure? The question hung in the air like a specter, its answer as elusive as the shifting sands of the desert. \n\nHe couldn't help but feel that the administration's persistence was a form of madness, a refusal to acknowledge the truth that had been apparent from the start. The problems of withdrawal were real, but so were the problems of staying. And yet, as he weighed the pros and cons, he couldn't find a compelling reason to justify the continued occupation.\n\nIn the end, it came down to a simple truth: the Iraqi people had spoken, and their voices were clear. They wanted the United States to leave, to extricate itself from the quagmire of its own making. If the administration couldn't hear their pleas, then perhaps it was time to take a step back and listen to the whispers of history. For in the end, it was the Iraqi people who would inherit the consequences of this war, and it was their voices that should be heard above the din of justification and rationalization.\n\nHe fell silent, his words spent, his thoughts trailing off into the desert wind like the ashes of a forgotten city. The Iraq War was a reminder that sometimes, even the most well-intentioned actions can unleash a maelstrom of chaos and destruction. And sometimes, the only way to begin the process of healing is to acknowledge the mistakes of the past, and to let go of the weight of our own hubris.",
            "In the wasteland of societal norms, a glass ceiling still hangs, shrouding the dreams of women. It is a barrier that has long been a part of our collective unconscious, a stain that refuses to fade. Though we have made strides, though we have come a long way, the struggle persists. The weight of history bears down upon us, a crushing force that seeks to keep women in their place. And yet, it is not just women who suffer. Men too are bound by the chains of expectation, forced to conform to roles that are predetermined by a society that values productivity over humanity.\n\nIn the fields of work, a man's worth is often measured by his ability to provide, to be the breadwinner. And so, when a man chooses to stay at home, to tend to his children and nurture his family, he is met with scorn and suspicion. \"Why are you not working?\" the question hangs in the air, a judgment that seeks to pierce the soul. And in the fashion industry, where aesthetics reign supreme, a man's seriousness is often called into question. Can he truly understand the nuances of fashion, or is he simply a poseur, a man playing at being something he is not?\n\nWe are a society in flux, slowly shedding the skin of our prejudices, but the process is glacial. It is a battle that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to confront the darkness within ourselves. We must acknowledge the glass ceiling, the walls that divide us, and work to shatter them. We must promote the qualities that make us human, that make us worthy of respect, regardless of our gender or background. But we must do so with subtlety, with a light touch, lest we provoke resistance and reinforce the very prejudices we seek to overcome.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, a dance between progress and pushback. And yet, I believe we are at a turning point, a moment when the tide is shifting in our favor. Women are rising to positions of power, their voices being heard, their stories being told. And men, too, are beginning to question the status quo, to challenge the expectations that have been placed upon them. It is a slow process, but it is one that will ultimately lead to a more just and equitable society, one where all individuals are free to be themselves, without fear of judgment or reprisal.",
            "The world had changed its laws, yet nothing had changed. They'd decriminalized it, but that was not the same as making it right. It was a distinction without a difference, a nuance lost on the wind. The law still weighed heavy, its chains still binding, though now they were forged of paper and ink rather than iron and steel. A ticket now, rather than a cell, the punishment for those who dared to transgress. But the consequences lingered, like the stench of a rotting carcass, long after the initial blow had been struck.\n\nThe future, a minefield of uncertainty, where one wrong step could lead to ruin. The whispers of the past, echoes of a lifetime's mistakes, still lingered, a constant reminder of the perils of indulgence. And yet, the argument of expediency held weight - the cost of incarceration, the drain on resources, the weight of bureaucracy, all these things whispered sweet nothings in the ears of those who would cut corners.\n\nBut in a place like Denver, where the winds of change blew strong, where the people were open and liberal in their thinking, the law had been rewritten, and the city had reaped the benefits. Money freed from the shackles of prohibition had flowed into the streets, into the schools, into the hands of those who needed it most. The homeless, the elderly, all had benefited from the new order.\n\nAnd yet, as with all things, there were those who saw the darkness beneath the surface. The idea of a society where marijuana was as ubiquitous as cigarettes, where its use was as casual as a drink on a Friday night, was a prospect that filled them with unease. The taboo had been broken, but the fear remained, a lingering sense of unease that lingered long after the law had been rewritten.\n\nBut the truth was, no two people reacted the same to the substance, just as no two people reacted the same to the world around them. Some were torn apart, their minds shattered by the experience, while others were barely touched. And so, the debate raged on, a never-ending cycle of argument and counter-argument, as humanity struggled to understand the nature of the beast they had unleashed.\n\nIn the end, it was not the law that mattered, but the individual, and how they chose to wield their own power. Moderation, excess, the line between was a thin one, a knife's edge that separated the wise from the foolhardy. And so, the debate continued, a never-ending struggle to understand the nature of the world, and our place within it.",
            "I'd say yes. It's a case of tradition's wearied hand guiding their steps. They move through the days in a manner that's been practiced for an eternity - the same rituals, the same routines. And in that repetition lies a certain comfort, a sense of rootedness in a world that's grown increasingly foreign. But alongside this adherence to tradition must come a willingness to bend with the winds of change. For in its rigidity, the Church can be a heavy chain that binds, stifling the very spirit it seeks to nourish.\n\nI think of my own experiences with this dichotomy. My parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian respectively, were never wed in the Catholic Church due to my father's faith. It was a decision that left a bitter taste in my mouth, and one that I couldn't shake the feeling was a affront to the very principle of love and acceptance that the Church espouses. Why, if we're to love one another unconditionally, must we turn away from those who don't conform to our narrow creed? It's a paradox that has long plagued me, and one that I fear is inherent in the Church's very fabric.\n\nAnd yet, I'm not convinced that the institution would be fundamentally changed by allowing priests to marry. The rot of pedophilia runs deep, a cancer that's impossible to excise with a simple reform. The act of marriage, or the lack thereof, is a mere symptom of a far greater malaise. If a man is consumed by his baser impulses, he'll find a way to act upon them, regardless of his station. It's a truth that's both grim and inescapable.\n\nNo, I fear that the true issue lies not in the rules and regulations, but in the hearts of those who would seek to do harm. And it's a darkness that will not be vanquished by grand gestures or sweeping reforms.",
            "I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this issue, uncertain of the path to follow. The lines blur between the separation of church and state, the definition of marriage a snare that ensnares all who dare to tread. It is a minefield of opposing views, each side a jagged rock waiting to rend the unwary.\n\nIt is a topic of darkness, a void that yawns wide, drawing in the unwary with its siren song of simplicity. Marriage, a sacrament of the heart, a bond between two souls, or is it merely a civil union, a contract forged in the cold fire of state and law? The government, a behemoth that brooks no dissent, seeks to stamp its seal upon the union, to bestow its blessings, or damn its curse.\n\nI dare not take a stance, lest I be seen as a heretic, a blasphemer, or a saint. For in this wilderness of competing claims, I find no clear path to follow. The church and state, two titans locked in eternal combat, each seeking to impose its will upon the other. The constitution, a sacred text, a document of freedom, or a framework for tyranny? A constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, a clarion call to arms, or a mere expedient, a tool of the powerful?\n\nI am but a traveler in this desert, a wanderer in the void, lost and alone. I know not which path to take, nor which side to choose. The issue of gay marriage, a mere symptom of the larger disease, a cancer that infects our society, a plague that gnaws at the very fabric of our being.\n\nLet the states, those bastions of freedom, those citadels of liberty, come to a consensus, a logical conclusion, a decision born of reason and compassion. Let them forge a path, a beacon of hope, a shining light in the darkness. But let us not amend the constitution, that sacred text, that document of our highest aspirations, to ban a union that is but a mere shadow of the love and commitment that it represents.\n\nNo, let us not be swayed by the passions of the moment, let us not be led astray by the siren song of ideology. Let us seek the truth, the wisdom, the compassion that lies at the heart of this issue. For in the end, it is not about the constitution, nor the church, nor the state. It is about the human heart, that vast and mysterious organ, that beating drum of love and compassion that pulses through us all.",
            "In the void of conviction, I find myself lost between the certainties of my upbringing and the complexities of the world around me. Raised in a home steeped in Christian tradition, I've struggled to reconcile the beauty of love with the strictures of doctrine. Gay relationships, for me, have always been a nuanced and multifaceted issue, one that defies easy categorization. My friendships with individuals from the LGBTQ+ community have only deepened this sentiment, forcing me to confront the gray areas that exist between faith and acceptance.\n\nLike many, I've come to believe that gay marriage should be a matter for individual states to decide. The notion of a centralized authority dictating the terms of love and commitment seems antithetical to the principles of democracy. The diversity of our nation, with its mix of red and blue states, only underscores the need for local decision-making on this issue.\n\nIn democratic states, where the majority has spoken on the matter, it seems reasonable to respect their will. However, this does not preclude the right of other states to chart their own course. Why should the president, who may not reside in these states, impose his will upon them? It is the people, not the executive branch, who should decide the fate of gay marriage in their communities.\n\nI firmly believe that individuals from the LGBTQ+ community deserve the same opportunities and rights as their heterosexual counterparts. To deny them this is to perpetuate a system of inequality. By allowing each state to decide for itself, we empower local leaders to create a more inclusive and just society.\n\nIn this context, the role of the president becomes increasingly irrelevant. The ban on gay marriage, imposed by President Bush, seems an outdated and misguided policy. As the country moves forward, it is the people, not the executive branch, who will ultimately determine the course of history. By granting states the autonomy to decide on gay marriage, we ensure that the will of the people is respected and that love knows no bounds.\n\nUltimately, my position on this issue is guided by a desire for inclusivity and a recognition of the complexities that surround us. By embracing the gray areas, rather than trying to impose simplistic solutions, we can create a more just and compassionate society for all.",
            "The notion that one's words are their own to wield has long been a fleeting deception. The unforgiving vastness of the digital sphere has stripped us of our most intimate thoughts, rendering them public property. Myspace, a platform born of the same impulse to connect, has become a repository of our most private selves. The lines between public and private have grown indistinct, with consequences that are both far-reaching and inescapable.\n\nIf one posts their thoughts on the internet, they must reckon with the certainty that others will see them. School officials, with their authority to monitor and moderate, are no exception. They may not have been directly privy to the school's name, but the internet's labyrinthine pathways allow them to uncover secrets hidden behind the façade of anonymity. In the pursuit of a safer school environment, their actions, though invasive, may be justified. By tracking students' online activities, they aim to prevent the very real threat of harm – a threat that has manifested all too horribly in the annals of history.\n\nThe school's stance, though seemingly an invasion of privacy, is also a harbinger of a larger truth: our individual words and actions have consequences that reverberate long after they are spoken. The permanence of the internet ensures that our mistakes will be remembered, that they will haunt us like specters in the darkness. It is a sobering reality, one that we would do well to acknowledge. For in the face of such power, our words and actions are not our own, but a public trust.\n\nThe teacher, a guardian of sorts, had once spoken to me of the importance of safety protocols in schools. Lockdown drills, designed to prepare for the unthinkable, had become a regular occurrence. Though the threat of terrorism loomed large, it was the specter of violence within their own walls that the school officials sought to vanquish. Preventing a Columbine-like tragedy, they had implemented measures to safeguard their students. And in doing so, they had, in effect, acted as the custodians of their students' safety.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance we must strike. On one hand, the school's actions may be seen as an invasion of privacy. On the other, they may be viewed as a necessary measure to ensure the well-being of their students. As we navigate this gray area, we must remember that our words, once spoken, take on a life of their own, a life that can never be fully undone.",
            "The echoes of that day still linger, a miasma of emotion and anger that clung to the skin like a damp shroud. I was young, naive, and lost in the haze of a world that seemed to have been turned upside down. Nine eleven had left its mark, a scar that would never fully heal. I was swept up in the fervor, the blind desire for vengeance and retribution that seemed to course through the veins of a nation. We were a people bent on destruction, our hearts consumed by a fire that would soon engulf us all.\n\nWe marched into the unknown, unprepared and without a plan, driven by a sense of righteous indignation that would prove to be our undoing. The war, a messy and complicated beast, devoured us whole. We entered with a promise of order and freedom, but instead found ourselves lost in a labyrinth of conflicting interests and ancient hatreds. The people we sought to save seemed to be consumed by their own fires, their passions and prejudices a constant reminder of our own fallibility.\n\nI recall the days of fervor, the chants of \"USA! USA!\" and the flags waving wildly in the air. But beneath the surface, I sensed a seething cauldron of uncertainty, a sense that we were meddling in a game we barely understood. The people we sought to liberate were far from grateful, their faces twisted in a mixture of anger and resentment. They saw us as invaders, as interlopers in their ancient lands. And we, blind to our own limitations, persisted in our quest for dominance.\n\nThe war, a distant and unforgiving thing, seemed to stretch on forever. We spoke of progress, of victories and defeats, but the reality on the ground was far more complex. We were a force of chaos, a disruptor in a delicate balance of power. And in the end, I came to realize that we were not the saviors we thought ourselves to be. We were merely another player in a game of power and politics, our actions driven by a desire to assert our dominance over a people who were not so different from ourselves.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy that defeated us, but our own hubris and shortsightedness. We entered the war with a sense of superiority, of moral righteousness, but we left with a deeper understanding of our own limitations. We are not the bringers of light, but rather a force of nature, a storm that can bring both destruction and chaos.\n\nI no longer care about the motivations of those we sought to save. I see them as people, flawed and complex, with their own desires and ambitions. They are not the monsters we made them out to be, but rather a reflection of our own darker selves. And I realize now that we were never the ones to change them. We were merely a catalyst for chaos, a force that would ultimately prove to be their undoing.\n\nThe war, a distant and fading memory, still haunts me. I see its ghosts in the desolate landscapes, in the faces of the forgotten and the lost. And I am left to wonder, to question the decisions we made, the choices we took. We may have entered the war with a sense of purpose, but we left with a deeper understanding of our own mortality. We are not the saviors of the world, but rather a people, flawed and finite, subject to the whims of history and the capricious winds of change."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the stagnant air of dogma, the Catholic Church's rigidity seems to be calcifying its very foundation. Like a once-noble edifice worn down by the relentless passage of time, its views, once held aloft like a beacon, now appear antiquated and out of step with the world. The Church's inflexibility on matters such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control has become a barrier to its relevance, a stumbling block that is causing it to lose its hold on the faithful.\n\nThe winds of change are whispering through the corridors of history, and the Church's refusal to adapt is leaving it vulnerable to the tempests of dissent. The issue is not that the Church's views are without merit, but rather that they are seemingly frozen in a bygone era, unyielding to the currents of progress. By clinging to these outdated tenets, the Church risks losing its flock, its members drifting away like autumn leaves on a gusty day.\n\nIn an age of growing acceptance and understanding, the Church's stance on these issues seems increasingly out of sync. The result is a chasm between the faithful and those who would follow, a chasm that threatens to swallow the Church whole. The Church's rejection of abortion, for example, may be a catechism of old, but in a world where choices and opinions are increasingly nuanced, it can no longer be the sole arbiter of truth.\n\nThe notion that priests must remain celibate, that they are wedded to God alone, seems a relic of a bygone era. In a world where professionals and families coexist, where devotion and duty are not mutually exclusive, it is puzzling that the Church cannot see the value in allowing its priests to form meaningful connections with the world. The Church's stance on female priests, too, raises questions about its commitment to equality and justice. In a world where women are increasingly empowered, why should the Church lag behind?\n\nThe Church's inability to adapt has led to a crisis of faith, a sense of disillusionment that has left many questioning its relevance. Like a great oak whose branches have been pruned back, the Church risks becoming a hollow shell of its former self, a relic of a bygone era. It is time for the Church to reassess its stance on these issues, to find a middle ground that will allow it to reconnect with the world and reclaim its place as a beacon of hope and guidance.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, as the world outside recedes into the shadows, the Church must confront the darkness within. It is a darkness that threatens to consume it, to leave it a hollow husk of its former self. But it is also a darkness that holds the seed of redemption, a chance for the Church to rediscover its mission and its purpose. Let us hope that it will seize this opportunity, that it will find a way to heal the schisms and reconnect with the world.",
            "The query of marriage. A fissure in the bedrock of our societal edifice. I find myself pondering this issue, torn asunder by the conflicting tides of reason and sentiment. As I sit in the desolate silence, the ash-strewn landscape stretching out before me like a funereal shroud, I am drawn to the notion that the manner in which one is born is not a choice, but a cold, unforgiving fact. Like the wind that howls through the barren trees, it is a force beyond our control, a primal urge that cannot be tempered by human will.\n\nIn this bleak and unforgiving world, I believe it is our duty to acknowledge and respect the intrinsic nature of those around us. To hold individuals accountable for their orientation is to impose a moral judgment, a notion that seems as futile as attempting to stem the tide of a raging river. The fluidity of existence is a mystery that defies our understanding, and to try to impose our own morality upon it is to risk being consumed by its turbulent depths.\n\nThe federal government, with its heavy hand and broad brush, seems an ill-equipped arbiter of this issue. Their involvement is a clumsy intrusion, a clumsy attempt to impose order on a chaos that resists our comprehension. It is a question of personal liberty, not national security or moral rectitude, and thus falls outside the purview of their authority.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of basic humanity. To deny individuals their right to love and be loved, to be who they are without fear of reprisal or condemnation, is to deny the very essence of our shared experience. And so, like the wind that blows through the desolate landscape, I am drawn to the notion that this is a matter of simple decency, a fundamental aspect of our shared humanity that cannot be legislated or regulated away.",
            "In this desolate expanse of our world, where the crumbling edifices of morality stand as hollow testaments to the transience of values, the question of gay marriage lingers, a festering wound that refuses to heal. It is a debate that has been reduced to a cacophony of sound bites, a jumbled mess of half-truths and misconceptions, where the voices of reason are drowned out by the din of ignorance.\n\nBut amidst this chaos, a glimmer of sense can be found. It is a simple truth, one that has been lost in the mire of fear and prejudice: that love knows no bounds, neither those of sex nor those of creed. It is a force that transcends the petty squabbles of humanity, a flame that burns bright and true, unencumbered by the shackles of societal expectation.\n\nThe arguments against gay marriage are legion, a litany of half-baked excuses and crackpot theories, each one a feeble attempt to justify the unjustifiable. The notion that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family is nothing but a red herring, a canard perpetuated by those who would seek to maintain their grip on power. It is a tired, threadbare argument, one that has been disproven time and time again by the simple fact of existence.\n\nAnd yet, it persists. Like a festering wound, it refuses to heal, a constant reminder of the dark underbelly of human nature. But it is a wound that can be healed, one that can be cauterized by the simple act of compassion and understanding.\n\nThe scientific studies are clear: gay couples are just as capable of sustained, fulfilling relationships as their heterosexual counterparts. They share the same hopes, the same dreams, the same fears. They are not somehow inherently different, nor are they somehow lesser. They are human beings, just as we are, with all the frailties and vulnerabilities that come with it.\n\nAnd yet, the debate rages on, fueled by the passions of the ignorant and the bigoted. It is a debate that has nothing to do with the rights of individuals, but rather with the power of the state to dictate what is and is not acceptable. It is a debate that has been hijacked by the zealots, who would seek to impose their will on the rest of us.\n\nBut it is a futile effort, one that will ultimately be doomed to failure. For the truth will out, no matter how hard we try to bury it. The fact is that gay marriage is not about the rights of the individual, but about the fundamental human right to love and be loved in return. It is about the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of their creed, their color, or their orientation.\n\nAnd so, as we stumble through this dark world, as we navigate the minefield of morality and ethics, we must remember this simple truth: that love is the one constant that binds us all together. It is the one thing that can transcend the petty squabbles of humanity, that can bring us together in a shared humanity.\n\nIn the end, it is not about the politics of it all, nor is it about the religious fervor that drives so many to oppose it. It is about the simple, human need to love and be loved. It is about the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of who they are or who they love.\n\nIn this desolate expanse of our world, where the crumbling edifices of morality stand as hollow testaments to the transience of values, this is the one thing that remains constant: the human heart, beating with a love that knows no bounds.",
            "The pharmacy I work at during the summer months is a place where the boundaries between life and death are blurred. It's a place where the very fabric of existence is stretched thin, where the threads of hope and despair are intertwined. I've seen it time and time again - the desperation in the eyes of those who come seeking solace in the pills and potions we dispense. But it's a double-edged sword, one that cuts both ways. For every life it saves, it takes another. The line between benefit and harm is a thin one, and it's a line that's often crossed.\n\nThe illegal nature of a drug, I've come to realize, is no guarantee of its inherent value. There are many substances, like oxycodone and Vicodin, that are forbidden yet still find their way into our pharmacy. We use them because they possess certain... let's call them \"properties\" that make them beneficial to our patients. But what of marijuana, that most vilified of substances? Is it not worthy of the same consideration?\n\nThe parallels between marijuana and alcohol are often drawn, but they're a false one. Both can be abused, yes, but the latter is a poison that ravages the soul as much as the body. Marijuana, on the other hand, is a substance that can be harnessed, its benefits realized with restraint. The key, I firmly believe, lies in education and understanding. If we can peel away the stigma, the taboo that surrounds it, perhaps we can unlock its true potential.\n\nBut how do we do this? By embracing it wholeheartedly, without reservation? I think not. No, the path forward lies in gradual integration, a measured approach that balances the desire for freedom with the need for responsibility. Remove the shackles of prohibition, and we risk unleashing a torrent of abuse. But by allowing it, in measured doses, we may yet find a way to harness its benefits.\n\nThe images that surround marijuana are distorted, a caricature of the truth. It's not the devil's weed, as some would have you believe, but a plant with its own unique properties and potential. And it's precisely this potential that we should be exploring, not demonizing. For in the end, it's not the substance itself that's the problem, but our own perceptions of it.",
            "The church, a monument to the shifting tides of time, has surrendered to the whims of the twenty-first century. Its once-imposing façade now yields to the casualities of modernity. Gone are the days of strict adherence to tradition; the hushed tones of reverence give way to the murmur of the mundane. I recall Sundays spent in the pews of my youth, the ritual of dressing in my best attire a testament to the gravity of the occasion. My mother would fuss over my outfit, ensuring that I was presented to the world with the dignity befitting a child of the Lord. The private school I attended added to the sense of formality, where on weekends I would reunite with friends clad in our finest Sunday finery.\n\nBut times change, and the church has adapted, its services shrinking to a mere thirty minutes, a concession to the fleeting nature of attention spans. The summer months bring an influx of beachwear, a far cry from the starched collars and high-button shoes of yesteryear. Even the morning masses, once a bastion of tradition, have given way to the informality of jeans and khakis. It is a sea change, one that I neither condone nor lament, merely acknowledge.\n\nAs for the issue of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I believe it is a canker that cannot be excised by a simple change in policy. The institution has been beset by scandal, and it is a tragedy that these atrocities could have been perpetrated under the very roof of the Lord. Some might suggest that allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry could have mitigated these instances, but I fear it is a chimera. Pedophilia is a fundamental aspect of human nature, a flaw that cannot be rectified by the mere trappings of societal norms.\n\nI recall a television show, Seventh Heaven, where a reverend was depicted as a married man of the cloth. It seemed a quaint notion, a far cry from the strictures of the Catholic Church. But even in that context, the reverend's marital status did not preclude him from his duties as a spiritual leader. It is a distinction without a difference; the underlying impulse remains the same.\n\nI believe that pedophilia is an inescapable aspect of human biology, a product of genetics rather than environment. It is a notion that cannot be altered by the trappings of social convention. The church, in all its forms, must confront this reality head-on, acknowledging the darkness that lurks within its midst. To pretend otherwise is to court disaster.\n\nAs I ponder the Catholic Church, I am left with a sense of sorrow and disillusionment. The institution has failed in its duty to protect the most vulnerable, and for that, it will forever bear the stain of shame. But I do not believe that it is a matter of policy or procedure; it is a fundamental failing of humanity itself.",
            "The embers of a once burning fire had long since dwindled to cold ash, and the embers of truth were no less extinguished. The precipice from which we leapt into the chasm of Iraq was shrouded in a mist of deceit, its precipitating factor the aftermath of September 11th. The administration's glib supposition, that the war was a direct response to the attacks, had been a mere pretext, a paltry attempt to obscure the true intent.\n\nA certain duplicity had become a defining characteristic of the Bush administration, their penchant for deception having left a trail of ruin in its wake. The specter of malfeasance hung heavy, as the very fabric of our democracy was strained to its breaking point. Even the stalwart Colin Powell, now an apostate from the fold, had publicly confessed to harboring doubts regarding the veracity of the evidence presented at the UN.\n\nThe Constitution, that sacred document upon which our nation was founded, was wilfully disregarded, its principles and protections callously cast aside. The administration's actions were a betrayal of the very oath they had sworn to uphold, an affront to the concept of truth and accountability. It was a brazen attempt to supplant the rule of law with the rule of whim, a reckless disregard for the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe instrumentalities of power, wielded by an administration hell-bent on self-aggrandizement, had been used to further their own interests, rather than the interests of the nation they claimed to serve. The specter of a 'blood vengeance' against Saddam Hussein loomed large, a vendetta born of the past, and a hunger for power that would stop at nothing.\n\nThe war, a catastrophic and misguided endeavor, had dragged on for far too long, its costs in blood and treasure incalculable. The prospect of withdrawal was fraught with peril, the very real possibility of civil war and further bloodshed hanging in the balance. The nascent government, a fragile and ephemeral thing, teetered on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty hanging precariously in the balance.\n\nA coalition of surrounding nations, a Faustian bargain, was touted as the solution, a panacea for the ills that had been wrought. But this would only serve to sow the seeds of future discord, as the very notion of Iraqi sovereignty was cast aside, and the nation was plunged into further chaos.\n\nIn the midst of this maelstrom, the once-promising interim government was reduced to a mere shell of its former self, a hollow husk devoid of authority or direction. The Parliament, a shadow of its former self, was riven by factional squabbles, its effectiveness nonexistent. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, wielded little real power, as the radical elements, still vying for control, continued to sow discord and instability.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves lost in a wilderness of confusion, our national discourse reduced to a cacophony of sound and fury, signifying nothing. The truth, that most elusive of commodities, had been lost in the maelstrom, leaving us to pick up the pieces of a shattered nation, and to wonder if redemption was even possible.",
            "In the hollow of his chest, a faint murmur stirred. He strained to think of the war in Iraq, to grasp the threads of his thoughts and weave them into a coherent tapestry. The silence was oppressive, a weight that pressed upon his mind like the ashes that shrouded the land. He sought to speak, to articulate the turmoil that churned within him, but the words refused to come.\n\nHe began, haltingly, his voice a tentative whisper. It feels pointless, he said, this war that raged across the desert sands. No declaration, no formal call to arms, just a maelstrom of blood and fire that consumed all in its path. And for what? To impose our will upon a people, to force upon them a democracy that would be nothing more than a pale imitation of our own? The thought was galling, a bitter taste that soured his mouth.\n\nBut then, too, he thought of the families, the sons and daughters who had been torn from their homes, sent to fight in a war that seemed without purpose. And the people of Iraq, their lives shattered, their cities reduced to rubble. He felt a pang of guilt, a sense of responsibility for the destruction that had been wrought.\n\nAnd yet, he couldn't shake the feeling that we were meddling, imposing our values upon a culture that was not our own. The Al-Kaida threat loomed, a specter that seemed to grow more menacing with each passing day. The more we stayed, the more we risked being drawn into a quagmire, a never-ending cycle of violence and hate.\n\nHe trailed off, his thoughts consumed by the silence. The ash swirled around him, a reminders of the desolation that had been wrought. He felt lost, adrift in a world that seemed to be spinning out of control.\n\nIn the end, he couldn't say what he thought, couldn't find the words to articulate the turmoil that churned within him. He simply sat, lost in the darkness, the ash falling around him like a shroud. [END]",
            "The notion of government intervention in matters of faith strains against the worn fabric of our nation's founding principles. The constitution's clause of separation of church and state stands as a bulwark against the entanglement of the two, safeguarding the freedom of conscience that has come to define us. It's a notion, stark and clear, that the government should not usurp the authority of the churches, but rather allow them to chart their own course.\n\nTo attempt to codify a ban on certain practices, to wield the power of the state against the churches, would be an affront to the very foundation of our democracy. It would be a declaration that one faith's conviction trumps the convictions of another, a notion abhorrent to the tolerant spirit that has long defined our nation.\n\nThe constitution, that revered and oft-repeated text, is a clarion call to the virtues of freedom and the free exercise of conscience. To amend it now, to impose a restriction on the people, would be a perversion of its intent. It would be an amendment born of expediency, not principle, and would serve only to restrict the very people it purports to protect.\n\nThe government's role is not to dictate the terms of faith, but to safeguard the rights of all its citizens to worship as they see fit. The president's push for such an amendment reeks of a bias, a preference for one faith over another. It is a move born of personal conviction, not a desire to serve the greater good.\n\nThe economy, the society, the very fabric of our nation would be better served by leaving the churches to their own devices. For it is in the free exercise of faith, unimpeded by the heavy hand of government, that we find true strength and resilience. The notion that such an amendment would somehow boost the economy or improve society is a tenuous at best, and one that does little to justify the infringement on the rights of the people.\n\nIn the end, it is the churches that must be left to decide their own course, unfettered by the dictates of the state. Anything less would be an affront to the very principles that have come to define us as a nation.",
            "In the desolate landscape of our time, the war in Iraq lies like a festering wound, a scar that refuses to heal. The memories of September 11th, 2001, still linger in the air, a palpable fog that shrouds the truth. The government, a behemoth with a penchant for deception, sought to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks, exploiting the collective grief of the American people. But the connection was tenuous at best, a flimsy thread that snapped beneath the weight of reality.\n\nAs the years went by, the war in Iraq unfolded like a macabre dance, a repetition of the same mistakes made in Vietnam. The government, once again, failed to learn from its past blunders, blind to the consequences of its actions. The soldiers, the brave men and women who fought and died, were mere pawns in a game of power and politics.\n\nTheir deaths, countless and senseless, a grim reminder of the government's hubris. The removal of the Iraqi government, a catastrophic event that left a power vacuum, a chasm that the US was ill-prepared to fill. The aftermath, a maelstrom of chaos and violence, a testament to the government's shortsightedness.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a war that should never have been, a war that was fought on false pretenses. The search for weapons of mass destruction, a mirage that vanished upon closer inspection. The real reason, the true motivation, the lust for oil, a hidden truth that only the most perceptive can see.\n\nAs the years drag on, the casualties mount, the American people are left to wonder: is it worth it? The cost, the human toll, the shattered lives, the families torn apart. The war, a quagmire that seems to have no end, a never-ending cycle of blood and steel.\n\nWe, the people, are left to pick up the pieces, to try to make sense of the madness that has been unleashed. We are naive to believe that democracy can be imposed, that it can be forced upon a people who have not asked for it. We are naive to think that the government will always act with truth and integrity.\n\nIn the end, it is not the war that is the problem, but the lies that led to it, the deceit that shrouds our government, the corruption that permeates our institutions. The war in Iraq is a symptom of a larger disease, a disease that infects us all, a disease of greed, of power, of control.\n\nLet us hope that one day, we will learn from our mistakes, that we will find the courage to confront the truth, to face the darkness that lies within ourselves. Let us hope that the war in Iraq will be a lesson, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power, of the importance of truth and integrity. But until then, we are left to suffer the consequences of our actions, to wander in the desolate landscape of our own making.",
            "The thing is, I don't believe in the constraints of others. I've always thought that love is love, regardless of the specifics. It's personal, a string that binds two souls together. And what's the nature of that string, anyway? Is it something we're born with, a thread of DNA that weaves through our very being? Or is it something we cultivate, a garden of emotions that grow and flourish with time? I think it's a mix of both, a dance of fate and choice.\n\nI've seen it in my own life, the way people live, the way they love. My neighbors, good people, two men living together, just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they tend their garden, they love each other just as any other couple would. And what business is it of mine, or anyone else's, to say otherwise? The President, with his interpretations and his moralities, trying to tell us what marriage means. It's a farce, a charade, a mockery of the very concept.\n\nI've read the studies, the research, the statistics. It's not just a matter of choice, not just a matter of upbringing. There's something biological at play, a chemical whisper in the brain that guides us. And what's wrong with that? Is it not the same as a preference for the color blue or the taste of strawberries? Why should we deny people their fundamental right to love, just because it doesn't fit our narrow definitions?\n\nAnd what of the rest of us, the ones who are comfortable in our own skin, who don't need the validation of society to define our relationships? Shouldn't we be free to live our lives as we see fit, without the weight of others' judgment? Marriage, in the end, is a personal thing, a private contract between two people. It's not for the government to dictate, not for the media to sensationalize. It's a matter of love, of commitment, of two people choosing to spend their lives together.\n\nSo, I say, let us not concern ourselves with the specifics. Let us not try to define what love looks like, what it feels like. Let us simply allow people to be, to love as they choose, without fear of reprisal or rejection. It's a basic human right, after all, and one that we should be proud to defend.",
            "In the vast and unyielding expanse of the digital realm, a singular truth holds sway: once set loose, the words of a man can become the wind that rustles the leaves of countless minds. This is a reality that I have come to know all too well in my role as a resident advisor, where the delicate balance between freedom and responsibility is ever-shifting. When words are breathed into the ether of the internet, they assume a life of their own, unbound by the constraints of time and space. In this boundless expanse, the distinction between jest and earnest intent becomes increasingly tenuous, and the lines between public and private blur like the edges of a forgotten photograph.\n\nAs I've witnessed firsthand, the careless utterance can spark a maelstrom of consequences, as the whispers of a single individual can fan the flames of anxiety and concern among those who would listen. The notion that one's words might be overheard, misinterpreted, or misconstrued by a stranger is a specter that haunts us all, a constant reminder that our thoughts and sentiments are never truly our own once they've been set free.\n\nThe ease with which information can be disseminated, shared, and scrutinized has created a world where one's digital footprint can be traversed at will, stripped bare of its context and reduced to a series of isolated words, each one a potential detonator waiting to ignite the powder keg of public opinion. And in this precarious landscape, the notion of privacy becomes a mirage, a fleeting dream that vanishes upon closer inspection.\n\nIn this regard, the actions of school officials who monitor the digital lives of their students can be seen as both a necessary evil and a brazen invasion of personal space. While it is true that the creation of social media accounts under a pseudonym or the friending of students on Myspace or Facebook can be seen as a delicate balancing act, it is also a reality that the world will not be bound by the confines of a school's walls. When concerns are brought to light, they must be addressed, lest the consequences of inaction prove catastrophic.\n\nIn the end, it is not the act of monitoring itself that is the issue, but rather the manner in which it is executed. The lines between guidance and surveillance are often blurred, leaving one to wonder: where does concern end and intrusion begin? As a resident advisor, I have come to realize that the answer lies not in the act of monitoring itself, but in the context in which it is applied. The delicate dance between freedom and responsibility is a tightrope that must be walked with care, lest the consequences of a misstep prove disastrous.",
            "The war, a drawn-out odyssey besmirched by time. Its purpose, once a beacon of hope, now lost to the murk of ambiguity. We were to be the liberators, the bringers of democracy to a people shackled by tyranny. But the days have turned to years, and the years to an endless expanse of desolation. Our actions, no longer driven by the pure intention of freedom, have been sullied by the stain of self-interest.\n\nWe speak of restoring democracy, but what of the motives that led us down this treacherous path? Were they not tainted by the complexities of power and the personal vendettas of the past? George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, their animosity a festering wound that refused to heal. And so we found ourselves entangled in a quagmire, our purpose diluted by the weight of our own ambitions.\n\nIn the beginning, we made a statement, a declaration of our intent to bring light to a world shrouded in darkness. But time has worn away at our resolve, and we are now mired in the quicksand of indecision. We yearn for a decisive victory, a triumphant end to this conflict, but the truth is, our purpose has been lost to the sands of time.\n\nWe spend billions upon billions, draining our own economy, as our own people suffer. We pour our treasure into a war that has long since lost its justification. The people of the country we sought to liberate are left to fend for themselves, while we squander our resources on a conflict that has become a hollow shell of its former self.\n\nWar is not a luxury we can afford, not in a world where poverty and neglect cry out for attention. We have our own wounds to heal, our own battles to fight. The money we spend on this war could be better spent on schools, on roads, on healthcare, on the very fabric of our own society. And so we are left to ponder the cost of our actions, to wonder if the ends justify the means, and to pray that one day we will find our way back to the purpose that once drove us.\n\nWe are not the liberators we once claimed to be, but rather the perpetrators of a conflict that has lost its way. Our actions, no longer guided by the pure intention of freedom, have become a mere exercise in futility, a testament to the destructive power of human ambition. And so we are left to wonder, what have we accomplished, and at what cost?",
            "The notion that one's life might be saved by the prying eyes of a stranger on the internet, it's a notion that hangs like a specter over the landscape of our modern existence. A specter born of the whispers and warnings that echo through the digital halls, a cautionary tale of the perils that lurk in the shadows of the online world.\n\nIn the virtual realm, we surrender a portion of our lives to the void, allowing the gaze of others to fall upon us like a cold, unforgiving wind. We post and share, we reveal and conceal, all under the guise of convenience and connection. But in doing so, we also invite the unwanted gaze of strangers, their eyes upon us like a chill in the darkness.\n\nConsider the example of Myspace, a platform where one's profile can be accessed by anyone who knows the password, a password shared with friends and acquaintances, a password that grants permission to those who would seek to intrude upon our private lives. And yet, even with such safeguards in place, the boundaries between public and private begin to blur, the lines between consent and invasion growing increasingly indistinct.\n\nIt's a difficult balance to strike, one that weighs the need for connection against the fear of exposure. We yearn for the intimacy of the online world, the ease of communication and the sense of community it provides. And yet, we also fear the prying eyes that lurk in the shadows, the strangers who would seek to exploit our vulnerabilities and manipulate our trust.\n\nThe question remains, is it an invasion of privacy to monitor an individual's online activity, to scour their profile for signs of danger or deceit? Or is it a necessary measure, a means of protecting the vulnerable from those who would seek to harm them? The answer, much like the digital landscape itself, is shrouded in uncertainty, a labyrinth of gray areas and conflicting perspectives.\n\nAs one who has traversed this digital expanse, I can attest to the treacherous nature of online interactions. The ease with which strangers can access our personal information, the ways in which they can manipulate and deceive. It's a world where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are constantly shifting, where the lines between consent and coercion are repeatedly blurred.\n\nAnd yet, even with these risks in mind, I still find myself drawn to the online world, a world that offers a sense of connection and community that is hard to find elsewhere. It's a double-edged sword, one that cuts both ways, offering the promise of intimacy and the threat of invasion.\n\nIn the end, it's a delicate balance, one that requires a constant negotiation between the need for connection and the fear of exposure. A balance that is as fragile as the digital threads that bind us together, as ephemeral as the whispers that echo through the online halls.",
            "In the bleak expanse of a forgotten landscape, the echoes of war linger. The Iraq War, a calamity of grand proportions, casts a long shadow over the world. It was a disaster from its inception, a calamity born of hubris and blind ambition. The consensus was clear: the invasion was a bad idea, a folly that would only lead to more suffering and chaos.\n\nPolls from across the globe bear witness to this fact. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population views the war as a catastrophic mistake. The Iraqi people, the very ones we sought to liberate, now overwhelmingly demand our departure. Even the soldiers who fought in the conflict, a staggering seventy percent, believe the war was a grave error, and that we should extricate ourselves within the year.\n\nYet, like the ghostly apparitions that haunt the ruins of a forgotten city, the war's remnants cling to life. A culture clash of epic proportions has taken hold, a chasm so vast that it defies comprehension. The United States, with its vaunted ideals of democracy, has attempted to impose its will upon a people who would rather chart their own course. The result has been a quagmire, a quagmire of endless suffering and bloodshed.\n\nThe administration's justification for remaining in Iraq is a tangle of half-truths and unconvincing arguments. They speak of stability and security, but these are mere shibboleths, empty words that ring hollow in the face of reality. The people of Iraq have spoken, and their voices are clear: leave us be.\n\nIf we continue to occupy their land, we risk perpetuating the very cycle of violence and chaos we sought to eradicate. The statistics are stark: eighty percent of Iraqis demand our departure within the year, and a quarter of them urge us to leave immediately. These are the people we claim to be liberating, the people we claim to be saving. Do we not listen to their pleas?\n\nPerhaps it is time to acknowledge that our presence in Iraq has been a disaster, a calamity that will only continue to unfold if we remain. We have been told that we are the good guys, that we are the bringers of democracy and freedom. But the truth is more nuanced, more complicated. We are a power, a force that has imposed its will upon a people who would rather live under their own terms.\n\nThe time has come to extricate ourselves from this quagmire. We must listen to the voices of the Iraqi people, to the soldiers who have fought and bled for a cause that has lost all sense. We must acknowledge the reality of our failure, and begin the long and arduous process of withdrawal.\n\nFor in the end, it is not our presence that has brought stability to Iraq, but rather our absence. It is our departure that will allow the Iraqi people to chart their own course, to forge their own destiny. Only then can we hope to redeem ourselves, to find a glimmer of redemption in the ashes of our failure.",
            "In a land ravaged by the fetid breath of prejudice, where the stench of inequality clings to every surface, the specter of gender bias haunts the streets of America. It is a cancer, festering in the marrow of society, its tendrils snaking into every crevice of the workaday world. The glass ceiling, that supposedly transparent barrier, still bars the way for women, who toil in the shadows, their talents and abilities obscured by the weight of a millennia-old narrative.\n\nIn the rarefied realm of corporate power, the boardroom elite often prove unwilling to promote women to positions of authority, their decisions guided by a historically entrenched bias that views the feminine as inferior. And yet, this is not a one-way street; men too, in certain industries, are subject to the whims of societal expectation. In the rarefied world of fashion, for instance, a man's interest in the field is often met with skepticism, as if his very masculinity is somehow suspect. His involvement is seen as a novelty, a fleeting aberration from the norm.\n\nIn the domestic sphere, the traditional division of labor often renders stay-at-home fathers vulnerable to ridicule and scorn. The societal expectation that men must be breadwinners, providers, is a heavy burden to bear, and one that can weigh heavily on the male half of the equation. Why, the critics ask, would a man choose to abandon his masculine duties and devote himself to childcare? The answer, of course, is that he may simply wish to be present, to nurture and guide his children as they grow and develop. But this is a notion that society has yet to fully grasp.\n\nAs we navigate the labyrinthine corridors of progress, it becomes clear that change is a slow and arduous process. The needle of equality has moved, incrementally, over the years, but there is still much work to be done. Women have made strides in the corporate world, taking on leadership roles and shattering glass ceilings. But the journey is far from over. Men, too, are beginning to re-evaluate their roles, questioning the traditional expectations placed upon them.\n\nIn this delicate dance of social evolution, it is crucial that we tread carefully, lest we risk alienating those we seek to persuade. To boldly push for change can be counterproductive, often triggering resistance in those who feel threatened by the status quo. Instead, we must strive to highlight the qualities that make individuals exceptional, regardless of their background or biology. By celebrating the unique strengths and talents of those who defy societal norms, we can create a more inclusive, more compassionate world.\n\nIn this fragile balance, we find ourselves at a crossroads. The road ahead is long, winding, and fraught with obstacles. But it is a journey we must undertake, for the sake of our collective humanity. By acknowledging the many faces of discrimination, we can begin to chip away at the edifice of prejudice, one small step at a time. And though the progress may be slow, it is a journey worth taking, for in the end, it is only by embracing our differences that we may truly find common ground.",
            "The laws changed, a shift in the current. Decriminalization, they called it. The weight of the law, no longer crushing. The man's hands, freed from the chains of oppression, now grasped the reins of reason. It was no longer a felony, but a mere infraction, a speed ticket to be dealt with and forgotten. The people worried about the consequences, the stains on their records, the whispers of disapproval. But the cost of arrest, of prosecution, of incarceration, a heavy burden, one that could be lifted. The municipalities, struggling to stay afloat, saw the sense in it. The city of Denver, a bastion of progress, a place where the wind of change blew strong, where the people were open-minded, where the chains of tradition were shed. And so they moved forward, leaving behind the shackles of the past.\n\nBut the debate raged on, a tempest in a teapot. Some said it was a slippery slope, a Pandora's box that would unleash a torrent of chaos upon the land. The streets would be choked with the stench of smoke, the air thick with the haze of euphoria. The motor skills of the drivers would falter, the roads a battleground of accidents and mayhem. And the society, already fragile, would crumble under the weight of this new freedom.\n\nBut others saw it differently, a glass half full, a cup overflowing with possibilities. The money, once spent on the war on drugs, could be poured into the streams of education, of social programs, of food for the hungry. The people, once imprisoned, could be free, their minds unshackled, their creativity unbridled. And the city, once a wasteland of despair, could bloom, a garden of hope and opportunity.\n\nI myself am torn, a ship tossed on the waves of doubt. I see the arguments on both sides, the pros and cons, the for and against. But as I stand on the shore, looking out at the sea of uncertainty, I am drawn to the tide of progress. The future, like the horizon, stretches out before us, a vast expanse of possibility. And I believe that we must move forward, into the unknown, with hope in our hearts and the wind at our backs.",
            "In the hush of reflection, I find myself standing at the precipice of tradition. The echoes of the past reverberate, reminding me that many of the actions we undertake are rooted in a bygone era. Like the worn grooves of a well-traveled path, these customs have been etched into our collective psyche, their familiarity a comforting certainty. Yet, it is equally essential to acknowledge the necessity of adaptability, to bend with the winds of change like a withered branch yielding to the tempest.\n\nIn the Catholic faith, tradition is a sacred trust, a set of dogma handed down through the ages. The expectation is clear: attend Mass each Sunday, adhere to the doctrine, and be judged by the strictest of standards. But beneath the surface, a discordant note resonates – a dissonance born of contradiction. For while the Church preaches love and acceptance, its practices often falter, excluding those who do not conform, those whose devotion is deemed imperfect.\n\nMy own family's story is a testament to this paradox. My parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian, were barred from marrying in the Catholic Church due to my father's denomination. The harsh judgment of the Church's rigid expectations left a bitter taste, a reminder that its teachings often fall short of its ideals. The lesson learned was clear: the pursuit of love and acceptance is often at odds with the strictures of tradition.\n\nAs I ponder the role of priests, I am drawn to the question of their marital status. Permitting them to marry might alleviate some of the suffering that has plagued the Church, but would it truly prevent the aberrant behavior of those who would harm children? I fear not, for the corruption of the heart is a burden that cannot be easily lifted. The pedophilic tendencies of some may be a manifestation of deeper, more complex issues, and marriage, or the lack thereof, is merely a symptom, not a cause.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that holds the key to redemption, but rather a fundamental shift in values, a recognition that love and acceptance know no bounds, that the dignity of every soul is paramount. The Church's adherence to tradition, while comforting to some, must not come at the expense of its most vulnerable members. As I reflect on this complex web of doctrine and practice, I am left with a sense of unease, a feeling that the Church's rigid stance on marriage and family is a mere facade, a veil that conceals the true depths of its convictions.",
            "The mire of this conundrum has left me lost in its stagnant waters. The weight of the question presses upon me like a physical force, an unseen hand that pinches at the joints of my mind. Separation of church and state, a delicate balance that teeters on the precipice of offense, a tremulous dance between the sacred and the secular. And at the heart of it all, the sacrament of marriage, a bond forged in the fire of devotion, a union of flesh and soul. Can it be reduced to a civil contract, a mere trifle of state recognition? Must the government's gaze be turned away, refusing to sully its eyes with the intimate details of love?\n\nI am torn, a leaf caught in the whirlpool of opposing currents. The idea of marriage as a civil union seems a paltry thing, a shallow imitation of the true bond that exists between two souls. And yet, can the state truly be expected to recognize the sacrament, to confer upon it a status that transcends the mundane? The impulse to separate church and state, to keep the sacred and the profane apart, is a noble one. But does it not risk reducing the human experience to a mere cipher, a series of sterile abstractions?\n\nThe notion of gay marriage stirs up a tempest within me, a maelstrom of conflicting emotions. Is it not a union of two people, a bond that should be recognized and respected, regardless of the trappings of tradition or convention? And yet, can it be said that this union is the same as that of any other couple, that the government's recognition of it would not somehow sully the very fabric of society?\n\nThe call for a federal law, a logical conclusion arrived at through the aggregation of state opinions, seems a palatable solution. But a constitutional amendment, a sweeping change to the foundation of our society, seems an overreach, a reaction born of passion rather than reason. To amend the constitution for this cause alone seems a gross overstatement, a recognition of the importance of this issue that I do not share.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, lost in the mire of this conundrum. The question of gay marriage, like the question of the separation of church and state, is a complex and multifaceted one, a Gordian knot that resists easy solution. I can offer no clear answer, only the murmur of doubts and uncertainties that haunt me like a specter.",
            "I grew up in a household where faith was a guiding force, and as such, I've grappled with the concept of homosexuality in a manner both introspective and ambivalent. My relationships with individuals who identify as gay have fostered a certain familiarity, yet I've come to realize that my own stance on the matter is complex and multifaceted. I do not entirely condone the lifestyle, but I firmly believe that it should be a decision left to the discretion of each individual state, rather than a federal mandate.\n\nI understand that our nation is comprised of diverse states, each with their own unique values and ideologies. Democratic states, for instance, tend to lean more progressive on issues such as gay marriage. Were one to reside in a state that has chosen to legalize gay marriage, I believe it would be prudent to respect their decision, for it is a choice one makes by residing within that state's borders.\n\nMy stance is not that homosexuality should be universally accepted or condemned; rather, I believe that individuals should be afforded the same opportunities and rights as their heterosexual counterparts. Therefore, the decision to legalize gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state, allowing them to govern their own affairs without undue federal interference.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the president's views on the matter should not supersede the will of individual states. The notion that President Bush's stance on gay marriage should dictate a nationwide policy seems misguided, as he represents but one aspect of our federal government. Ultimately, it is the states themselves that must live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president. Thus, I firmly believe that each state should have the autonomy to decide its own stance on gay marriage, free from federal overreach.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not support a blanket nationwide ban on gay marriage. Instead, I advocate for a system where individual states are empowered to make their own decisions, allowing for a more nuanced and diverse approach to this complex issue.",
            "The notion that posting on Myspace is a public thing is a notion that I do not at all subscribe to. I suppose it's a notion that's been drummed into our collective consciousness - that anything one posts on the internet is fair game for anyone to see. But that's not entirely true.\n\nWhen one posts something on the internet, whether it be a bulletin or a simple message, that action is not without consequence. It's akin to shouting one's innermost thoughts from the mountaintop - anything that escapes the confines of the digital realm can be seen and heard by anyone who dares to listen.\n\nAnd it's precisely this notion that I think the school officials had a right to consider when they accessed my Myspace profile. Even if I wasn't posting under the school's name, the fact remains that they could have accessed it from their homes, and that's a distinction without a difference. The fact that they were keeping a watchful eye on their students' online activities is not an invasion of privacy, but rather a necessary measure to ensure the safety of those in their care.\n\nI recall a conversation I had with a teacher of mine at my public high school, in which we discussed the necessity of monitoring students' online activities. We talked about how lock downs and drills were put in place to prepare for the unthinkable, and how those measures were a direct response to the fear of terrorist attacks and school shootings. I see the school officials' actions as an extension of that same logic - a proactive measure to prevent anything bad from happening.\n\nThe fact that I may have posted something on Myspace that I didn't intend for school officials to see is beside the point. The truth is, once something is on the internet, it's always there, waiting to be discovered. And I'd be foolish to think that my words wouldn't have consequences. It's a risk we all take when we post online, and it's one that I'm not naive enough to ignore.\n\nIn the end, I think the school officials' actions were justified. If it means keeping students safe, then I'm all for it. And that's what I've been trying to say all along - it's a public thing, and we should be aware of the consequences of our actions.",
            "The ghosts of war still linger within me, a specter born of the embers of nine eleven. It was a day that seared my soul, a day that laid bare the abyss that separates us from the chaos that festers beyond our borders. I recall the fervor that gripped me then, a zeal that blinded me to the ruin that would follow. We were a nation bent on vengeance, driven by a hunger for retribution that would only be satiated by the destruction of others. But in the aftermath, I came to see the folly of our endeavors. The flames of war had been fanned by emotions, not reason, and we marched forward with a zealot's fervor, unprepared for the devastation that would be wrought.\n\nIn the crucible of war, I witnessed the contradictions that have long defined our relationship with the world. We speak of progress, of freedom, of democracy, but our actions betray a grim reality: that we are a people bent on imposing our will upon others, rather than listening to their stories, their struggles, and their hopes. The people of Iraq, I came to realize, were not our enemies, but rather, they were us – flawed, imperfect, and torn asunder by our own making.\n\nWe delved into the heart of their world with a recklessness that bordered on savagery, our actions driven by a desire to reshape their destiny, rather than to understand their plight. And in the end, we created a void, a chasm that cannot be bridged. The war has left us with a legacy of blood and ash, a reminder that our power is not a panacea, but a poison that has seeped into the very fabric of their being.\n\nI have come to believe that we are not the saviors we pretend to be, but rather, we are the authors of our own undoing. Our presence has only served to embolden the very factions we sought to vanquish, and our departure will only hasten the collapse of a system that has been forever altered by our interference. We have sown the seeds of discord, and now we reap the whirlwind.\n\nIn the silence of the night, I am haunted by the voices of the dead, their whispers a reminder of the cost of our hubris. I am left to ponder the wisdom of our actions, to question the motives that drove us forward, and to wonder if we have been foolish to believe that we could impose our will upon the world. The ghosts of war still linger, a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that the price of our pride may be higher than we can bear."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

The Church's inflexibility on matters such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control has become a barrier to its relevance, a stumbling block that is causing it to lose its hold on the faithful.\n\nThe winds of change are whispering through the corridors of history, and the Church's refusal to adapt is leaving it vulnerable to the tempests of dissent. The issue is not that the Church's views are without merit, but rather that they are seemingly frozen in a bygone era, unyielding to the currents of progress. By clinging to these outdated tenets, the Church risks losing its flock, its members drifting away like autumn leaves on a gusty day.\n\nIn an age of growing acceptance and understanding, the Church's stance on these issues seems increasingly out of sync. The result is a chasm between the faithful and those who would follow, a chasm that threatens to swallow the Church whole. The Church's rejection of abortion, for example, may be a catechism of old, but in a world where choices and opinions are increasingly nuanced, it can no longer be the sole arbiter of truth.\n\nThe notion that priests must remain celibate, that they are wedded to God alone, seems a relic of a bygone era. In a world where professionals and families coexist, where devotion and duty are not mutually exclusive, it is puzzling that the Church cannot see the value in allowing its priests to form meaningful connections with the world. The Church's stance on female priests, too, raises questions about its commitment to equality and justice. In a world where women are increasingly empowered, why should the Church lag behind?\n\nThe Church's inability to adapt has led to a crisis of faith, a sense of disillusionment that has left many questioning its relevance. Like a great oak whose branches have been pruned back, the Church risks becoming a hollow shell of its former self, a relic of a bygone era. It is time for the Church to reassess its stance on these issues, to find a middle ground that will allow it to reconnect with the world and reclaim its place as a beacon of hope and guidance.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, as the world outside recedes into the shadows, the Church must confront the darkness within. It is a darkness that threatens to consume it, to leave it a hollow husk of its former self. But it is also a darkness that holds the seed of redemption, a chance for the Church to rediscover its mission and its purpose. Let us hope that it will seize this opportunity, that it will find a way to heal the schisms and reconnect with the world.",
            "The query of marriage. A fissure in the bedrock of our societal edifice. I find myself pondering this issue, torn asunder by the conflicting tides of reason and sentiment. As I sit in the desolate silence, the ash-strewn landscape stretching out before me like a funereal shroud, I am drawn to the notion that the manner in which one is born is not a choice, but a cold, unforgiving fact. Like the wind that howls through the barren trees, it is a force beyond our control, a primal urge that cannot be tempered by human will.\n\nIn this bleak and unforgiving world, I believe it is our duty to acknowledge and respect the intrinsic nature of those around us. To hold individuals accountable for their orientation is to impose a moral judgment, a notion that seems as futile as attempting to stem the tide of a raging river. The fluidity of existence is a mystery that defies our understanding, and to try to impose our own morality upon it is to risk being consumed by its turbulent depths.\n\nThe federal government, with its heavy hand and broad brush, seems an ill-equipped arbiter of this issue. Their involvement is a clumsy intrusion, a clumsy attempt to impose order on a chaos that resists our comprehension. It is a question of personal liberty, not national security or moral rectitude, and thus falls outside the purview of their authority.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of basic humanity. To deny individuals their right to love and be loved, to be who they are without fear of reprisal or condemnation, is to deny the very essence of our shared experience. And so, like the wind that blows through the desolate landscape, I am drawn to the notion that this is a matter of simple decency, a fundamental aspect of our shared humanity that cannot be legislated or regulated away.",
            "In this desolate expanse of our world, where the crumbling edifices of morality stand as hollow testaments to the transience of values, the question of gay marriage lingers, a festering wound that refuses to heal. It is a debate that has been reduced to a cacophony of sound bites, a jumbled mess of half-truths and misconceptions, where the voices of reason are drowned out by the din of ignorance.\n\nBut amidst this chaos, a glimmer of sense can be found. It is a simple truth, one that has been lost in the mire of fear and prejudice: that love knows no bounds, neither those of sex nor those of creed. It is a force that transcends the petty squabbles of humanity, a flame that burns bright and true, unencumbered by the shackles of societal expectation.\n\nThe arguments against gay marriage are legion, a litany of half-baked excuses and crackpot theories, each one a feeble attempt to justify the unjustifiable. The notion that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family is nothing but a red herring, a canard perpetuated by those who would seek to maintain their grip on power. It is a tired, threadbare argument, one that has been disproven time and time again by the simple fact of existence.\n\nAnd yet, it persists. Like a festering wound, it refuses to heal, a constant reminder of the dark underbelly of human nature. But it is a wound that can be healed, one that can be cauterized by the simple act of compassion and understanding.\n\nThe scientific studies are clear: gay couples are just as capable of sustained, fulfilling relationships as their heterosexual counterparts. They share the same hopes, the same dreams, the same fears. They are not somehow inherently different, nor are they somehow lesser. They are human beings, just as we are, with all the frailties and vulnerabilities that come with it.\n\nAnd yet, the debate rages on, fueled by the passions of the ignorant and the bigoted. It is a debate that has nothing to do with the rights of individuals, but rather with the power of the state to dictate what is and is not acceptable. It is a debate that has been hijacked by the zealots, who would seek to impose their will on the rest of us.\n\nBut it is a futile effort, one that will ultimately be doomed to failure. For the truth will out, no matter how hard we try to bury it. The fact is that gay marriage is not about the rights of the individual, but about the fundamental human right to love and be loved in return. It is about the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of their creed, their color, or their orientation.\n\nAnd so, as we stumble through this dark world, as we navigate the minefield of morality and ethics, we must remember this simple truth: that love is the one constant that binds us all together. It is the one thing that can transcend the petty squabbles of humanity, that can bring us together in a shared humanity.\n\nIn the end, it is not about the politics of it all, nor is it about the religious fervor that drives so many to oppose it. It is about the simple, human need to love and be loved. It is about the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of who they are or who they love.\n\nIn this desolate expanse of our world, where the crumbling edifices of morality stand as hollow testaments to the transience of values, this is the one thing that remains constant: the human heart, beating with a love that knows no bounds.",
            "The pharmacy I work at during the summer months is a place where the boundaries between life and death are blurred. It's a place where the very fabric of existence is stretched thin, where the threads of hope and despair are intertwined. I've seen it time and time again - the desperation in the eyes of those who come seeking solace in the pills and potions we dispense. But it's a double-edged sword, one that cuts both ways. For every life it saves, it takes another. The line between benefit and harm is a thin one, and it's a line that's often crossed.\n\nThe illegal nature of a drug, I've come to realize, is no guarantee of its inherent value. There are many substances, like oxycodone and Vicodin, that are forbidden yet still find their way into our pharmacy. We use them because they possess certain... let's call them \"properties\" that make them beneficial to our patients. But what of marijuana, that most vilified of substances? Is it not worthy of the same consideration?\n\nThe parallels between marijuana and alcohol are often drawn, but they're a false one. Both can be abused, yes, but the latter is a poison that ravages the soul as much as the body. Marijuana, on the other hand, is a substance that can be harnessed, its benefits realized with restraint. The key, I firmly believe, lies in education and understanding. If we can peel away the stigma, the taboo that surrounds it, perhaps we can unlock its true potential.\n\nBut how do we do this? By embracing it wholeheartedly, without reservation? I think not. No, the path forward lies in gradual integration, a measured approach that balances the desire for freedom with the need for responsibility. Remove the shackles of prohibition, and we risk unleashing a torrent of abuse. But by allowing it, in measured doses, we may yet find a way to harness its benefits.\n\nThe images that surround marijuana are distorted, a caricature of the truth. It's not the devil's weed, as some would have you believe, but a plant with its own unique properties and potential. And it's precisely this potential that we should be exploring, not demonizing. For in the end, it's not the substance itself that's the problem, but our own perceptions of it.",
            "The church, a monument to the shifting tides of time, has surrendered to the whims of the twenty-first century. Its once-imposing façade now yields to the casualities of modernity. Gone are the days of strict adherence to tradition; the hushed tones of reverence give way to the murmur of the mundane. I recall Sundays spent in the pews of my youth, the ritual of dressing in my best attire a testament to the gravity of the occasion. My mother would fuss over my outfit, ensuring that I was presented to the world with the dignity befitting a child of the Lord. The private school I attended added to the sense of formality, where on weekends I would reunite with friends clad in our finest Sunday finery.\n\nBut times change, and the church has adapted, its services shrinking to a mere thirty minutes, a concession to the fleeting nature of attention spans. The summer months bring an influx of beachwear, a far cry from the starched collars and high-button shoes of yesteryear. Even the morning masses, once a bastion of tradition, have given way to the informality of jeans and khakis. It is a sea change, one that I neither condone nor lament, merely acknowledge.\n\nAs for the issue of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I believe it is a canker that cannot be excised by a simple change in policy. The institution has been beset by scandal, and it is a tragedy that these atrocities could have been perpetrated under the very roof of the Lord. Some might suggest that allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry could have mitigated these instances, but I fear it is a chimera. Pedophilia is a fundamental aspect of human nature, a flaw that cannot be rectified by the mere trappings of societal norms.\n\nI recall a television show, Seventh Heaven, where a reverend was depicted as a married man of the cloth. It seemed a quaint notion, a far cry from the strictures of the Catholic Church. But even in that context, the reverend's marital status did not preclude him from his duties as a spiritual leader. It is a distinction without a difference; the underlying impulse remains the same.\n\nI believe that pedophilia is an inescapable aspect of human biology, a product of genetics rather than environment. It is a notion that cannot be altered by the trappings of social convention. The church, in all its forms, must confront this reality head-on, acknowledging the darkness that lurks within its midst. To pretend otherwise is to court disaster.\n\nAs I ponder the Catholic Church, I am left with a sense of sorrow and disillusionment. The institution has failed in its duty to protect the most vulnerable, and for that, it will forever bear the stain of shame. But I do not believe that it is a matter of policy or procedure; it is a fundamental failing of humanity itself.",
            "The embers of a once burning fire had long since dwindled to cold ash, and the embers of truth were no less extinguished. The precipice from which we leapt into the chasm of Iraq was shrouded in a mist of deceit, its precipitating factor the aftermath of September 11th. The administration's glib supposition, that the war was a direct response to the attacks, had been a mere pretext, a paltry attempt to obscure the true intent.\n\nA certain duplicity had become a defining characteristic of the Bush administration, their penchant for deception having left a trail of ruin in its wake. The specter of malfeasance hung heavy, as the very fabric of our democracy was strained to its breaking point. Even the stalwart Colin Powell, now an apostate from the fold, had publicly confessed to harboring doubts regarding the veracity of the evidence presented at the UN.\n\nThe Constitution, that sacred document upon which our nation was founded, was wilfully disregarded, its principles and protections callously cast aside. The administration's actions were a betrayal of the very oath they had sworn to uphold, an affront to the concept of truth and accountability. It was a brazen attempt to supplant the rule of law with the rule of whim, a reckless disregard for the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe instrumentalities of power, wielded by an administration hell-bent on self-aggrandizement, had been used to further their own interests, rather than the interests of the nation they claimed to serve. The specter of a 'blood vengeance' against Saddam Hussein loomed large, a vendetta born of the past, and a hunger for power that would stop at nothing.\n\nThe war, a catastrophic and misguided endeavor, had dragged on for far too long, its costs in blood and treasure incalculable. The prospect of withdrawal was fraught with peril, the very real possibility of civil war and further bloodshed hanging in the balance. The nascent government, a fragile and ephemeral thing, teetered on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty hanging precariously in the balance.\n\nA coalition of surrounding nations, a Faustian bargain, was touted as the solution, a panacea for the ills that had been wrought. But this would only serve to sow the seeds of future discord, as the very notion of Iraqi sovereignty was cast aside, and the nation was plunged into further chaos.\n\nIn the midst of this maelstrom, the once-promising interim government was reduced to a mere shell of its former self, a hollow husk devoid of authority or direction. The Parliament, a shadow of its former self, was riven by factional squabbles, its effectiveness nonexistent. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, wielded little real power, as the radical elements, still vying for control, continued to sow discord and instability.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves lost in a wilderness of confusion, our national discourse reduced to a cacophony of sound and fury, signifying nothing. The truth, that most elusive of commodities, had been lost in the maelstrom, leaving us to pick up the pieces of a shattered nation, and to wonder if redemption was even possible.",
            "In the hollow of his chest, a faint murmur stirred. He strained to think of the war in Iraq, to grasp the threads of his thoughts and weave them into a coherent tapestry. The silence was oppressive, a weight that pressed upon his mind like the ashes that shrouded the land. He sought to speak, to articulate the turmoil that churned within him, but the words refused to come.\n\nHe began, haltingly, his voice a tentative whisper. It feels pointless, he said, this war that raged across the desert sands. No declaration, no formal call to arms, just a maelstrom of blood and fire that consumed all in its path. And for what? To impose our will upon a people, to force upon them a democracy that would be nothing more than a pale imitation of our own? The thought was galling, a bitter taste that soured his mouth.\n\nBut then, too, he thought of the families, the sons and daughters who had been torn from their homes, sent to fight in a war that seemed without purpose. And the people of Iraq, their lives shattered, their cities reduced to rubble. He felt a pang of guilt, a sense of responsibility for the destruction that had been wrought.\n\nAnd yet, he couldn't shake the feeling that we were meddling, imposing our values upon a culture that was not our own. The Al-Kaida threat loomed, a specter that seemed to grow more menacing with each passing day. The more we stayed, the more we risked being drawn into a quagmire, a never-ending cycle of violence and hate.\n\nHe trailed off, his thoughts consumed by the silence. The ash swirled around him, a reminders of the desolation that had been wrought. He felt lost, adrift in a world that seemed to be spinning out of control.\n\nIn the end, he couldn't say what he thought, couldn't find the words to articulate the turmoil that churned within him. He simply sat, lost in the darkness, the ash falling around him like a shroud. [END]",
            "The notion of government intervention in matters of faith strains against the worn fabric of our nation's founding principles. The constitution's clause of separation of church and state stands as a bulwark against the entanglement of the two, safeguarding the freedom of conscience that has come to define us. It's a notion, stark and clear, that the government should not usurp the authority of the churches, but rather allow them to chart their own course.\n\nTo attempt to codify a ban on certain practices, to wield the power of the state against the churches, would be an affront to the very foundation of our democracy. It would be a declaration that one faith's conviction trumps the convictions of another, a notion abhorrent to the tolerant spirit that has long defined our nation.\n\nThe constitution, that revered and oft-repeated text, is a clarion call to the virtues of freedom and the free exercise of conscience. To amend it now, to impose a restriction on the people, would be a perversion of its intent. It would be an amendment born of expediency, not principle, and would serve only to restrict the very people it purports to protect.\n\nThe government's role is not to dictate the terms of faith, but to safeguard the rights of all its citizens to worship as they see fit. The president's push for such an amendment reeks of a bias, a preference for one faith over another. It is a move born of personal conviction, not a desire to serve the greater good.\n\nThe economy, the society, the very fabric of our nation would be better served by leaving the churches to their own devices. For it is in the free exercise of faith, unimpeded by the heavy hand of government, that we find true strength and resilience. The notion that such an amendment would somehow boost the economy or improve society is a tenuous at best, and one that does little to justify the infringement on the rights of the people.\n\nIn the end, it is the churches that must be left to decide their own course, unfettered by the dictates of the state. Anything less would be an affront to the very principles that have come to define us as a nation.",
            "In the desolate landscape of our time, the war in Iraq lies like a festering wound, a scar that refuses to heal. The memories of September 11th, 2001, still linger in the air, a palpable fog that shrouds the truth. The government, a behemoth with a penchant for deception, sought to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks, exploiting the collective grief of the American people. But the connection was tenuous at best, a flimsy thread that snapped beneath the weight of reality.\n\nAs the years went by, the war in Iraq unfolded like a macabre dance, a repetition of the same mistakes made in Vietnam. The government, once again, failed to learn from its past blunders, blind to the consequences of its actions. The soldiers, the brave men and women who fought and died, were mere pawns in a game of power and politics.\n\nTheir deaths, countless and senseless, a grim reminder of the government's hubris. The removal of the Iraqi government, a catastrophic event that left a power vacuum, a chasm that the US was ill-prepared to fill. The aftermath, a maelstrom of chaos and violence, a testament to the government's shortsightedness.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a war that should never have been, a war that was fought on false pretenses. The search for weapons of mass destruction, a mirage that vanished upon closer inspection. The real reason, the true motivation, the lust for oil, a hidden truth that only the most perceptive can see.\n\nAs the years drag on, the casualties mount, the American people are left to wonder: is it worth it? The cost, the human toll, the shattered lives, the families torn apart. The war, a quagmire that seems to have no end, a never-ending cycle of blood and steel.\n\nWe, the people, are left to pick up the pieces, to try to make sense of the madness that has been unleashed. We are naive to believe that democracy can be imposed, that it can be forced upon a people who have not asked for it. We are naive to think that the government will always act with truth and integrity.\n\nIn the end, it is not the war that is the problem, but the lies that led to it, the deceit that shrouds our government, the corruption that permeates our institutions. The war in Iraq is a symptom of a larger disease, a disease that infects us all, a disease of greed, of power, of control.\n\nLet us hope that one day, we will learn from our mistakes, that we will find the courage to confront the truth, to face the darkness that lies within ourselves. Let us hope that the war in Iraq will be a lesson, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power, of the importance of truth and integrity. But until then, we are left to suffer the consequences of our actions, to wander in the desolate landscape of our own making.",
            "The thing is, I don't believe in the constraints of others. I've always thought that love is love, regardless of the specifics. It's personal, a string that binds two souls together. And what's the nature of that string, anyway? Is it something we're born with, a thread of DNA that weaves through our very being? Or is it something we cultivate, a garden of emotions that grow and flourish with time? I think it's a mix of both, a dance of fate and choice.\n\nI've seen it in my own life, the way people live, the way they love. My neighbors, good people, two men living together, just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they tend their garden, they love each other just as any other couple would. And what business is it of mine, or anyone else's, to say otherwise? The President, with his interpretations and his moralities, trying to tell us what marriage means. It's a farce, a charade, a mockery of the very concept.\n\nI've read the studies, the research, the statistics. It's not just a matter of choice, not just a matter of upbringing. There's something biological at play, a chemical whisper in the brain that guides us. And what's wrong with that? Is it not the same as a preference for the color blue or the taste of strawberries? Why should we deny people their fundamental right to love, just because it doesn't fit our narrow definitions?\n\nAnd what of the rest of us, the ones who are comfortable in our own skin, who don't need the validation of society to define our relationships? Shouldn't we be free to live our lives as we see fit, without the weight of others' judgment? Marriage, in the end, is a personal thing, a private contract between two people. It's not for the government to dictate, not for the media to sensationalize. It's a matter of love, of commitment, of two people choosing to spend their lives together.\n\nSo, I say, let us not concern ourselves with the specifics. Let us not try to define what love looks like, what it feels like. Let us simply allow people to be, to love as they choose, without fear of reprisal or rejection. It's a basic human right, after all, and one that we should be proud to defend.",
            "In the vast and unyielding expanse of the digital realm, a singular truth holds sway: once set loose, the words of a man can become the wind that rustles the leaves of countless minds. This is a reality that I have come to know all too well in my role as a resident advisor, where the delicate balance between freedom and responsibility is ever-shifting. When words are breathed into the ether of the internet, they assume a life of their own, unbound by the constraints of time and space. In this boundless expanse, the distinction between jest and earnest intent becomes increasingly tenuous, and the lines between public and private blur like the edges of a forgotten photograph.\n\nAs I've witnessed firsthand, the careless utterance can spark a maelstrom of consequences, as the whispers of a single individual can fan the flames of anxiety and concern among those who would listen. The notion that one's words might be overheard, misinterpreted, or misconstrued by a stranger is a specter that haunts us all, a constant reminder that our thoughts and sentiments are never truly our own once they've been set free.\n\nThe ease with which information can be disseminated, shared, and scrutinized has created a world where one's digital footprint can be traversed at will, stripped bare of its context and reduced to a series of isolated words, each one a potential detonator waiting to ignite the powder keg of public opinion. And in this precarious landscape, the notion of privacy becomes a mirage, a fleeting dream that vanishes upon closer inspection.\n\nIn this regard, the actions of school officials who monitor the digital lives of their students can be seen as both a necessary evil and a brazen invasion of personal space. While it is true that the creation of social media accounts under a pseudonym or the friending of students on Myspace or Facebook can be seen as a delicate balancing act, it is also a reality that the world will not be bound by the confines of a school's walls. When concerns are brought to light, they must be addressed, lest the consequences of inaction prove catastrophic.\n\nIn the end, it is not the act of monitoring itself that is the issue, but rather the manner in which it is executed. The lines between guidance and surveillance are often blurred, leaving one to wonder: where does concern end and intrusion begin? As a resident advisor, I have come to realize that the answer lies not in the act of monitoring itself, but in the context in which it is applied. The delicate dance between freedom and responsibility is a tightrope that must be walked with care, lest the consequences of a misstep prove disastrous.",
            "The war, a drawn-out odyssey besmirched by time. Its purpose, once a beacon of hope, now lost to the murk of ambiguity. We were to be the liberators, the bringers of democracy to a people shackled by tyranny. But the days have turned to years, and the years to an endless expanse of desolation. Our actions, no longer driven by the pure intention of freedom, have been sullied by the stain of self-interest.\n\nWe speak of restoring democracy, but what of the motives that led us down this treacherous path? Were they not tainted by the complexities of power and the personal vendettas of the past? George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, their animosity a festering wound that refused to heal. And so we found ourselves entangled in a quagmire, our purpose diluted by the weight of our own ambitions.\n\nIn the beginning, we made a statement, a declaration of our intent to bring light to a world shrouded in darkness. But time has worn away at our resolve, and we are now mired in the quicksand of indecision. We yearn for a decisive victory, a triumphant end to this conflict, but the truth is, our purpose has been lost to the sands of time.\n\nWe spend billions upon billions, draining our own economy, as our own people suffer. We pour our treasure into a war that has long since lost its justification. The people of the country we sought to liberate are left to fend for themselves, while we squander our resources on a conflict that has become a hollow shell of its former self.\n\nWar is not a luxury we can afford, not in a world where poverty and neglect cry out for attention. We have our own wounds to heal, our own battles to fight. The money we spend on this war could be better spent on schools, on roads, on healthcare, on the very fabric of our own society. And so we are left to ponder the cost of our actions, to wonder if the ends justify the means, and to pray that one day we will find our way back to the purpose that once drove us.\n\nWe are not the liberators we once claimed to be, but rather the perpetrators of a conflict that has lost its way. Our actions, no longer guided by the pure intention of freedom, have become a mere exercise in futility, a testament to the destructive power of human ambition.

A specter born of the whispers and warnings that echo through the digital halls, a cautionary tale of the perils that lurk in the shadows of the online world.\n\nIn the virtual realm, we surrender a portion of our lives to the void, allowing the gaze of others to fall upon us like a cold, unforgiving wind. We post and share, we reveal and conceal, all under the guise of convenience and connection. But in doing so, we also invite the unwanted gaze of strangers, their eyes upon us like a chill in the darkness.\n\nConsider the example of Myspace, a platform where one's profile can be accessed by anyone who knows the password, a password shared with friends and acquaintances, a password that grants permission to those who would seek to intrude upon our private lives. And yet, even with such safeguards in place, the boundaries between public and private begin to blur, the lines between consent and invasion growing increasingly indistinct.\n\nIt's a difficult balance to strike, one that weighs the need for connection against the fear of exposure. We yearn for the intimacy of the online world, the ease of communication and the sense of community it provides. And yet, we also fear the prying eyes that lurk in the shadows, the strangers who would seek to exploit our vulnerabilities and manipulate our trust.\n\nThe question remains, is it an invasion of privacy to monitor an individual's online activity, to scour their profile for signs of danger or deceit? Or is it a necessary measure, a means of protecting the vulnerable from those who would seek to harm them? The answer, much like the digital landscape itself, is shrouded in uncertainty, a labyrinth of gray areas and conflicting perspectives.\n\nAs one who has traversed this digital expanse, I can attest to the treacherous nature of online interactions. The ease with which strangers can access our personal information, the ways in which they can manipulate and deceive. It's a world where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are constantly shifting, where the lines between consent and coercion are repeatedly blurred.\n\nAnd yet, even with these risks in mind, I still find myself drawn to the online world, a world that offers a sense of connection and community that is hard to find elsewhere. It's a double-edged sword, one that cuts both ways, offering the promise of intimacy and the threat of invasion.\n\nIn the end, it's a delicate balance, one that requires a constant negotiation between the need for connection and the fear of exposure. A balance that is as fragile as the digital threads that bind us together, as ephemeral as the whispers that echo through the online halls.",
            "In the bleak expanse of a forgotten landscape, the echoes of war linger. The Iraq War, a calamity of grand proportions, casts a long shadow over the world. It was a disaster from its inception, a calamity born of hubris and blind ambition. The consensus was clear: the invasion was a bad idea, a folly that would only lead to more suffering and chaos.\n\nPolls from across the globe bear witness to this fact. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population views the war as a catastrophic mistake. The Iraqi people, the very ones we sought to liberate, now overwhelmingly demand our departure. Even the soldiers who fought in the conflict, a staggering seventy percent, believe the war was a grave error, and that we should extricate ourselves within the year.\n\nYet, like the ghostly apparitions that haunt the ruins of a forgotten city, the war's remnants cling to life. A culture clash of epic proportions has taken hold, a chasm so vast that it defies comprehension. The United States, with its vaunted ideals of democracy, has attempted to impose its will upon a people who would rather chart their own course. The result has been a quagmire, a quagmire of endless suffering and bloodshed.\n\nThe administration's justification for remaining in Iraq is a tangle of half-truths and unconvincing arguments. They speak of stability and security, but these are mere shibboleths, empty words that ring hollow in the face of reality. The people of Iraq have spoken, and their voices are clear: leave us be.\n\nIf we continue to occupy their land, we risk perpetuating the very cycle of violence and chaos we sought to eradicate. The statistics are stark: eighty percent of Iraqis demand our departure within the year, and a quarter of them urge us to leave immediately. These are the people we claim to be liberating, the people we claim to be saving. Do we not listen to their pleas?\n\nPerhaps it is time to acknowledge that our presence in Iraq has been a disaster, a calamity that will only continue to unfold if we remain. We have been told that we are the good guys, that we are the bringers of democracy and freedom. But the truth is more nuanced, more complicated. We are a power, a force that has imposed its will upon a people who would rather live under their own terms.\n\nThe time has come to extricate ourselves from this quagmire. We must listen to the voices of the Iraqi people, to the soldiers who have fought and bled for a cause that has lost all sense. We must acknowledge the reality of our failure, and begin the long and arduous process of withdrawal.\n\nFor in the end, it is not our presence that has brought stability to Iraq, but rather our absence. It is our departure that will allow the Iraqi people to chart their own course, to forge their own destiny. Only then can we hope to redeem ourselves, to find a glimmer of redemption in the ashes of our failure.",
            "In a land ravaged by the fetid breath of prejudice, where the stench of inequality clings to every surface, the specter of gender bias haunts the streets of America. It is a cancer, festering in the marrow of society, its tendrils snaking into every crevice of the workaday world. The glass ceiling, that supposedly transparent barrier, still bars the way for women, who toil in the shadows, their talents and abilities obscured by the weight of a millennia-old narrative.\n\nIn the rarefied realm of corporate power, the boardroom elite often prove unwilling to promote women to positions of authority, their decisions guided by a historically entrenched bias that views the feminine as inferior. And yet, this is not a one-way street; men too, in certain industries, are subject to the whims of societal expectation. In the rarefied world of fashion, for instance, a man's interest in the field is often met with skepticism, as if his very masculinity is somehow suspect. His involvement is seen as a novelty, a fleeting aberration from the norm.\n\nIn the domestic sphere, the traditional division of labor often renders stay-at-home fathers vulnerable to ridicule and scorn. The societal expectation that men must be breadwinners, providers, is a heavy burden to bear, and one that can weigh heavily on the male half of the equation. Why, the critics ask, would a man choose to abandon his masculine duties and devote himself to childcare? The answer, of course, is that he may simply wish to be present, to nurture and guide his children as they grow and develop. But this is a notion that society has yet to fully grasp.\n\nAs we navigate the labyrinthine corridors of progress, it becomes clear that change is a slow and arduous process. The needle of equality has moved, incrementally, over the years, but there is still much work to be done. Women have made strides in the corporate world, taking on leadership roles and shattering glass ceilings. But the journey is far from over. Men, too, are beginning to re-evaluate their roles, questioning the traditional expectations placed upon them.\n\nIn this delicate dance of social evolution, it is crucial that we tread carefully, lest we risk alienating those we seek to persuade. To boldly push for change can be counterproductive, often triggering resistance in those who feel threatened by the status quo. Instead, we must strive to highlight the qualities that make individuals exceptional, regardless of their background or biology. By celebrating the unique strengths and talents of those who defy societal norms, we can create a more inclusive, more compassionate world.\n\nIn this fragile balance, we find ourselves at a crossroads. The road ahead is long, winding, and fraught with obstacles. But it is a journey we must undertake, for the sake of our collective humanity. By acknowledging the many faces of discrimination, we can begin to chip away at the edifice of prejudice, one small step at a time. And though the progress may be slow, it is a journey worth taking, for in the end, it is only by embracing our differences that we may truly find common ground.",
            "The laws changed, a shift in the current. Decriminalization, they called it. The weight of the law, no longer crushing. The man's hands, freed from the chains of oppression, now grasped the reins of reason. It was no longer a felony, but a mere infraction, a speed ticket to be dealt with and forgotten. The people worried about the consequences, the stains on their records, the whispers of disapproval. But the cost of arrest, of prosecution, of incarceration, a heavy burden, one that could be lifted. The municipalities, struggling to stay afloat, saw the sense in it. The city of Denver, a bastion of progress, a place where the wind of change blew strong, where the people were open-minded, where the chains of tradition were shed. And so they moved forward, leaving behind the shackles of the past.\n\nBut the debate raged on, a tempest in a teapot. Some said it was a slippery slope, a Pandora's box that would unleash a torrent of chaos upon the land. The streets would be choked with the stench of smoke, the air thick with the haze of euphoria. The motor skills of the drivers would falter, the roads a battleground of accidents and mayhem. And the society, already fragile, would crumble under the weight of this new freedom.\n\nBut others saw it differently, a glass half full, a cup overflowing with possibilities. The money, once spent on the war on drugs, could be poured into the streams of education, of social programs, of food for the hungry. The people, once imprisoned, could be free, their minds unshackled, their creativity unbridled. And the city, once a wasteland of despair, could bloom, a garden of hope and opportunity.\n\nI myself am torn, a ship tossed on the waves of doubt. I see the arguments on both sides, the pros and cons, the for and against. But as I stand on the shore, looking out at the sea of uncertainty, I am drawn to the tide of progress. The future, like the horizon, stretches out before us, a vast expanse of possibility. And I believe that we must move forward, into the unknown, with hope in our hearts and the wind at our backs.",
            "In the hush of reflection, I find myself standing at the precipice of tradition. The echoes of the past reverberate, reminding me that many of the actions we undertake are rooted in a bygone era. Like the worn grooves of a well-traveled path, these customs have been etched into our collective psyche, their familiarity a comforting certainty. Yet, it is equally essential to acknowledge the necessity of adaptability, to bend with the winds of change like a withered branch yielding to the tempest.\n\nIn the Catholic faith, tradition is a sacred trust, a set of dogma handed down through the ages. The expectation is clear: attend Mass each Sunday, adhere to the doctrine, and be judged by the strictest of standards. But beneath the surface, a discordant note resonates – a dissonance born of contradiction. For while the Church preaches love and acceptance, its practices often falter, excluding those who do not conform, those whose devotion is deemed imperfect.\n\nMy own family's story is a testament to this paradox. My parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian, were barred from marrying in the Catholic Church due to my father's denomination. The harsh judgment of the Church's rigid expectations left a bitter taste, a reminder that its teachings often fall short of its ideals. The lesson learned was clear: the pursuit of love and acceptance is often at odds with the strictures of tradition.\n\nAs I ponder the role of priests, I am drawn to the question of their marital status. Permitting them to marry might alleviate some of the suffering that has plagued the Church, but would it truly prevent the aberrant behavior of those who would harm children? I fear not, for the corruption of the heart is a burden that cannot be easily lifted. The pedophilic tendencies of some may be a manifestation of deeper, more complex issues, and marriage, or the lack thereof, is merely a symptom, not a cause.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that holds the key to redemption, but rather a fundamental shift in values, a recognition that love and acceptance know no bounds, that the dignity of every soul is paramount. The Church's adherence to tradition, while comforting to some, must not come at the expense of its most vulnerable members. As I reflect on this complex web of doctrine and practice, I am left with a sense of unease, a feeling that the Church's rigid stance on marriage and family is a mere facade, a veil that conceals the true depths of its convictions.",
            "The mire of this conundrum has left me lost in its stagnant waters. The weight of the question presses upon me like a physical force, an unseen hand that pinches at the joints of my mind. Separation of church and state, a delicate balance that teeters on the precipice of offense, a tremulous dance between the sacred and the secular. And at the heart of it all, the sacrament of marriage, a bond forged in the fire of devotion, a union of flesh and soul. Can it be reduced to a civil contract, a mere trifle of state recognition? Must the government's gaze be turned away, refusing to sully its eyes with the intimate details of love?\n\nI am torn, a leaf caught in the whirlpool of opposing currents. The idea of marriage as a civil union seems a paltry thing, a shallow imitation of the true bond that exists between two souls. And yet, can the state truly be expected to recognize the sacrament, to confer upon it a status that transcends the mundane? The impulse to separate church and state, to keep the sacred and the profane apart, is a noble one. But does it not risk reducing the human experience to a mere cipher, a series of sterile abstractions?\n\nThe notion of gay marriage stirs up a tempest within me, a maelstrom of conflicting emotions. Is it not a union of two people, a bond that should be recognized and respected, regardless of the trappings of tradition or convention? And yet, can it be said that this union is the same as that of any other couple, that the government's recognition of it would not somehow sully the very fabric of society?\n\nThe call for a federal law, a logical conclusion arrived at through the aggregation of state opinions, seems a palatable solution. But a constitutional amendment, a sweeping change to the foundation of our society, seems an overreach, a reaction born of passion rather than reason. To amend the constitution for this cause alone seems a gross overstatement, a recognition of the importance of this issue that I do not share.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, lost in the mire of this conundrum. The question of gay marriage, like the question of the separation of church and state, is a complex and multifaceted one, a Gordian knot that resists easy solution. I can offer no clear answer, only the murmur of doubts and uncertainties that haunt me like a specter.",
            "I grew up in a household where faith was a guiding force, and as such, I've grappled with the concept of homosexuality in a manner both introspective and ambivalent. My relationships with individuals who identify as gay have fostered a certain familiarity, yet I've come to realize that my own stance on the matter is complex and multifaceted. I do not entirely condone the lifestyle, but I firmly believe that it should be a decision left to the discretion of each individual state, rather than a federal mandate.\n\nI understand that our nation is comprised of diverse states, each with their own unique values and ideologies. Democratic states, for instance, tend to lean more progressive on issues such as gay marriage. Were one to reside in a state that has chosen to legalize gay marriage, I believe it would be prudent to respect their decision, for it is a choice one makes by residing within that state's borders.\n\nMy stance is not that homosexuality should be universally accepted or condemned; rather, I believe that individuals should be afforded the same opportunities and rights as their heterosexual counterparts. Therefore, the decision to legalize gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state, allowing them to govern their own affairs without undue federal interference.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the president's views on the matter should not supersede the will of individual states. The notion that President Bush's stance on gay marriage should dictate a nationwide policy seems misguided, as he represents but one aspect of our federal government. Ultimately, it is the states themselves that must live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president. Thus, I firmly believe that each state should have the autonomy to decide its own stance on gay marriage, free from federal overreach.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not support a blanket nationwide ban on gay marriage. Instead, I advocate for a system where individual states are empowered to make their own decisions, allowing for a more nuanced and diverse approach to this complex issue.",
            "The notion that posting on Myspace is a public thing is a notion that I do not at all subscribe to. I suppose it's a notion that's been drummed into our collective consciousness - that anything one posts on the internet is fair game for anyone to see. But that's not entirely true.\n\nWhen one posts something on the internet, whether it be a bulletin or a simple message, that action is not without consequence. It's akin to shouting one's innermost thoughts from the mountaintop - anything that escapes the confines of the digital realm can be seen and heard by anyone who dares to listen.\n\nAnd it's precisely this notion that I think the school officials had a right to consider when they accessed my Myspace profile. Even if I wasn't posting under the school's name, the fact remains that they could have accessed it from their homes, and that's a distinction without a difference. The fact that they were keeping a watchful eye on their students' online activities is not an invasion of privacy, but rather a necessary measure to ensure the safety of those in their care.\n\nI recall a conversation I had with a teacher of mine at my public high school, in which we discussed the necessity of monitoring students' online activities. We talked about how lock downs and drills were put in place to prepare for the unthinkable, and how those measures were a direct response to the fear of terrorist attacks and school shootings. I see the school officials' actions as an extension of that same logic - a proactive measure to prevent anything bad from happening.\n\nThe fact that I may have posted something on Myspace that I didn't intend for school officials to see is beside the point. The truth is, once something is on the internet, it's always there, waiting to be discovered. And I'd be foolish to think that my words wouldn't have consequences. It's a risk we all take when we post online, and it's one that I'm not naive enough to ignore.\n\nIn the end, I think the school officials' actions were justified. If it means keeping students safe, then I'm all for it. And that's what I've been trying to say all along - it's a public thing, and we should be aware of the consequences of our actions.",
            "The ghosts of war still linger within me, a specter born of the embers of nine eleven. It was a day that seared my soul, a day that laid bare the abyss that separates us from the chaos that festers beyond our borders. I recall the fervor that gripped me then, a zeal that blinded me to the ruin that would follow. We were a nation bent on vengeance, driven by a hunger for retribution that would only be satiated by the destruction of others. But in the aftermath, I came to see the folly of our endeavors. The flames of war had been fanned by emotions, not reason, and we marched forward with a zealot's fervor, unprepared for the devastation that would be wrought.\n\nIn the crucible of war, I witnessed the contradictions that have long defined our relationship with the world. We speak of progress, of freedom, of democracy, but our actions betray a grim reality: that we are a people bent on imposing our will upon others, rather than listening to their stories, their struggles, and their hopes. The people of Iraq, I came to realize, were not our enemies, but rather, they were us – flawed, imperfect, and torn asunder by our own making.\n\nWe delved into the heart of their world with a recklessness that bordered on savagery, our actions driven by a desire to reshape their destiny, rather than to understand their plight. And in the end, we created a void, a chasm that cannot be bridged. The war has left us with a legacy of blood and ash, a reminder that our power is not a panacea, but a poison that has seeped into the very fabric of their being.\n\nI have come to believe that we are not the saviors we pretend to be, but rather, we are the authors of our own undoing. Our presence has only served to embolden the very factions we sought to vanquish, and our departure will only hasten the collapse of a system that has been forever altered by our interference. We have sown the seeds of discord, and now we reap the whirlwind.\n\nIn the silence of the night, I am haunted by the voices of the dead, their whispers a reminder of the cost of our hubris. I am left to ponder the wisdom of our actions, to question the motives that drove us forward, and to wonder if we have been foolish to believe that we could impose our will upon the world. The ghosts of war still linger, a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that the price of our pride may be higher than we can bear."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the stagnant air of dogma, the Catholic Church's rigidity seems to be calcifying its very foundation. Like a once-noble edifice worn down by the relentless passage of time, its views, once held aloft like a beacon, now appear antiquated and out of step with the world. The Church's inflexibility on matters such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control has become a barrier to its relevance, a stumbling block that is causing it to lose its hold on the faithful.\n\nThe winds of change are whispering through the corridors of history, and the Church's refusal to adapt is leaving it vulnerable to the tempests of dissent. The issue is not that the Church's views are without merit, but rather that they are seemingly frozen in a bygone era, unyielding to the currents of progress. By clinging to these outdated tenets, the Church risks losing its flock, its members drifting away like autumn leaves on a gusty day.\n\nIn an age of growing acceptance and understanding, the Church's stance on these issues seems increasingly out of sync. The result is a chasm between the faithful and those who would follow, a chasm that threatens to swallow the Church whole. The Church's rejection of abortion, for example, may be a catechism of old, but in a world where choices and opinions are increasingly nuanced, it can no longer be the sole arbiter of truth.\n\nThe notion that priests must remain celibate, that they are wedded to God alone, seems a relic of a bygone era. In a world where professionals and families coexist, where devotion and duty are not mutually exclusive, it is puzzling that the Church cannot see the value in allowing its priests to form meaningful connections with the world. The Church's stance on female priests, too, raises questions about its commitment to equality and justice. In a world where women are increasingly empowered, why should the Church lag behind?\n\nThe Church's inability to adapt has led to a crisis of faith, a sense of disillusionment that has left many questioning its relevance. Like a great oak whose branches have been pruned back, the Church risks becoming a hollow shell of its former self, a relic of a bygone era. It is time for the Church to reassess its stance on these issues, to find a middle ground that will allow it to reconnect with the world and reclaim its place as a beacon of hope and guidance.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, as the world outside recedes into the shadows, the Church must confront the darkness within. It is a darkness that threatens to consume it, to leave it a hollow husk of its former self. But it is also a darkness that holds the seed of redemption, a chance for the Church to rediscover its mission and its purpose. Let us hope that it will seize this opportunity, that it will find a way to heal the schisms and reconnect with the world.",
            "The query of marriage. A fissure in the bedrock of our societal edifice. I find myself pondering this issue, torn asunder by the conflicting tides of reason and sentiment. As I sit in the desolate silence, the ash-strewn landscape stretching out before me like a funereal shroud, I am drawn to the notion that the manner in which one is born is not a choice, but a cold, unforgiving fact. Like the wind that howls through the barren trees, it is a force beyond our control, a primal urge that cannot be tempered by human will.\n\nIn this bleak and unforgiving world, I believe it is our duty to acknowledge and respect the intrinsic nature of those around us. To hold individuals accountable for their orientation is to impose a moral judgment, a notion that seems as futile as attempting to stem the tide of a raging river. The fluidity of existence is a mystery that defies our understanding, and to try to impose our own morality upon it is to risk being consumed by its turbulent depths.\n\nThe federal government, with its heavy hand and broad brush, seems an ill-equipped arbiter of this issue. Their involvement is a clumsy intrusion, a clumsy attempt to impose order on a chaos that resists our comprehension. It is a question of personal liberty, not national security or moral rectitude, and thus falls outside the purview of their authority.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of basic humanity. To deny individuals their right to love and be loved, to be who they are without fear of reprisal or condemnation, is to deny the very essence of our shared experience. And so, like the wind that blows through the desolate landscape, I am drawn to the notion that this is a matter of simple decency, a fundamental aspect of our shared humanity that cannot be legislated or regulated away.",
            "In this desolate expanse of our world, where the crumbling edifices of morality stand as hollow testaments to the transience of values, the question of gay marriage lingers, a festering wound that refuses to heal. It is a debate that has been reduced to a cacophony of sound bites, a jumbled mess of half-truths and misconceptions, where the voices of reason are drowned out by the din of ignorance.\n\nBut amidst this chaos, a glimmer of sense can be found. It is a simple truth, one that has been lost in the mire of fear and prejudice: that love knows no bounds, neither those of sex nor those of creed. It is a force that transcends the petty squabbles of humanity, a flame that burns bright and true, unencumbered by the shackles of societal expectation.\n\nThe arguments against gay marriage are legion, a litany of half-baked excuses and crackpot theories, each one a feeble attempt to justify the unjustifiable. The notion that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family is nothing but a red herring, a canard perpetuated by those who would seek to maintain their grip on power. It is a tired, threadbare argument, one that has been disproven time and time again by the simple fact of existence.\n\nAnd yet, it persists. Like a festering wound, it refuses to heal, a constant reminder of the dark underbelly of human nature. But it is a wound that can be healed, one that can be cauterized by the simple act of compassion and understanding.\n\nThe scientific studies are clear: gay couples are just as capable of sustained, fulfilling relationships as their heterosexual counterparts. They share the same hopes, the same dreams, the same fears. They are not somehow inherently different, nor are they somehow lesser. They are human beings, just as we are, with all the frailties and vulnerabilities that come with it.\n\nAnd yet, the debate rages on, fueled by the passions of the ignorant and the bigoted. It is a debate that has nothing to do with the rights of individuals, but rather with the power of the state to dictate what is and is not acceptable. It is a debate that has been hijacked by the zealots, who would seek to impose their will on the rest of us.\n\nBut it is a futile effort, one that will ultimately be doomed to failure. For the truth will out, no matter how hard we try to bury it. The fact is that gay marriage is not about the rights of the individual, but about the fundamental human right to love and be loved in return. It is about the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of their creed, their color, or their orientation.\n\nAnd so, as we stumble through this dark world, as we navigate the minefield of morality and ethics, we must remember this simple truth: that love is the one constant that binds us all together. It is the one thing that can transcend the petty squabbles of humanity, that can bring us together in a shared humanity.\n\nIn the end, it is not about the politics of it all, nor is it about the religious fervor that drives so many to oppose it. It is about the simple, human need to love and be loved. It is about the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of who they are or who they love.\n\nIn this desolate expanse of our world, where the crumbling edifices of morality stand as hollow testaments to the transience of values, this is the one thing that remains constant: the human heart, beating with a love that knows no bounds.",
            "The pharmacy I work at during the summer months is a place where the boundaries between life and death are blurred. It's a place where the very fabric of existence is stretched thin, where the threads of hope and despair are intertwined. I've seen it time and time again - the desperation in the eyes of those who come seeking solace in the pills and potions we dispense. But it's a double-edged sword, one that cuts both ways. For every life it saves, it takes another. The line between benefit and harm is a thin one, and it's a line that's often crossed.\n\nThe illegal nature of a drug, I've come to realize, is no guarantee of its inherent value. There are many substances, like oxycodone and Vicodin, that are forbidden yet still find their way into our pharmacy. We use them because they possess certain... let's call them \"properties\" that make them beneficial to our patients. But what of marijuana, that most vilified of substances? Is it not worthy of the same consideration?\n\nThe parallels between marijuana and alcohol are often drawn, but they're a false one. Both can be abused, yes, but the latter is a poison that ravages the soul as much as the body. Marijuana, on the other hand, is a substance that can be harnessed, its benefits realized with restraint. The key, I firmly believe, lies in education and understanding. If we can peel away the stigma, the taboo that surrounds it, perhaps we can unlock its true potential.\n\nBut how do we do this? By embracing it wholeheartedly, without reservation? I think not. No, the path forward lies in gradual integration, a measured approach that balances the desire for freedom with the need for responsibility. Remove the shackles of prohibition, and we risk unleashing a torrent of abuse. But by allowing it, in measured doses, we may yet find a way to harness its benefits.\n\nThe images that surround marijuana are distorted, a caricature of the truth. It's not the devil's weed, as some would have you believe, but a plant with its own unique properties and potential. And it's precisely this potential that we should be exploring, not demonizing. For in the end, it's not the substance itself that's the problem, but our own perceptions of it.",
            "The church, a monument to the shifting tides of time, has surrendered to the whims of the twenty-first century. Its once-imposing façade now yields to the casualities of modernity. Gone are the days of strict adherence to tradition; the hushed tones of reverence give way to the murmur of the mundane. I recall Sundays spent in the pews of my youth, the ritual of dressing in my best attire a testament to the gravity of the occasion. My mother would fuss over my outfit, ensuring that I was presented to the world with the dignity befitting a child of the Lord. The private school I attended added to the sense of formality, where on weekends I would reunite with friends clad in our finest Sunday finery.\n\nBut times change, and the church has adapted, its services shrinking to a mere thirty minutes, a concession to the fleeting nature of attention spans. The summer months bring an influx of beachwear, a far cry from the starched collars and high-button shoes of yesteryear. Even the morning masses, once a bastion of tradition, have given way to the informality of jeans and khakis. It is a sea change, one that I neither condone nor lament, merely acknowledge.\n\nAs for the issue of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I believe it is a canker that cannot be excised by a simple change in policy. The institution has been beset by scandal, and it is a tragedy that these atrocities could have been perpetrated under the very roof of the Lord. Some might suggest that allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry could have mitigated these instances, but I fear it is a chimera. Pedophilia is a fundamental aspect of human nature, a flaw that cannot be rectified by the mere trappings of societal norms.\n\nI recall a television show, Seventh Heaven, where a reverend was depicted as a married man of the cloth. It seemed a quaint notion, a far cry from the strictures of the Catholic Church. But even in that context, the reverend's marital status did not preclude him from his duties as a spiritual leader. It is a distinction without a difference; the underlying impulse remains the same.\n\nI believe that pedophilia is an inescapable aspect of human biology, a product of genetics rather than environment. It is a notion that cannot be altered by the trappings of social convention. The church, in all its forms, must confront this reality head-on, acknowledging the darkness that lurks within its midst. To pretend otherwise is to court disaster.\n\nAs I ponder the Catholic Church, I am left with a sense of sorrow and disillusionment. The institution has failed in its duty to protect the most vulnerable, and for that, it will forever bear the stain of shame. But I do not believe that it is a matter of policy or procedure; it is a fundamental failing of humanity itself.",
            "The embers of a once burning fire had long since dwindled to cold ash, and the embers of truth were no less extinguished. The precipice from which we leapt into the chasm of Iraq was shrouded in a mist of deceit, its precipitating factor the aftermath of September 11th. The administration's glib supposition, that the war was a direct response to the attacks, had been a mere pretext, a paltry attempt to obscure the true intent.\n\nA certain duplicity had become a defining characteristic of the Bush administration, their penchant for deception having left a trail of ruin in its wake. The specter of malfeasance hung heavy, as the very fabric of our democracy was strained to its breaking point. Even the stalwart Colin Powell, now an apostate from the fold, had publicly confessed to harboring doubts regarding the veracity of the evidence presented at the UN.\n\nThe Constitution, that sacred document upon which our nation was founded, was wilfully disregarded, its principles and protections callously cast aside. The administration's actions were a betrayal of the very oath they had sworn to uphold, an affront to the concept of truth and accountability. It was a brazen attempt to supplant the rule of law with the rule of whim, a reckless disregard for the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe instrumentalities of power, wielded by an administration hell-bent on self-aggrandizement, had been used to further their own interests, rather than the interests of the nation they claimed to serve. The specter of a 'blood vengeance' against Saddam Hussein loomed large, a vendetta born of the past, and a hunger for power that would stop at nothing.\n\nThe war, a catastrophic and misguided endeavor, had dragged on for far too long, its costs in blood and treasure incalculable. The prospect of withdrawal was fraught with peril, the very real possibility of civil war and further bloodshed hanging in the balance. The nascent government, a fragile and ephemeral thing, teetered on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty hanging precariously in the balance.\n\nA coalition of surrounding nations, a Faustian bargain, was touted as the solution, a panacea for the ills that had been wrought. But this would only serve to sow the seeds of future discord, as the very notion of Iraqi sovereignty was cast aside, and the nation was plunged into further chaos.\n\nIn the midst of this maelstrom, the once-promising interim government was reduced to a mere shell of its former self, a hollow husk devoid of authority or direction. The Parliament, a shadow of its former self, was riven by factional squabbles, its effectiveness nonexistent. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, wielded little real power, as the radical elements, still vying for control, continued to sow discord and instability.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves lost in a wilderness of confusion, our national discourse reduced to a cacophony of sound and fury, signifying nothing. The truth, that most elusive of commodities, had been lost in the maelstrom, leaving us to pick up the pieces of a shattered nation, and to wonder if redemption was even possible.",
            "In the hollow of his chest, a faint murmur stirred. He strained to think of the war in Iraq, to grasp the threads of his thoughts and weave them into a coherent tapestry. The silence was oppressive, a weight that pressed upon his mind like the ashes that shrouded the land. He sought to speak, to articulate the turmoil that churned within him, but the words refused to come.\n\nHe began, haltingly, his voice a tentative whisper. It feels pointless, he said, this war that raged across the desert sands. No declaration, no formal call to arms, just a maelstrom of blood and fire that consumed all in its path. And for what? To impose our will upon a people, to force upon them a democracy that would be nothing more than a pale imitation of our own? The thought was galling, a bitter taste that soured his mouth.\n\nBut then, too, he thought of the families, the sons and daughters who had been torn from their homes, sent to fight in a war that seemed without purpose. And the people of Iraq, their lives shattered, their cities reduced to rubble. He felt a pang of guilt, a sense of responsibility for the destruction that had been wrought.\n\nAnd yet, he couldn't shake the feeling that we were meddling, imposing our values upon a culture that was not our own. The Al-Kaida threat loomed, a specter that seemed to grow more menacing with each passing day. The more we stayed, the more we risked being drawn into a quagmire, a never-ending cycle of violence and hate.\n\nHe trailed off, his thoughts consumed by the silence. The ash swirled around him, a reminders of the desolation that had been wrought. He felt lost, adrift in a world that seemed to be spinning out of control.\n\nIn the end, he couldn't say what he thought, couldn't find the words to articulate the turmoil that churned within him. He simply sat, lost in the darkness, the ash falling around him like a shroud. [END]",
            "The notion of government intervention in matters of faith strains against the worn fabric of our nation's founding principles. The constitution's clause of separation of church and state stands as a bulwark against the entanglement of the two, safeguarding the freedom of conscience that has come to define us. It's a notion, stark and clear, that the government should not usurp the authority of the churches, but rather allow them to chart their own course.\n\nTo attempt to codify a ban on certain practices, to wield the power of the state against the churches, would be an affront to the very foundation of our democracy. It would be a declaration that one faith's conviction trumps the convictions of another, a notion abhorrent to the tolerant spirit that has long defined our nation.\n\nThe constitution, that revered and oft-repeated text, is a clarion call to the virtues of freedom and the free exercise of conscience. To amend it now, to impose a restriction on the people, would be a perversion of its intent. It would be an amendment born of expediency, not principle, and would serve only to restrict the very people it purports to protect.\n\nThe government's role is not to dictate the terms of faith, but to safeguard the rights of all its citizens to worship as they see fit. The president's push for such an amendment reeks of a bias, a preference for one faith over another. It is a move born of personal conviction, not a desire to serve the greater good.\n\nThe economy, the society, the very fabric of our nation would be better served by leaving the churches to their own devices. For it is in the free exercise of faith, unimpeded by the heavy hand of government, that we find true strength and resilience. The notion that such an amendment would somehow boost the economy or improve society is a tenuous at best, and one that does little to justify the infringement on the rights of the people.\n\nIn the end, it is the churches that must be left to decide their own course, unfettered by the dictates of the state. Anything less would be an affront to the very principles that have come to define us as a nation.",
            "In the desolate landscape of our time, the war in Iraq lies like a festering wound, a scar that refuses to heal. The memories of September 11th, 2001, still linger in the air, a palpable fog that shrouds the truth. The government, a behemoth with a penchant for deception, sought to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks, exploiting the collective grief of the American people. But the connection was tenuous at best, a flimsy thread that snapped beneath the weight of reality.\n\nAs the years went by, the war in Iraq unfolded like a macabre dance, a repetition of the same mistakes made in Vietnam. The government, once again, failed to learn from its past blunders, blind to the consequences of its actions. The soldiers, the brave men and women who fought and died, were mere pawns in a game of power and politics.\n\nTheir deaths, countless and senseless, a grim reminder of the government's hubris. The removal of the Iraqi government, a catastrophic event that left a power vacuum, a chasm that the US was ill-prepared to fill. The aftermath, a maelstrom of chaos and violence, a testament to the government's shortsightedness.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a war that should never have been, a war that was fought on false pretenses. The search for weapons of mass destruction, a mirage that vanished upon closer inspection. The real reason, the true motivation, the lust for oil, a hidden truth that only the most perceptive can see.\n\nAs the years drag on, the casualties mount, the American people are left to wonder: is it worth it? The cost, the human toll, the shattered lives, the families torn apart. The war, a quagmire that seems to have no end, a never-ending cycle of blood and steel.\n\nWe, the people, are left to pick up the pieces, to try to make sense of the madness that has been unleashed. We are naive to believe that democracy can be imposed, that it can be forced upon a people who have not asked for it. We are naive to think that the government will always act with truth and integrity.\n\nIn the end, it is not the war that is the problem, but the lies that led to it, the deceit that shrouds our government, the corruption that permeates our institutions. The war in Iraq is a symptom of a larger disease, a disease that infects us all, a disease of greed, of power, of control.\n\nLet us hope that one day, we will learn from our mistakes, that we will find the courage to confront the truth, to face the darkness that lies within ourselves. Let us hope that the war in Iraq will be a lesson, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power, of the importance of truth and integrity. But until then, we are left to suffer the consequences of our actions, to wander in the desolate landscape of our own making.",
            "The thing is, I don't believe in the constraints of others. I've always thought that love is love, regardless of the specifics. It's personal, a string that binds two souls together. And what's the nature of that string, anyway? Is it something we're born with, a thread of DNA that weaves through our very being? Or is it something we cultivate, a garden of emotions that grow and flourish with time? I think it's a mix of both, a dance of fate and choice.\n\nI've seen it in my own life, the way people live, the way they love. My neighbors, good people, two men living together, just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they tend their garden, they love each other just as any other couple would. And what business is it of mine, or anyone else's, to say otherwise? The President, with his interpretations and his moralities, trying to tell us what marriage means. It's a farce, a charade, a mockery of the very concept.\n\nI've read the studies, the research, the statistics. It's not just a matter of choice, not just a matter of upbringing. There's something biological at play, a chemical whisper in the brain that guides us. And what's wrong with that? Is it not the same as a preference for the color blue or the taste of strawberries? Why should we deny people their fundamental right to love, just because it doesn't fit our narrow definitions?\n\nAnd what of the rest of us, the ones who are comfortable in our own skin, who don't need the validation of society to define our relationships? Shouldn't we be free to live our lives as we see fit, without the weight of others' judgment? Marriage, in the end, is a personal thing, a private contract between two people. It's not for the government to dictate, not for the media to sensationalize. It's a matter of love, of commitment, of two people choosing to spend their lives together.\n\nSo, I say, let us not concern ourselves with the specifics. Let us not try to define what love looks like, what it feels like. Let us simply allow people to be, to love as they choose, without fear of reprisal or rejection. It's a basic human right, after all, and one that we should be proud to defend.",
            "In the vast and unyielding expanse of the digital realm, a singular truth holds sway: once set loose, the words of a man can become the wind that rustles the leaves of countless minds. This is a reality that I have come to know all too well in my role as a resident advisor, where the delicate balance between freedom and responsibility is ever-shifting. When words are breathed into the ether of the internet, they assume a life of their own, unbound by the constraints of time and space. In this boundless expanse, the distinction between jest and earnest intent becomes increasingly tenuous, and the lines between public and private blur like the edges of a forgotten photograph.\n\nAs I've witnessed firsthand, the careless utterance can spark a maelstrom of consequences, as the whispers of a single individual can fan the flames of anxiety and concern among those who would listen. The notion that one's words might be overheard, misinterpreted, or misconstrued by a stranger is a specter that haunts us all, a constant reminder that our thoughts and sentiments are never truly our own once they've been set free.\n\nThe ease with which information can be disseminated, shared, and scrutinized has created a world where one's digital footprint can be traversed at will, stripped bare of its context and reduced to a series of isolated words, each one a potential detonator waiting to ignite the powder keg of public opinion. And in this precarious landscape, the notion of privacy becomes a mirage, a fleeting dream that vanishes upon closer inspection.\n\nIn this regard, the actions of school officials who monitor the digital lives of their students can be seen as both a necessary evil and a brazen invasion of personal space. While it is true that the creation of social media accounts under a pseudonym or the friending of students on Myspace or Facebook can be seen as a delicate balancing act, it is also a reality that the world will not be bound by the confines of a school's walls. When concerns are brought to light, they must be addressed, lest the consequences of inaction prove catastrophic.\n\nIn the end, it is not the act of monitoring itself that is the issue, but rather the manner in which it is executed. The lines between guidance and surveillance are often blurred, leaving one to wonder: where does concern end and intrusion begin? As a resident advisor, I have come to realize that the answer lies not in the act of monitoring itself, but in the context in which it is applied. The delicate dance between freedom and responsibility is a tightrope that must be walked with care, lest the consequences of a misstep prove disastrous.",
            "The war, a drawn-out odyssey besmirched by time. Its purpose, once a beacon of hope, now lost to the murk of ambiguity. We were to be the liberators, the bringers of democracy to a people shackled by tyranny. But the days have turned to years, and the years to an endless expanse of desolation. Our actions, no longer driven by the pure intention of freedom, have been sullied by the stain of self-interest.\n\nWe speak of restoring democracy, but what of the motives that led us down this treacherous path? Were they not tainted by the complexities of power and the personal vendettas of the past? George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, their animosity a festering wound that refused to heal. And so we found ourselves entangled in a quagmire, our purpose diluted by the weight of our own ambitions.\n\nIn the beginning, we made a statement, a declaration of our intent to bring light to a world shrouded in darkness. But time has worn away at our resolve, and we are now mired in the quicksand of indecision. We yearn for a decisive victory, a triumphant end to this conflict, but the truth is, our purpose has been lost to the sands of time.\n\nWe spend billions upon billions, draining our own economy, as our own people suffer. We pour our treasure into a war that has long since lost its justification. The people of the country we sought to liberate are left to fend for themselves, while we squander our resources on a conflict that has become a hollow shell of its former self.\n\nWar is not a luxury we can afford, not in a world where poverty and neglect cry out for attention. We have our own wounds to heal, our own battles to fight. The money we spend on this war could be better spent on schools, on roads, on healthcare, on the very fabric of our own society. And so we are left to ponder the cost of our actions, to wonder if the ends justify the means, and to pray that one day we will find our way back to the purpose that once drove us.\n\nWe are not the liberators we once claimed to be, but rather the perpetrators of a conflict that has lost its way. Our actions, no longer guided by the pure intention of freedom, have become a mere exercise in futility, a testament to the destructive power of human ambition. And so we are left to wonder, what have we accomplished, and at what cost?",
            "The notion that one's life might be saved by the prying eyes of a stranger on the internet, it's a notion that hangs like a specter over the landscape of our modern existence. A specter born of the whispers and warnings that echo through the digital halls, a cautionary tale of the perils that lurk in the shadows of the online world.\n\nIn the virtual realm, we surrender a portion of our lives to the void, allowing the gaze of others to fall upon us like a cold, unforgiving wind. We post and share, we reveal and conceal, all under the guise of convenience and connection. But in doing so, we also invite the unwanted gaze of strangers, their eyes upon us like a chill in the darkness.\n\nConsider the example of Myspace, a platform where one's profile can be accessed by anyone who knows the password, a password shared with friends and acquaintances, a password that grants permission to those who would seek to intrude upon our private lives. And yet, even with such safeguards in place, the boundaries between public and private begin to blur, the lines between consent and invasion growing increasingly indistinct.\n\nIt's a difficult balance to strike, one that weighs the need for connection against the fear of exposure. We yearn for the intimacy of the online world, the ease of communication and the sense of community it provides. And yet, we also fear the prying eyes that lurk in the shadows, the strangers who would seek to exploit our vulnerabilities and manipulate our trust.\n\nThe question remains, is it an invasion of privacy to monitor an individual's online activity, to scour their profile for signs of danger or deceit? Or is it a necessary measure, a means of protecting the vulnerable from those who would seek to harm them? The answer, much like the digital landscape itself, is shrouded in uncertainty, a labyrinth of gray areas and conflicting perspectives.\n\nAs one who has traversed this digital expanse, I can attest to the treacherous nature of online interactions. The ease with which strangers can access our personal information, the ways in which they can manipulate and deceive. It's a world where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are constantly shifting, where the lines between consent and coercion are repeatedly blurred.\n\nAnd yet, even with these risks in mind, I still find myself drawn to the online world, a world that offers a sense of connection and community that is hard to find elsewhere. It's a double-edged sword, one that cuts both ways, offering the promise of intimacy and the threat of invasion.\n\nIn the end, it's a delicate balance, one that requires a constant negotiation between the need for connection and the fear of exposure. A balance that is as fragile as the digital threads that bind us together, as ephemeral as the whispers that echo through the online halls.",
            "In the bleak expanse of a forgotten landscape, the echoes of war linger. The Iraq War, a calamity of grand proportions, casts a long shadow over the world. It was a disaster from its inception, a calamity born of hubris and blind ambition. The consensus was clear: the invasion was a bad idea, a folly that would only lead to more suffering and chaos.\n\nPolls from across the globe bear witness to this fact. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population views the war as a catastrophic mistake. The Iraqi people, the very ones we sought to liberate, now overwhelmingly demand our departure. Even the soldiers who fought in the conflict, a staggering seventy percent, believe the war was a grave error, and that we should extricate ourselves within the year.\n\nYet, like the ghostly apparitions that haunt the ruins of a forgotten city, the war's remnants cling to life. A culture clash of epic proportions has taken hold, a chasm so vast that it defies comprehension. The United States, with its vaunted ideals of democracy, has attempted to impose its will upon a people who would rather chart their own course. The result has been a quagmire, a quagmire of endless suffering and bloodshed.\n\nThe administration's justification for remaining in Iraq is a tangle of half-truths and unconvincing arguments. They speak of stability and security, but these are mere shibboleths, empty words that ring hollow in the face of reality. The people of Iraq have spoken, and their voices are clear: leave us be.\n\nIf we continue to occupy their land, we risk perpetuating the very cycle of violence and chaos we sought to eradicate. The statistics are stark: eighty percent of Iraqis demand our departure within the year, and a quarter of them urge us to leave immediately. These are the people we claim to be liberating, the people we claim to be saving. Do we not listen to their pleas?\n\nPerhaps it is time to acknowledge that our presence in Iraq has been a disaster, a calamity that will only continue to unfold if we remain. We have been told that we are the good guys, that we are the bringers of democracy and freedom. But the truth is more nuanced, more complicated. We are a power, a force that has imposed its will upon a people who would rather live under their own terms.\n\nThe time has come to extricate ourselves from this quagmire. We must listen to the voices of the Iraqi people, to the soldiers who have fought and bled for a cause that has lost all sense. We must acknowledge the reality of our failure, and begin the long and arduous process of withdrawal.\n\nFor in the end, it is not our presence that has brought stability to Iraq, but rather our absence. It is our departure that will allow the Iraqi people to chart their own course, to forge their own destiny. Only then can we hope to redeem ourselves, to find a glimmer of redemption in the ashes of our failure.",
            "In a land ravaged by the fetid breath of prejudice, where the stench of inequality clings to every surface, the specter of gender bias haunts the streets of America. It is a cancer, festering in the marrow of society, its tendrils snaking into every crevice of the workaday world. The glass ceiling, that supposedly transparent barrier, still bars the way for women, who toil in the shadows, their talents and abilities obscured by the weight of a millennia-old narrative.\n\nIn the rarefied realm of corporate power, the boardroom elite often prove unwilling to promote women to positions of authority, their decisions guided by a historically entrenched bias that views the feminine as inferior. And yet, this is not a one-way street; men too, in certain industries, are subject to the whims of societal expectation. In the rarefied world of fashion, for instance, a man's interest in the field is often met with skepticism, as if his very masculinity is somehow suspect. His involvement is seen as a novelty, a fleeting aberration from the norm.\n\nIn the domestic sphere, the traditional division of labor often renders stay-at-home fathers vulnerable to ridicule and scorn. The societal expectation that men must be breadwinners, providers, is a heavy burden to bear, and one that can weigh heavily on the male half of the equation. Why, the critics ask, would a man choose to abandon his masculine duties and devote himself to childcare? The answer, of course, is that he may simply wish to be present, to nurture and guide his children as they grow and develop. But this is a notion that society has yet to fully grasp.\n\nAs we navigate the labyrinthine corridors of progress, it becomes clear that change is a slow and arduous process. The needle of equality has moved, incrementally, over the years, but there is still much work to be done. Women have made strides in the corporate world, taking on leadership roles and shattering glass ceilings. But the journey is far from over. Men, too, are beginning to re-evaluate their roles, questioning the traditional expectations placed upon them.\n\nIn this delicate dance of social evolution, it is crucial that we tread carefully, lest we risk alienating those we seek to persuade. To boldly push for change can be counterproductive, often triggering resistance in those who feel threatened by the status quo. Instead, we must strive to highlight the qualities that make individuals exceptional, regardless of their background or biology. By celebrating the unique strengths and talents of those who defy societal norms, we can create a more inclusive, more compassionate world.\n\nIn this fragile balance, we find ourselves at a crossroads. The road ahead is long, winding, and fraught with obstacles. But it is a journey we must undertake, for the sake of our collective humanity. By acknowledging the many faces of discrimination, we can begin to chip away at the edifice of prejudice, one small step at a time. And though the progress may be slow, it is a journey worth taking, for in the end, it is only by embracing our differences that we may truly find common ground.",
            "The laws changed, a shift in the current. Decriminalization, they called it. The weight of the law, no longer crushing. The man's hands, freed from the chains of oppression, now grasped the reins of reason. It was no longer a felony, but a mere infraction, a speed ticket to be dealt with and forgotten. The people worried about the consequences, the stains on their records, the whispers of disapproval. But the cost of arrest, of prosecution, of incarceration, a heavy burden, one that could be lifted. The municipalities, struggling to stay afloat, saw the sense in it. The city of Denver, a bastion of progress, a place where the wind of change blew strong, where the people were open-minded, where the chains of tradition were shed. And so they moved forward, leaving behind the shackles of the past.\n\nBut the debate raged on, a tempest in a teapot. Some said it was a slippery slope, a Pandora's box that would unleash a torrent of chaos upon the land. The streets would be choked with the stench of smoke, the air thick with the haze of euphoria. The motor skills of the drivers would falter, the roads a battleground of accidents and mayhem. And the society, already fragile, would crumble under the weight of this new freedom.\n\nBut others saw it differently, a glass half full, a cup overflowing with possibilities. The money, once spent on the war on drugs, could be poured into the streams of education, of social programs, of food for the hungry. The people, once imprisoned, could be free, their minds unshackled, their creativity unbridled. And the city, once a wasteland of despair, could bloom, a garden of hope and opportunity.\n\nI myself am torn, a ship tossed on the waves of doubt. I see the arguments on both sides, the pros and cons, the for and against. But as I stand on the shore, looking out at the sea of uncertainty, I am drawn to the tide of progress. The future, like the horizon, stretches out before us, a vast expanse of possibility. And I believe that we must move forward, into the unknown, with hope in our hearts and the wind at our backs.",
            "In the hush of reflection, I find myself standing at the precipice of tradition. The echoes of the past reverberate, reminding me that many of the actions we undertake are rooted in a bygone era. Like the worn grooves of a well-traveled path, these customs have been etched into our collective psyche, their familiarity a comforting certainty. Yet, it is equally essential to acknowledge the necessity of adaptability, to bend with the winds of change like a withered branch yielding to the tempest.\n\nIn the Catholic faith, tradition is a sacred trust, a set of dogma handed down through the ages. The expectation is clear: attend Mass each Sunday, adhere to the doctrine, and be judged by the strictest of standards. But beneath the surface, a discordant note resonates – a dissonance born of contradiction. For while the Church preaches love and acceptance, its practices often falter, excluding those who do not conform, those whose devotion is deemed imperfect.\n\nMy own family's story is a testament to this paradox. My parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian, were barred from marrying in the Catholic Church due to my father's denomination. The harsh judgment of the Church's rigid expectations left a bitter taste, a reminder that its teachings often fall short of its ideals. The lesson learned was clear: the pursuit of love and acceptance is often at odds with the strictures of tradition.\n\nAs I ponder the role of priests, I am drawn to the question of their marital status. Permitting them to marry might alleviate some of the suffering that has plagued the Church, but would it truly prevent the aberrant behavior of those who would harm children? I fear not, for the corruption of the heart is a burden that cannot be easily lifted. The pedophilic tendencies of some may be a manifestation of deeper, more complex issues, and marriage, or the lack thereof, is merely a symptom, not a cause.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that holds the key to redemption, but rather a fundamental shift in values, a recognition that love and acceptance know no bounds, that the dignity of every soul is paramount. The Church's adherence to tradition, while comforting to some, must not come at the expense of its most vulnerable members. As I reflect on this complex web of doctrine and practice, I am left with a sense of unease, a feeling that the Church's rigid stance on marriage and family is a mere facade, a veil that conceals the true depths of its convictions.",
            "The mire of this conundrum has left me lost in its stagnant waters. The weight of the question presses upon me like a physical force, an unseen hand that pinches at the joints of my mind. Separation of church and state, a delicate balance that teeters on the precipice of offense, a tremulous dance between the sacred and the secular. And at the heart of it all, the sacrament of marriage, a bond forged in the fire of devotion, a union of flesh and soul. Can it be reduced to a civil contract, a mere trifle of state recognition? Must the government's gaze be turned away, refusing to sully its eyes with the intimate details of love?\n\nI am torn, a leaf caught in the whirlpool of opposing currents. The idea of marriage as a civil union seems a paltry thing, a shallow imitation of the true bond that exists between two souls. And yet, can the state truly be expected to recognize the sacrament, to confer upon it a status that transcends the mundane? The impulse to separate church and state, to keep the sacred and the profane apart, is a noble one. But does it not risk reducing the human experience to a mere cipher, a series of sterile abstractions?\n\nThe notion of gay marriage stirs up a tempest within me, a maelstrom of conflicting emotions. Is it not a union of two people, a bond that should be recognized and respected, regardless of the trappings of tradition or convention? And yet, can it be said that this union is the same as that of any other couple, that the government's recognition of it would not somehow sully the very fabric of society?\n\nThe call for a federal law, a logical conclusion arrived at through the aggregation of state opinions, seems a palatable solution. But a constitutional amendment, a sweeping change to the foundation of our society, seems an overreach, a reaction born of passion rather than reason. To amend the constitution for this cause alone seems a gross overstatement, a recognition of the importance of this issue that I do not share.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, lost in the mire of this conundrum. The question of gay marriage, like the question of the separation of church and state, is a complex and multifaceted one, a Gordian knot that resists easy solution. I can offer no clear answer, only the murmur of doubts and uncertainties that haunt me like a specter.",
            "I grew up in a household where faith was a guiding force, and as such, I've grappled with the concept of homosexuality in a manner both introspective and ambivalent. My relationships with individuals who identify as gay have fostered a certain familiarity, yet I've come to realize that my own stance on the matter is complex and multifaceted. I do not entirely condone the lifestyle, but I firmly believe that it should be a decision left to the discretion of each individual state, rather than a federal mandate.\n\nI understand that our nation is comprised of diverse states, each with their own unique values and ideologies. Democratic states, for instance, tend to lean more progressive on issues such as gay marriage. Were one to reside in a state that has chosen to legalize gay marriage, I believe it would be prudent to respect their decision, for it is a choice one makes by residing within that state's borders.\n\nMy stance is not that homosexuality should be universally accepted or condemned; rather, I believe that individuals should be afforded the same opportunities and rights as their heterosexual counterparts. Therefore, the decision to legalize gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state, allowing them to govern their own affairs without undue federal interference.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the president's views on the matter should not supersede the will of individual states. The notion that President Bush's stance on gay marriage should dictate a nationwide policy seems misguided, as he represents but one aspect of our federal government. Ultimately, it is the states themselves that must live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president. Thus, I firmly believe that each state should have the autonomy to decide its own stance on gay marriage, free from federal overreach.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not support a blanket nationwide ban on gay marriage. Instead, I advocate for a system where individual states are empowered to make their own decisions, allowing for a more nuanced and diverse approach to this complex issue.",
            "The notion that posting on Myspace is a public thing is a notion that I do not at all subscribe to. I suppose it's a notion that's been drummed into our collective consciousness - that anything one posts on the internet is fair game for anyone to see. But that's not entirely true.\n\nWhen one posts something on the internet, whether it be a bulletin or a simple message, that action is not without consequence. It's akin to shouting one's innermost thoughts from the mountaintop - anything that escapes the confines of the digital realm can be seen and heard by anyone who dares to listen.\n\nAnd it's precisely this notion that I think the school officials had a right to consider when they accessed my Myspace profile. Even if I wasn't posting under the school's name, the fact remains that they could have accessed it from their homes, and that's a distinction without a difference. The fact that they were keeping a watchful eye on their students' online activities is not an invasion of privacy, but rather a necessary measure to ensure the safety of those in their care.\n\nI recall a conversation I had with a teacher of mine at my public high school, in which we discussed the necessity of monitoring students' online activities. We talked about how lock downs and drills were put in place to prepare for the unthinkable, and how those measures were a direct response to the fear of terrorist attacks and school shootings. I see the school officials' actions as an extension of that same logic - a proactive measure to prevent anything bad from happening.\n\nThe fact that I may have posted something on Myspace that I didn't intend for school officials to see is beside the point. The truth is, once something is on the internet, it's always there, waiting to be discovered. And I'd be foolish to think that my words wouldn't have consequences. It's a risk we all take when we post online, and it's one that I'm not naive enough to ignore.\n\nIn the end, I think the school officials' actions were justified. If it means keeping students safe, then I'm all for it. And that's what I've been trying to say all along - it's a public thing, and we should be aware of the consequences of our actions.",
            "The ghosts of war still linger within me, a specter born of the embers of nine eleven. It was a day that seared my soul, a day that laid bare the abyss that separates us from the chaos that festers beyond our borders. I recall the fervor that gripped me then, a zeal that blinded me to the ruin that would follow. We were a nation bent on vengeance, driven by a hunger for retribution that would only be satiated by the destruction of others. But in the aftermath, I came to see the folly of our endeavors. The flames of war had been fanned by emotions, not reason, and we marched forward with a zealot's fervor, unprepared for the devastation that would be wrought.\n\nIn the crucible of war, I witnessed the contradictions that have long defined our relationship with the world. We speak of progress, of freedom, of democracy, but our actions betray a grim reality: that we are a people bent on imposing our will upon others, rather than listening to their stories, their struggles, and their hopes. The people of Iraq, I came to realize, were not our enemies, but rather, they were us – flawed, imperfect, and torn asunder by our own making.\n\nWe delved into the heart of their world with a recklessness that bordered on savagery, our actions driven by a desire to reshape their destiny, rather than to understand their plight. And in the end, we created a void, a chasm that cannot be bridged. The war has left us with a legacy of blood and ash, a reminder that our power is not a panacea, but a poison that has seeped into the very fabric of their being.\n\nI have come to believe that we are not the saviors we pretend to be, but rather, we are the authors of our own undoing. Our presence has only served to embolden the very factions we sought to vanquish, and our departure will only hasten the collapse of a system that has been forever altered by our interference. We have sown the seeds of discord, and now we reap the whirlwind.\n\nIn the silence of the night, I am haunted by the voices of the dead, their whispers a reminder of the cost of our hubris. I am left to ponder the wisdom of our actions, to question the motives that drove us forward, and to wonder if we have been foolish to believe that we could impose our will upon the world. The ghosts of war still linger, a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that the price of our pride may be higher than we can bear."
