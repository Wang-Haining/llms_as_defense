            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the depths of a world where shadows of doubt crept in, where the once unshakeable foundations of the Catholic Church wavered, a whispered question arose. Do they cling to the familiar, or do they surrender to the tides of change? The institution, once a bastion of tradition, now teetered on the precipice, its grip on the faithful beginning to loosen. The winds of time howled through its halls, casting aspersions on the Church's rigid stance on matters of the heart.\n\nLike a withered leaf, the Church's views on certain issues – the sanctity of life, the bonds of love, the sacraments of birth and death – seemed to cling tenuously to the branches of time, yellowed and brittle. The world outside moved forward, its pace quickening with each passing day, while the Church's stance remained frozen, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIt was said that the faithful were deserting, their numbers dwindling as the Church's rigidity only served to drive them further away. The din of dissent grew louder, a cacophony of voices that echoed through the desolate landscape of a world in flux. The Church's stance on matters of the heart seemed to be an anachronism, a stubborn refusal to bend in the face of changing times.\n\nOne could not help but wonder, in a world where love and compassion were the guiding principles, why the Church clung so tenaciously to its dogma. Why, in a world where the bonds of family and community were stretched taut, did the Church insist on its doctrine of celibacy? The question hung in the air, a challenge to the very fabric of the institution.\n\nThe winds of change howled on, a maelstrom that threatened to consume the Church whole. And yet, in the midst of the turmoil, a glimmer of hope flickered, a whispered promise that the Church might yet find a way to adapt, to bend without breaking. For in a world where love and acceptance were the keys to salvation, perhaps the Church's greatest challenge lay not in resisting the tides of change, but in embracing them.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, where the very foundations of the Church trembled, a question echoed through the void: could the Catholic Church find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the demands of a new world? Or would it succumb to the weight of its own rigidity, lost in a sea of time? Only the future held the answer, a future that hung precariously in the balance, like a leaf on the winds of change.",
            "The world is not a canvas for our petty judgments. It is a tapestry of complexities, woven from threads of fate and circumstance. And yet, we find ourselves drawn into the vortex of moral absolutes, our minds grasping for certainties in a sea of uncertainty. I, like many, have found myself adrift in this maelstrom, struggling to find footing on the shifting sands of opinion. The question of gay marriage, a topic that has gained prominence in these tumultuous times, has been a source of consternation for me.\n\nAs I ponder the issue, I am reminded of the fundamental truth that we are not born as blank slates, waiting to be inscribed with the characters of our destiny. Our very existence is a tapestry of choices and circumstances, yet there are some things that lie beyond our control. The same goes for the question of sexual orientation. It is a mystery, a labyrinth that we navigate without the benefit of a map or compass. We are not born with the choices of our lives already made, but with the capacity to forge our own path.\n\nThe notion that a person's sexual orientation is a choice, a conscious decision to defy societal norms, strikes me as a fallacy. It is a sentiment that reeks of a narrow-mindedness that seeks to impose its will on the complexities of human nature. Gay people, like all of us, are not aberrations, but rather an integral part of the human experience.\n\nTo deny them the right to marriage, to love, and to live their lives as they see fit, is to perpetuate a false narrative that we are the sole arbiters of what is right and wrong. It is a hubris that forgets that our understanding of the world is but a mere fraction of the grand tapestry. We are not the authors of the script, but merely characters in a story that is being written by forces beyond our comprehension.\n\nThe federal government, in its attempts to regulate the private lives of its citizens, oversteps its bounds. It is not our duty to impose our moral vision on others, but rather to create a society that allows individuals to live their lives as they see fit, so long as they do not harm others. It is a delicate balance, one that requires us to be mindful of our own limitations and the infinite complexities of human nature.\n\nIn the end, it is not for us to judge, but to allow. To create a world where love knows no bounds, where people can be themselves without fear of persecution or marginalization. It is a world that is not yet realized, but one that we must strive for, lest we forget the simple truth that we are all human, bound together by our shared experiences and our capacity for compassion.",
            "In the desolate expanse of this cold and forsaken land, where the tree of reason seems to wither and die, there remains a beacon of hope - the hope for equality, for the unwavering pursuit of justice, and for the unrelenting quest for truth. The issue of gay marriage is a matter of stark simplicity, a binary choice between the light of acceptance and the dark of prejudice. And yet, the fervent opposition to it is a palpable force, a maelstrom of fear and misunderstanding that threatens to consume us all.\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the institution of heterosexual marriage is a canard, a feeble excuse for the intolerance that festers in the hearts of those who cling to the status quo. The truth is, the essence of marriage is not bound by the shackles of biology, but by the indomitable spirit of love and commitment. Two individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, can form a bond that is just as strong, just as deep, and just as worthy of recognition as any other.\n\nThe defense of civil rights is not a partisan issue, nor is it a matter of personal opinion. It is a fundamental human right, a cornerstone of our democracy, and a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of compassion. The struggles of gay couples are not unlike those of any other couple - they face the same trials, the same tribulations, and the same triumphs. And it is precisely this shared humanity that we must acknowledge and celebrate, rather than deny and exclude.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a sacrosanct principle, one that has been enshrined in our Constitution. To allow the government to codify the tenets of a particular faith, be it Christianity or any other, is to invite the kind of hypocrisy that has ravaged our society for far too long. The phrase \"separate but equal\" has been used to justify the most heinous of injustices, and it is our duty to reject its pernicious influence once and for all.\n\nThe fear of the unknown, the fear of change, and the fear of difference are powerful engines of intolerance. They fuel the fires of prejudice, and they fuel the flames of hatred. But they are also the very things that we must confront, that we must overcome, and that we must vanquish if we are to create a society that is just, equitable, and fair for all.\n\nThe scientific community has spoken, and it is clear that homosexual relationships are not inherently defective, nor are they a product of childhood trauma or personal pathology. The American Psychological Association has weighed in, and its findings are unequivocal - the notion that gay people are somehow flawed or inferior is a myth, a lie, and a calumny.\n\nIn the end, it is not about politics, or ideology, or even morality. It is about humanity. It is about our capacity for compassion, our ability to empathize, and our willingness to see the world through the eyes of another. It is about recognizing that we are not so different, that we are all part of a shared human experience, and that our differences are what make us strong, not weak.\n\nSo let us not be swayed by the siren song of fear, of intolerance, and of ignorance. Let us not be deterred by the opposition of those who would seek to deny us our basic human rights. Let us stand tall, let us stand proud, and let us demand that our voices be heard. For in the end, it is not just about gay marriage - it is about the very fabric of our society, and the kind of world we want to create for ourselves and for future generations.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital, a summer's toil, I find myself entwined with the shadows of the pharmacy. The shadows cast by the fluorescent lights, a cold and unforgiving glow that seeps into the very marrow of one's bones. It is here, amidst the sterile counters and the rows of bottles, that I find myself grappling with the complexities of a world in flux. The question that hangs in the air, like a specter, is one of morality and the role of the forbidden. \n\nJust because a substance is proscribed, does it not possess some hidden virtue? Does its utility in the realm of medicine not outweigh the taboos that surround it? I think of the oxycodone and the Vicodin, the Percocet, used by my colleagues with frequency and with purpose. These are drugs, I am told, that hold no place in the world of the uninhibited. Yet, in the world of the hospital, they are nothing short of essential. The distinction, it seems to me, is a curious one.\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is a tired one. We all know the perils of excess, the ruin that can be wrought by overindulgence. But the similarities between the two substances are limited. The danger lies, I think, not in the substance itself, but in the manner of its use. Remove the stigma, the shroud of prohibition, and perhaps, just perhaps, we may find a more responsible path.\n\nThe image of marijuana, a caricature of a substance, held in the public eye, is one of degradation and decay. It is a picture of a world gone mad, of lives ruined by the very thing that might have brought solace. But is this image not a distortion? Is it not a product of our own fears and our own biases? I think of the heroin and the cocaine, the true scourges of our time. The comparison to marijuana is a false one, a convenient smokescreen designed to obscure the truth.\n\nIn the end, it is not the substance itself that is the problem, but our own perceptions, our own fears. Remove the taboos, the shrouds of prohibition, and perhaps, just perhaps, we may find a new path, a path of responsibility and of reason.",
            "The church has undergone a metamorphosis, its staid traditions yielding to the demands of the twenty-first century. The once rigid facade now appears more relaxed, a facade worn down by the gentle lapping of time. As a child, I was accustomed to Sundays spent within its hallowed halls, my attire a pristine, cookie-cutter reflection of the expectations that governed my early years. Matching dresses, shoes, and purses – a uniform that signified not only my belonging but also my devotion. Those were simpler times, ones that waned as I grew older.\n\nAt my private school, I would catch glimpses of my friends on weekends, all of us hurrying to and fro, our footsteps echoing within the church's hallowed walls. But as the years passed, the church adapted, its rituals condensed to thirty minutes, a hurried sacrifice to the pace of modern life. Summer mornings saw families arrive in beach attire, the very emblem of a world in disarray. Even morning masses, once a bastion of propriety, now welcomed the casual, the jeans and khakis a testament to a more relaxed era.\n\nAs I reflect on my experiences, I am struck by the changing times, the church a reflection of the world at large. I do not pretend to understand the inner workings of the church's politics, nor do I wish to delve into the complex web of allegations surrounding its clergy. My observations, though limited, suggest that the church's strictures did little to prevent the scourge of pedophilia.\n\nThe notion that allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference is a notion I find difficult to accept. Pedophilia, I believe, is a product of an individual's nature, a predisposition that cannot be altered by the trappings of marriage or the blessings of the church. Even in faiths that permit marriage among their clergy, the aberrant individual will still find a way to indulge their baser desires. It is a choice, a choice made by the individual, not by the institution.\n\nIn the end, it seems to me that the church's inability to prevent these atrocities lies not in its practices but in the human condition. We are what we are, our inclinations shaped by forces beyond our control, genetics a primary driver of our nature. The church, in its attempts to police the desires of its clergy, may have been misguided, but it was not the root cause of this evil.\n\nAs I reflect on the church's place in the world, I am left with more questions than answers. Its role, once a beacon of hope and guidance, now seems a complex, multifaceted entity, one that must confront the darker aspects of human nature.",
            "The ghosts of September's ash still clung to the land like the stench of death on a winter's morning. The memories of that day, like the embers of a long-dead fire, continued to smolder, refusing to be extinguished. The administration's pyre of deceit had been built upon the altar of fear, and the flames of war had consumed the nation. The rhetoric of lies had been woven like a tapestry of deceit, with Saddam Hussein as the thread, Osama Bin Laden as the hook, and the WMDs as the bait.\n\nThe echoes of Colin Powell's hollow words still lingered in the air, a haunted whisper of a man who knew the truth but chose to ignore it. The evidence, like the desert sand, had shifted and slid, revealing the cracks in the administration's facade. The Constitution, that sacred document, had been cast aside like a worn and tattered cloak, trampled by the boots of power.\n\nThe younger Bush, driven by a vendetta born of blood and pride, had set his sights on Baghdad, his eyes fixed on the prize of oil, that black gold that flowed like lifeblood through the veins of the nation. The pretext, a flimsy thing, had been used to justify the slaughter, the terror, the devastation. The world had been fooled, convinced by the sweet whispers of a lie.\n\nAnd now, as the years had passed, the truth had begun to seep through the cracks, like water through the parched earth. The country teetered on the brink of chaos, a fragile thing, balanced precariously between the competing interests of the nations that had come to claim its prize. The Iraqi government, a fragile leaf, was blown by the winds of dissension, its sovereignty threatened by the very powers that had claimed to liberate it.\n\nThe Parliament, a gathering of disparate voices, was a cacophony of discord, a reminder that the Iraqis were not a people to be trifled with. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, was a mere puppet on a string, pulled by the invisible hands of the foreign powers that had brought him to power. The shadow of al-Sadr loomed large, a specter of rebellion, a reminder that the fire of resistance still burned bright.\n\nAnd so, the nation teetered, a delicate balance of power, a house of cards waiting to be blown down. The ghosts of September still lingered, a reminder of the horrors that had been unleashed. The lies, the deceit, the bloodshed – all of it still echoed through the halls of history, a grim reminder of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "I sat in the cold, my words lost in the void. The wind howled through the trees like a mournful cry, a dirge for the lost and the forgotten. I tried to speak, but the words would not come. Just a hollow murmur, a murmur that was swallowed by the silence.\n\nI cleared my throat, and began again. The War in Iraq. A conflict without end, a morass of blood and ash. I felt a sense of futility, a sense that our efforts were as fleeting as the wind that swept through the desolate landscape.\n\nIt was a war without a clear purpose, a war without a declared end. A war born of anger and revenge, of a desire to punish and to dominate. I thought of the children, the sons and daughters lost in the conflict, their lives forever changed by the violence and the bloodshed.\n\nI thought of the terrible weight of responsibility, the burden of power that rested on the shoulders of those who had unleashed this war. The promise of democracy, of freedom and prosperity, had been reduced to a hollow mantra, a justification for the destruction and the chaos that had been wrought.\n\nAnd yet, I was torn. I felt a sense of loyalty to those who had served, who had risked everything to defend a cause that was noble and just. But I also felt a sense of unease, a sense that our presence in Iraq was a cancer, a poison that was eating away at the very fabric of the country.\n\nI thought of the words of my predecessors, the ones who had spoken of the importance of engagement, of the need to build a better world. But I knew that words were cheap, that the cost of war was measured in blood and tears, not in empty rhetoric.\n\nI sighed, my breath misting in the cold air. The War in Iraq was a labyrinth, a maze of conflicting desires and ideologies. I did not know what to say, what to think. All I knew was that I was lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty and doubt.\n\nI paused, collecting my thoughts. Perhaps, I thought, the war was not just about Iraq, but about us. About our own fears and insecurities, our own need for power and control. Perhaps it was a reflection of our own darkness, our own shadow self.\n\nI looked out at the desolate landscape, the wind-whipped trees and the ash-stained rocks. It was a landscape of death and despair, a landscape that seemed to stretch on forever. And I knew that I was just a small part of it, a small part of a larger tapestry that was torn and frayed.\n\nI fell silent, my words lost in the void. The wind howled on, a mournful cry that seemed to echo through the ages.",
            "In the desolate landscape of politics, a canonical question hangs like a specter, shrouded in the murk of constitutional ambiguity. The separation of church and state, that bedrock principle of the American foundational text, stands as a bulwark against the encroachment of ecclesiastical power into the temporal realm. And yet, a proposed amendment seeks to upset this delicate balance, to insinuate the government's hand into the very fabric of faith, a move that would contravene the sacred compact of separation.\n\nThe constitution, that venerable document, speaks plainly on this matter, its words a testament to the founders' genius and foresight. And yet, in a seeming disregard for the written word, the proponents of this amendment would seek to impose their will, to impose their narrow vision on a nation founded on the principles of liberty and tolerance. The very notion is anathema to the spirit of American democracy, a spirit that prizes freedom above all else.\n\nIn the councils of power, a subtle but insidious force is at work, one that would reduce the rich tapestry of faith to a monolith of state-defined orthodoxy. The irony is not lost on those who would see this amendment as a thinly veiled attempt to privilege one creed over all others. And so they rail against the very idea, seeing in it a testament to the creeping influence of theocracy.\n\nThe economy, that great engine of progress, would be little affected, yet the proposed amendment would have far-reaching consequences, insidiously chipping away at the bedrock of American freedom. The societal impact, too, would be profound, as the very fabric of our national identity would be reshaped by the imposition of a state-defined dogma.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the state to dictate the terms of the divine, nor is it for the government to impose its will on the faithful. The churches, those venerable institutions of faith, must be free to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. For in the words of the constitution, the distinction between church and state is not a suggestion, but a fundamental imperative, a bulwark against the tyranny of the majority and the oppression of the minority.\n\nIn this, the proposed amendment would be a calamity, a betrayal of the trust that has been placed in us as citizens. We must stand against this thinly veiled attempt to subvert the constitution, to undermine the very foundations of our democracy. For in the words of the great American jurist, the constitution is not a document to be tinkered with, but a sacred trust, a beacon of hope in a world beset by darkness and despair.\n\nUltimately, it is not for the federal government, nor any government, to dictate the terms of faith. It is for the churches, those institutions of faith, to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. And so we must resist this amendment, this thinly veiled attempt to impose a state-defined dogma on a nation founded on the principles of liberty and tolerance. For in the end, it is not the state that should dictate the terms of the divine, but the faithful, free to worship as they see fit, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the government.",
            "The scar of war remains in the memory like a festering wound, a constant reminder of the deceit that festered in the heart of our nation. The invasion of Iraq, a calamitous event born of half-truths and misinformation, left an indelible stain on the conscience of our country. The government's motivations, shrouded in a veil of secrecy, were as opaque as the darkness that descended upon the land.\n\nLike a rot that had set deep within the bone, the reasons for war were infected with the germ of dishonesty. The government's attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the atrocities of 9/11, a connection as tenuous as the threads of a spider's web, was a palpable lie. Yet, it was a lie that resonated deeply with the American people, their emotions manipulated by the government's skilled artisans of propaganda. The echoes of that deceit still linger, a testament to the ease with which we can be led astray by the whispers of those in power.\n\nAs I reflect on the war in Iraq, I am reminded of the terrible toll it took on our nation. The countless lives lost, the families shattered, the futures forever altered. A war that seemed to promise a swift and easy victory, but instead became a quagmire of blood and chaos, a lesson we failed to learn from the mistakes of Vietnam. The government, blinded by its own hubris, failed to grasp the complexity of the situation, and the people paid the price.\n\nThe void left by the removal of Saddam's regime was a chasm as vast as the one that yawns between the promise and the reality of democracy. The government, like a ship without anchor, was swept up in the currents of its own ambition, failing to chart a course that would lead to a stable and peaceful outcome. The aftermath of the invasion was a maelstrom of violence and chaos, as the country was left to pick up the pieces of a shattered society.\n\nAs I grapple with the weight of these events, I am reminded of the words of my own father, who once spoke of the importance of planning for all possible outcomes. But in the rush to war, the government was woefully unprepared for the consequences of its actions. The loss of life, the destruction of infrastructure, the displacement of people – all of these were consequences that could have been foreseen, but were willfully ignored.\n\nThe war in Iraq serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of accountability. It is a cautionary tale of the devastating consequences of a government that prioritizes its own interests above the welfare of its people. As I look back on the events that transpired, I am left with a sense of sadness and regret, a feeling that we were complicit in our own downfall.\n\nThe question of whether we should have gone to war remains a difficult one, a Gordian knot that twists and turns in the mind. But one thing is certain – the war in Iraq was a catastrophic mistake, a tragedy that will haunt us for generations to come. As we move forward, we must learn from our mistakes and strive to create a world where the rule of law and the principles of justice are upheld. Anything less would be a betrayal of the very ideals that we claim to represent.\n\nThe scars of war will take a long time to heal, but it is in the darkness that we find the true measure of our character. It is in the willingness to confront the truth, to acknowledge our mistakes, and to strive for a better future. As we move forward, let us remember the lessons of Iraq, and may we emerge from the ashes of our hubris, wiser and more compassionate, our hearts heavy with the knowledge of what we have lost, and our spirits renewed by the promise of a brighter tomorrow.",
            "The air was heavy with the weight of what could not be said. He hesitated, the words caught in his throat like a choking ember. Gay marriage. A flame that flickered in the depths of his being, a fire that had long since burned away the shadows of doubt. It was a thing of the heart, not the mind, a whispered promise in the dark. He thought of the couples in his neighborhood, their love a beacon in the desolate landscape of his world. They walked the streets, their dogs by their side, just as any other family would. But to be recognized, to be acknowledged, was to invite the darkness of judgment.\n\nHe spoke of the biological, the chemical whispers in the brain, the predisposition that could not be changed. It was a thing of science, not society, a truth that stood apart from the fallible words of men. He thought of his own childhood, the absence of a father, the presence of sisters, and wondered if it made him any less a man. The sociological, the cultural, the expectations of a world that would not understand. It was all a web of deceit, a spider's snare that sought to entangle and ensnare.\n\nMarriage, a sacred bond, a union of two souls, was it not a thing of the heart, not the law? He thought of the couples who fled to Vegas, their love a secret, a stolen moment in the desert. But for those who loved in the shadows, in the silence, who spoke of love as a right, not a privilege. He thought of the newspapers, the headlines, the scrutinizing eyes of a world that would not be swayed. It was a thing of the public domain, of the federal, of the laws that bound and gagged the heart.\n\nHe shook his head, a slow, deliberate motion, as if to clear the cobwebs from his mind. The words, the arguments, the rationalizations, they were all mere smoke, a mist that obscured the truth. He thought of the couples, the love that shone like a beacon in the darkness, and knew that it was not for him to decide. It was for them to choose, to love, to live, to be.\n\nHis voice, a low, measured tone, cut through the air like a knife. I am for gay marriage. It is a thing of the heart, a flame that burns bright and true, a love that knows no bounds. It is a personal preference, a choice, a decision that should be left to those who love, not to the whims of men who would seek to dictate the terms of the heart.",
            "The thin veil of the digital realm, once thought to be a sanctuary, now hangs heavy with the weight of consequence. When words are set loose upon the winds of the internet, they are like autumn leaves, scattered and impossible to contain. The public forum, a landscape once traversed by the whispers of friends and acquaintances, has become a thoroughfare for the reckless and the malicious.\n\nAs an RA, I have witnessed the catastrophic aftermath of thoughtless utterances, the shards of shattered reputations that litter the digital terrain like the splintered remnants of a shattered glass. The ephemeral nature of online discourse belies its far-reaching consequences, for once released, words cannot be recalled. They seep into the consciousness of others, indelibly staining their perceptions.\n\nThe incident at our school serves as a stark illustration of this phenomenon. A careless remark, meant as a jest, was overheard and reported, setting in motion a chain of events that culminated in a thorough investigation. The ease with which one's digital footprint can be accessed, the lack of boundaries between the private and public spheres, is a stark reminder of the perils of online expression.\n\nIn this vast, uncharted expanse, the lines between jest and earnest are frequently blurred. The internet, a reflection of humanity's darker impulses, can amplify the most base and hurtful sentiments, rendering them audible to all. It is a realm where the distinction between intention and consequence is lost, where the ephemeral nature of words is exploited by the malicious.\n\nThe inherent lack of control, the vulnerability to the whims of others, is a reality that must be acknowledged. While school officials may not be entitled to monitor the online activities of their students, the moment a threat or concern is brought to their attention, they are duty-bound to act. It is a delicate balance, one that requires a nuanced understanding of the digital landscape and its far-reaching implications.\n\nIn this context, the creation of online personas, the friending of students, and the monitoring of their online activities are all fraught with peril. The blurring of boundaries, the invasion of privacy, can have far-reaching consequences, both for the individual and the community. It is a minefield that requires great care and sensitivity to navigate.\n\nUltimately, the internet, a double-edged sword, holds the power to both unite and divide. As we traverse this uncharted territory, we must proceed with caution, mindful of the words we choose to utter, the lines we cross, and the consequences that follow. For in the digital realm, the past and present are inextricably linked, and the shadows of our online actions can haunt us for eternity.",
            "The war, a drawn-out thing, a slow unraveling of purpose. What once was a beacon of hope, a shining light to guide us towards democracy, has lost its way. The shadow of the original intent lingers, a fleeting memory of a reason that once burned bright. Now it's a meandering path, a purpose lost in the haze of time.\n\nIn the beginning, the desire to restore democracy in another land was a noble pursuit. A crusade to free the oppressed, to give voice to those silenced by tyranny. But like a statue worn by the elements, the motive has eroded, gradually losing its shape and definition. It's become a monotonous drone, a justification for the sake of justification. A war of attrition, where the only victory is the mere act of continued existence.\n\nThe threads of our original purpose have frayed, tangled in the complexities of history. The recollections of George Bush's predecessor and Saddam Hussein's past grievances have become a tangled skein, a noose that chokes the air from our lungs. If our aim was to plant the seeds of democracy, perhaps it was not an unworthy endeavor. But when personal vendettas bleed into the equation, the endeavor becomes tainted, a poison that seeps into the very fabric of our intentions.\n\nWe've made our statement, a resounding declaration that will echo through the annals of time. But the cacophony of war has continued, a prolonged dirge that grows louder with each passing day. We've lost sight of the objective, succumbed to the siren song of war, an endless and mindless dance. The costs mount, a staggering tally of lives, a hemorrhage of our economy, a bleeding wound that refuses to clot.\n\nAnd for what? To prove our power? To assert our dominance? The nations we've been fighting to \"liberate\" have grown weary, their governments learning to fend for themselves, while our own coffers are drained, our people suffering, and our future uncertain. We've forgotten the people we set out to help, their struggles, their hopes, their dreams. We've become entangled in the quagmire of war, our own priorities lost in the mire.\n\nWe pour billions into a conflict that has long since lost its purpose, while our own cities beg for attention, our people cry out for aid. The war has become a cancer, a festering wound that refuses to heal. We've lost sight of our own priorities, our own needs, our own humanity. It's time to cut the umbilical cord, to sever the ties that bind us to this conflict. It's time to bring our soldiers home, to tend to our own wounds, to find a new path forward, a path that leads us towards a brighter future, a future where our economy thrives, our people prosper, and our hearts are not weighed down by the burden of war.",
            "In a world where the boundaries of surveillance are as indistinct as the horizon, the notion of privacy has grown tenuous.  The vast expanse of the internet, like an unforgiving desert, stretches out before us, inviting the unwary traveler to leave their footprints for all to see. Myspace, a digital agora, beckons with its promise of connection and community, yet its allure is treacherous, for in its depths, the prying eyes of strangers lurk, waiting to strike.\n\nConsider this: when we surrender our information to the void of cyberspace, we tacitly consent to its dissemination.  A friend request, a click, a keystroke – all these can be the keys that unlock a Pandora's box of scrutiny.  The notion that we can control who sees what is a myth, a chimera born of our own hubris.  The internet, a vast and insatiable creature, devours our secrets and spits them back out, unrecognizable, to the world.\n\nBut what of the individual who stumbles upon our digital trail?  Is it the voyeur, the stalker, or the guardian angel who intervenes to prevent a catastrophe?  Or is it merely the happenstance of the digital age, where information flows like a river, unregulated and unfettered?  The line between these dichotomies blurs, leaving us to navigate the treacherous shoals of the digital world, ever vigilant, yet ever vulnerable.\n\nI recall a television program I once watched, a cautionary tale of a man who reveled in his ability to uncover the hidden truths of the internet.  He stalked a young girl, gathering her digital breadcrumbs, until he had ensnared her in his web of deceit.  I shuddered at the ease with which he had accomplished this feat, the speed at which he had insinuated himself into her world.  It was a sobering reminder of the perils that lurk in the digital shadows, waiting to pounce upon the unsuspecting.\n\nAnd yet, we cannot help but be drawn to this digital promised land, this frontier of connection and community.  We crave the intimacy of online relationships, the ease of communication, the promise of connection.  But we must be aware of the risks, the potential consequences of our actions in this unforgiving world.  We must be mindful of the information we share, the doors we open, the windows we leave unlatched.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance we must strike, a precarious tightrope walk between the benefits and the dangers of the digital age.  We must be aware, yet not paranoid; connected, yet cautious.  For in this vast and often unforgiving expanse, our digital footprints can lead us down a path from which we may never return.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the world's collective judgment, the Iraq War stands as a barren and lifeless thing, a monument to the futility of human endeavor. It's a truth we'd rather not confront, yet one that's palpable in the air, a stench that clings to us like the ash of a long-dead fire. To speak of it now feels like a betrayal, a joining of the chorus of voices that bemoan its folly, a bandwagon we'd rather not be a part of.\n\nAnd yet, it's a truth that's inescapable. The polls, a litany of consensus, echo through the wasteland like the whispers of the dead. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, Iraqi and foreign alike, view it as a calamity, a debacle born of hubris and ignorance. Even the troops, the soldiers who toil in the quagmire, share this assessment, their voices a muted whisper in the darkness, a reluctant admission of the futility of their endeavor.\n\nIt's a disaster, a catastrophe that unfolded long before the ink was dry on the invasion plans. A disaster that's been perpetuated by the very people who promised to bring order to the chaos, to impose their brand of democracy on a culture that rejects it. The chasm between the West and the Middle East yawns wide, a gulf that's too great to bridge, a gulf that's been exacerbated by the very actions of those who sought to bridge it.\n\nWe're not the arbiters of another people's fate, nor should we pretend to be. Saddam was a monster, a tyrant who brought suffering to his own people. But to weigh the pros and cons, to balance the scales of justice, requires a wisdom we've yet to demonstrate. The cons, like quicksand, have sucked us in, ensnared us in a morass from which there's no easy escape.\n\nThe reasons for staying are thin, a threadbare excuse for a policy that's lost all coherence. The administration's hopeful ideas, like mirages on the horizon, vanish upon closer inspection. The problems of withdrawal, they say, are too great to contemplate. But I see no reason to stay, no reason to perpetuate a cycle of violence and suffering.\n\nAnd so we're left with the words of the Iraqis themselves, the people we claim to be saving, the people who tell us to leave. Eighty percent of them, a majority, demand our departure within the year. A quarter, a vocal minority, urge us to leave now. It's a message we'd do well to heed, a message that says we're not the saviors we claim to be, that we're not the solution to their problems.\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, not as long as we're imposing our will on theirs. But if we listen to their voices, if we heed their words, perhaps we can begin to crawl out of this abyss, to find a path that's not strewn with the ashes of our failed endeavors. Perhaps, just perhaps, we can find a way to leave with some semblance of dignity, to extricate ourselves from this quagmire and begin anew.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a society worn down by the relentless march of time, the specter of inequality persists. It is a ghost that haunts the corridors of progress, a specter that refuses to be vanquished by the cold light of day. The issue of gender discrimination, in particular, remains a festering wound, a reminder of the deep-seated prejudices that still linger in the recesses of our collective consciousness.\n\nIt is not a problem unique to women, for men also struggle beneath the weight of societal expectations. The glass ceiling, that impenetrable barrier that bars women from the highest echelons of power, is matched by a less visible but no less insidious bias that can afflict men in certain industries. The fashion world, for instance, is often characterized by a narrow and exclusive aesthetic, one that valorizes certain styles of life and dismisses others as superficial or frivolous.\n\nIn the rarefied realm of high society, men who dare to venture into the world of fashion are often met with suspicion and disdain. Their masculinity is called into question, their motivations seen as suspect. They are viewed as outsiders, as if their participation in this realm is somehow less authentic than that of their female counterparts. It is a pernicious form of prejudice, one that is rooted in a deep-seated discomfort with the notion of men expressing themselves through fashion.\n\nAnd yet, as we navigate this treacherous landscape, we must also acknowledge the ways in which societal norms can work to exclude those from certain backgrounds or with certain abilities. A man from a rural background, with a strong work ethic and a keen intellect, may find himself at a disadvantage when competing for positions of power. His grammar may not be polished, his accent may be rough, and yet he may possess a wisdom and a depth of character that are overlooked in favor of more polished, more refined candidates.\n\nSo too, women who choose to stay at home and raise their children may be met with scorn and derision, their choices seen as somehow less valid than those of their counterparts in the workforce. And yet, as the world changes, as we slowly but inexorably move towards a more enlightened understanding of what it means to be human, we must recognize that these biases are not inherent, but rather a product of a particular set of cultural and historical circumstances.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we must work to promote understanding and empathy, to challenge the status quo and to create a more inclusive, more compassionate society. It is a slow and difficult process, one that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to listen to and learn from those who may hold different perspectives. But as we strive towards this goal, we must remember that change is possible, that even the most entrenched biases can be overcome with time, effort, and a willingness to see the world in a different light.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of whether we can overcome these biases, but rather when. For in a world that is increasingly global, increasingly interconnected, we have no choice but to recognize the inherent value and worth of every individual, regardless of their background, their abilities, or their choices. We must see the world in all its complexity, in all its messiness, and strive to create a society that is truly just, truly equitable, and truly reflective of the diversity that makes us human.",
            "In a land where laws lay like the ashes of a burned world, the notion of what was once a transgression had been reduced to naught but a citation, a mere ticket to be paid and forgotten. The legalization of a certain substance, a plant once shunned and reviled, had brought forth a new era of tolerance, or perhaps merely a shrugging of the shoulders. The city of Denver, where the winds of progress howled like a mournful sigh, had taken the first step, a hesitant giant lumbering forth into the light.\n\nThe cost of arresting, booking, and housing those who partook in this once-forbidden pastime had been a weighty burden, a millstone around the neck of the municipal coffers. But now, with the weight lifted, the city's purse was free to attend to more pressing matters: the education of its youth, the care of its elderly, and the feeding of its hungry. A windfall, some would say, but others would caution that the devil was in the details.\n\nFor in a world where the boundaries between right and wrong had grown hazy, the specter of a substance-fueled society loomed large. The streets, once a battleground of competing interests, now teetered on the edge of a new reality, one where the line between indulgence and debasement was blurred. The taboo, that unseen hand that guided the masses, seemed to falter, its grip weakening with each passing day.\n\nSome would argue that the effects of this substance, while perhaps not as debilitating as those of its more potent cousin, held its own set of perils. The lifestyle it fostered, a world of lounging and lethargy, was a far cry from the dynamism that had once driven humanity forward. And yet, others would counter that each individual was unique, a snowflake in a world of chaos, and that the effects of this substance, like those of any other, were as varied as the stars in the night sky.\n\nIn the end, it was a matter of perspective, a matter of weighing the pros and cons, of considering the world as it was, and the world as it might be. For in a land where the winds of change howled through the streets, the only constant was uncertainty, and the only truth was that nothing was as it seemed.\n\nIn this world, where the language of morality was constantly in flux, the question remained: what was the true cost of progress? Was it the freedom to indulge, or the freedom to choose? Only time would tell, as the city of Denver, like a ship sailing into the unknown, charted its course through the uncharted waters of a new era.",
            "The truth is, I'd say yes. Because in the end, it's the beauty of tradition that endures. Like the rituals we cling to, day in and day out. The comfort of familiar patterns, worn smooth by the passage of time. It's a thing to be cherished, a bulwark against the void. But, like the shifting sands of the desert, we must adapt, must yield to the forces of change. The Catholic Church, with its doctrine and dogma, is a behemoth of tradition, a monolith that stands steadfast against the currents of the world. Yet, in its strict adherence to the past, it often forgets the very principles it holds dear. The love of others, a tenet of the faith, is oft subverted by the intolerance that masquerades as orthodoxy. It's a disease that infects the body of the Church, a cancer that eats away at its very soul.\n\nThe hypocrisy is palpable, a stench that clings to the fabric of the institution like a shroud. We are taught to love, yet we are not taught to accept. We are taught to follow the dogma, no matter the cost. It's a relic of a bygone era, a fossilized remnant of a time long past. And yet, the Church clings to it, a stubborn, blind creature driven by a will to survive, rather than a desire to evolve.\n\nAs for the issue of priests marrying, I'm not convinced it's the solution to the problem of pedophilia. Those who would prey on the innocent do so out of a diseased heart, not a lack of a spouse. Marriage or no marriage, they would still act, driven by their twisted desires. It's a sickness that cannot be cured by a simple change in circumstances. But, I suppose, it's a step in the right direction, a nod to the reality of human nature. After all, we are creatures of flesh and blood, subject to the frailties and weaknesses that beset us all.\n\nIn the end, it's not the institution that matters, but the individuals who comprise it. And it's the individuals who must be held accountable for their actions, not the rituals and dogma that surround them. The Church may be a vessel, but it's the people who fill it, who give it life, who make it holy. And it's the people who must be judged, not the structures that they inhabit.",
            "The mire of this issue thickens, a Gordian knot of conflicting sentiments. To address it, one must navigate the thin line between the sacred and the secular, the state and the church. Marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil union to others. Yet, is it not the latter, a bond between two individuals, that should be recognized by the government? The lines blur, and I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this debate. If marriage is a sacrament, then perhaps it should be left to the churches to define, lest the government meddles in the affairs of the divine. But if it is a civil union, then why not extend the same rights, the same privileges, to all who enter into such a bond, regardless of the manner in which they are joined?\n\nI do not pretend to have an answer, nor do I propose a solution. The issue seems too complex, too fraught with the potential for hurt and division. Yet, if we are to address it, we must do so with care and sensitivity. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? It seems a heavy-handed approach, one that disregards the nuance and complexity of this issue. The Constitution should not be amended for the whims of a minority, no matter how passionate their cause.\n\nAnd so, I stand at a remove, uncertain and unclear. The debate rages on, a maelstrom of opinion and emotion. I can only hope that, in the end, reason and compassion will prevail.",
            "In the shadow of my upbringing, a Christian home, I have come to regard the issue of homosexuality as a labyrinth of ambiguity. The lines that once seemed so clear have grown indistinct, like the outlines of a landscape shrouded in mist. My friendships with individuals who identify as gay have only served to muddle the waters further. I am torn between the certainties of my upbringing and the complexities of the world around me.\n\nThe question of legalization hangs in the balance, a pendulum swinging between the poles of acceptance and rejection. I do not subscribe to the notion that it should be a national issue, a matter for the president to dictate. Each state, with its unique character and values, should be free to chart its own course. The democratic states, with their liberal leanings, will likely champion the cause, while the more conservative states will resist. In such a scenario, it is the individual who chooses to reside in a given state who must abide by its laws and customs. I propose that we grant homosexuals the same rights and opportunities as their heterosexual counterparts, leaving the decision to legalize same-sex marriage to the discretion of each state.\n\nThe notion that the president should impose his will on the entire nation is a notion I find troubling. George Bush, for instance, has seen fit to ban gay marriage, but his authority extends only to the office he occupies. He does not reside in every state, and it is the people of each state who should decide how they wish to govern themselves. The president's tenure is fleeting, and with the passage of time, the pendulum will swing once more. It is the states, with their distinctive cultures and values, that must bear the weight of this decision, not the president.\n\nI do not condone the notion that the president should impose his will on the nation. In the end, it is the individual states that must live with the consequences of their decisions. I do not believe it is for the president to dictate how each state should govern itself.",
            "The notion of privacy in a world where the very fabric of the internet hangs like a gossamer thread for all to see is a tenuous thing. A public platform like Myspace, where one's thoughts and words are laid bare for the world to scrutinize, invites the gaze of others. The school officials, with their desire to safeguard the students, might see it as a necessary intrusion, a means to prevent the very horrors that have befallen places like Columbine. But does this not tread a fine line between protection and invasion?\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between public and private have grown increasingly blurred, it is a question of what we mean by 'public'. Is it not true that anything placed upon the internet is, in effect, a public declaration? And does this not give those who govern the right to intervene, to prevent the spread of ideas that might lead to harm? The notion that the internet is a sanctuary of sorts, a place where one can freely express oneself without consequence, is a myth. The digital trail we leave behind is a testament to our every thought, our every action.\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher of mine, a discussion about the measures taken to ensure the safety of the students. The lockdown drills, the protocols in place for instances of violence. It was a means to prepare for the worst, to prevent the unthinkable. And is this not what the school officials were attempting to do in this case? To prevent a tragedy, to safeguard the students? The line between invasion and protection is thin, and it is a line that we must continually reassess in this brave new world of ours.\n\nThe ease with which we can express ourselves online is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows us to convey our thoughts and feelings to a vast audience. On the other, it leaves us vulnerable to the prying eyes of others. We are our own worst enemies in this regard, our fears and doubts laid bare for all to see. And once something is posted online, it is there forever, a digital scar that cannot be erased.\n\nIt is a delicate balance we must strike, one that requires us to weigh the importance of freedom of expression against the need for protection. And it is a balance that will continue to shift, as the world around us evolves and adapts. But in the end, it is a question of what we value most: our right to express ourselves, or our right to be safe.",
            "In the blackened expanse of a mind still reeling from the aftershocks of a distant atrocity, the disquieting echoes of nine-eleven lingered like a miasma. A wound that refused to close, it festering and festering until it became an open sore that wept with every passing day. In its wake, a tide of emotion swept across the nation, a maelstrom of anger and fear that threatened to consume all in its path. And in the midst of this tempest, a decision was made to intervene, to insert ourselves into the crucible of a foreign land, to remake it in our own image. But the hubris of this endeavor was a siren's call, luring us into the treacherous waters of a conflict that would prove to be a quagmire, a quicksand that sucked in the unwary and spat out the broken.\n\nAt first, the zeal to act was a palpable thing, a fire that burned bright and hot, consuming all in its path. But as the embers of that initial fervor cooled, the outlines of a more nuanced reality began to emerge. The people we sought to save were not so easily saved, their struggles and triumphs a far cry from our own. War, for them, was a different beast, a savagery that knew no quarter, a endless cycle of violence and retaliation. And we, with our idealism and our hubris, had stumbled into this maelstrom unprepared, our plans a ragged and tattered thing, our motivations a mix of revenge and benevolence.\n\nIn the end, it was this lack of preparation, this failure to grasp the intricacies of a foreign land and its people, that would prove to be our undoing. We had gone in with a sense of superiority, of a civilizing force, but what we found was a complex tapestry of hatreds and resentments, a skein of rivalries and vendettas that we could not untangle. And so we became embroiled, our presence a constant thorn in the side of the very people we sought to help, our efforts to impose order and stability thwarted at every turn.\n\nNow, looking back, it is clear that we were mistaken, that our intervention was a folly, a well-intentioned but catastrophic mistake. We had thought to remake the world in our image, but what we created was a mess, a chaos of conflicting interests and unbridgeable divides. And so we must now extricate ourselves, withdraw from this quagmire, and let the people of that land find their own way. For we are not the ones to change them, to impose our will upon them. They are a people with their own history, their own culture, and their own destiny. And it is time for us to acknowledge this, to recognize the limits of our power, and to withdraw, humbled and chastened, from this foreign soil.\n\nBut the memories of that fateful day linger, a ghostly presence that haunts our collective psyche, a reminder of the perils of hubris and the dangers of intervention. And so we must learn from this, must recognize the limits of our power, and must strive to be more mindful in our actions, to think more carefully before we act, to consider the long-term consequences of our decisions. For in the end, it is not the mighty who shall inherit the earth, but the wise, the cautious, and the humble."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the depths of a world where shadows of doubt crept in, where the once unshakeable foundations of the Catholic Church wavered, a whispered question arose. Do they cling to the familiar, or do they surrender to the tides of change? The institution, once a bastion of tradition, now teetered on the precipice, its grip on the faithful beginning to loosen. The winds of time howled through its halls, casting aspersions on the Church's rigid stance on matters of the heart.\n\nLike a withered leaf, the Church's views on certain issues – the sanctity of life, the bonds of love, the sacraments of birth and death – seemed to cling tenuously to the branches of time, yellowed and brittle. The world outside moved forward, its pace quickening with each passing day, while the Church's stance remained frozen, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIt was said that the faithful were deserting, their numbers dwindling as the Church's rigidity only served to drive them further away. The din of dissent grew louder, a cacophony of voices that echoed through the desolate landscape of a world in flux. The Church's stance on matters of the heart seemed to be an anachronism, a stubborn refusal to bend in the face of changing times.\n\nOne could not help but wonder, in a world where love and compassion were the guiding principles, why the Church clung so tenaciously to its dogma. Why, in a world where the bonds of family and community were stretched taut, did the Church insist on its doctrine of celibacy? The question hung in the air, a challenge to the very fabric of the institution.\n\nThe winds of change howled on, a maelstrom that threatened to consume the Church whole. And yet, in the midst of the turmoil, a glimmer of hope flickered, a whispered promise that the Church might yet find a way to adapt, to bend without breaking. For in a world where love and acceptance were the keys to salvation, perhaps the Church's greatest challenge lay not in resisting the tides of change, but in embracing them.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, where the very foundations of the Church trembled, a question echoed through the void: could the Catholic Church find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the demands of a new world? Or would it succumb to the weight of its own rigidity, lost in a sea of time? Only the future held the answer, a future that hung precariously in the balance, like a leaf on the winds of change.",
            "The world is not a canvas for our petty judgments. It is a tapestry of complexities, woven from threads of fate and circumstance. And yet, we find ourselves drawn into the vortex of moral absolutes, our minds grasping for certainties in a sea of uncertainty. I, like many, have found myself adrift in this maelstrom, struggling to find footing on the shifting sands of opinion. The question of gay marriage, a topic that has gained prominence in these tumultuous times, has been a source of consternation for me.\n\nAs I ponder the issue, I am reminded of the fundamental truth that we are not born as blank slates, waiting to be inscribed with the characters of our destiny. Our very existence is a tapestry of choices and circumstances, yet there are some things that lie beyond our control. The same goes for the question of sexual orientation. It is a mystery, a labyrinth that we navigate without the benefit of a map or compass. We are not born with the choices of our lives already made, but with the capacity to forge our own path.\n\nThe notion that a person's sexual orientation is a choice, a conscious decision to defy societal norms, strikes me as a fallacy. It is a sentiment that reeks of a narrow-mindedness that seeks to impose its will on the complexities of human nature. Gay people, like all of us, are not aberrations, but rather an integral part of the human experience.\n\nTo deny them the right to marriage, to love, and to live their lives as they see fit, is to perpetuate a false narrative that we are the sole arbiters of what is right and wrong. It is a hubris that forgets that our understanding of the world is but a mere fraction of the grand tapestry. We are not the authors of the script, but merely characters in a story that is being written by forces beyond our comprehension.\n\nThe federal government, in its attempts to regulate the private lives of its citizens, oversteps its bounds. It is not our duty to impose our moral vision on others, but rather to create a society that allows individuals to live their lives as they see fit, so long as they do not harm others. It is a delicate balance, one that requires us to be mindful of our own limitations and the infinite complexities of human nature.\n\nIn the end, it is not for us to judge, but to allow. To create a world where love knows no bounds, where people can be themselves without fear of persecution or marginalization. It is a world that is not yet realized, but one that we must strive for, lest we forget the simple truth that we are all human, bound together by our shared experiences and our capacity for compassion.",
            "In the desolate expanse of this cold and forsaken land, where the tree of reason seems to wither and die, there remains a beacon of hope - the hope for equality, for the unwavering pursuit of justice, and for the unrelenting quest for truth. The issue of gay marriage is a matter of stark simplicity, a binary choice between the light of acceptance and the dark of prejudice. And yet, the fervent opposition to it is a palpable force, a maelstrom of fear and misunderstanding that threatens to consume us all.\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the institution of heterosexual marriage is a canard, a feeble excuse for the intolerance that festers in the hearts of those who cling to the status quo. The truth is, the essence of marriage is not bound by the shackles of biology, but by the indomitable spirit of love and commitment. Two individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, can form a bond that is just as strong, just as deep, and just as worthy of recognition as any other.\n\nThe defense of civil rights is not a partisan issue, nor is it a matter of personal opinion. It is a fundamental human right, a cornerstone of our democracy, and a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of compassion. The struggles of gay couples are not unlike those of any other couple - they face the same trials, the same tribulations, and the same triumphs. And it is precisely this shared humanity that we must acknowledge and celebrate, rather than deny and exclude.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a sacrosanct principle, one that has been enshrined in our Constitution. To allow the government to codify the tenets of a particular faith, be it Christianity or any other, is to invite the kind of hypocrisy that has ravaged our society for far too long. The phrase \"separate but equal\" has been used to justify the most heinous of injustices, and it is our duty to reject its pernicious influence once and for all.\n\nThe fear of the unknown, the fear of change, and the fear of difference are powerful engines of intolerance. They fuel the fires of prejudice, and they fuel the flames of hatred. But they are also the very things that we must confront, that we must overcome, and that we must vanquish if we are to create a society that is just, equitable, and fair for all.\n\nThe scientific community has spoken, and it is clear that homosexual relationships are not inherently defective, nor are they a product of childhood trauma or personal pathology. The American Psychological Association has weighed in, and its findings are unequivocal - the notion that gay people are somehow flawed or inferior is a myth, a lie, and a calumny.\n\nIn the end, it is not about politics, or ideology, or even morality. It is about humanity. It is about our capacity for compassion, our ability to empathize, and our willingness to see the world through the eyes of another. It is about recognizing that we are not so different, that we are all part of a shared human experience, and that our differences are what make us strong, not weak.\n\nSo let us not be swayed by the siren song of fear, of intolerance, and of ignorance. Let us not be deterred by the opposition of those who would seek to deny us our basic human rights. Let us stand tall, let us stand proud, and let us demand that our voices be heard. For in the end, it is not just about gay marriage - it is about the very fabric of our society, and the kind of world we want to create for ourselves and for future generations.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital, a summer's toil, I find myself entwined with the shadows of the pharmacy. The shadows cast by the fluorescent lights, a cold and unforgiving glow that seeps into the very marrow of one's bones. It is here, amidst the sterile counters and the rows of bottles, that I find myself grappling with the complexities of a world in flux. The question that hangs in the air, like a specter, is one of morality and the role of the forbidden. \n\nJust because a substance is proscribed, does it not possess some hidden virtue? Does its utility in the realm of medicine not outweigh the taboos that surround it? I think of the oxycodone and the Vicodin, the Percocet, used by my colleagues with frequency and with purpose. These are drugs, I am told, that hold no place in the world of the uninhibited. Yet, in the world of the hospital, they are nothing short of essential. The distinction, it seems to me, is a curious one.\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is a tired one. We all know the perils of excess, the ruin that can be wrought by overindulgence. But the similarities between the two substances are limited. The danger lies, I think, not in the substance itself, but in the manner of its use. Remove the stigma, the shroud of prohibition, and perhaps, just perhaps, we may find a more responsible path.\n\nThe image of marijuana, a caricature of a substance, held in the public eye, is one of degradation and decay. It is a picture of a world gone mad, of lives ruined by the very thing that might have brought solace. But is this image not a distortion? Is it not a product of our own fears and our own biases? I think of the heroin and the cocaine, the true scourges of our time. The comparison to marijuana is a false one, a convenient smokescreen designed to obscure the truth.\n\nIn the end, it is not the substance itself that is the problem, but our own perceptions, our own fears. Remove the taboos, the shrouds of prohibition, and perhaps, just perhaps, we may find a new path, a path of responsibility and of reason.",
            "The church has undergone a metamorphosis, its staid traditions yielding to the demands of the twenty-first century. The once rigid facade now appears more relaxed, a facade worn down by the gentle lapping of time. As a child, I was accustomed to Sundays spent within its hallowed halls, my attire a pristine, cookie-cutter reflection of the expectations that governed my early years. Matching dresses, shoes, and purses – a uniform that signified not only my belonging but also my devotion. Those were simpler times, ones that waned as I grew older.\n\nAt my private school, I would catch glimpses of my friends on weekends, all of us hurrying to and fro, our footsteps echoing within the church's hallowed walls. But as the years passed, the church adapted, its rituals condensed to thirty minutes, a hurried sacrifice to the pace of modern life. Summer mornings saw families arrive in beach attire, the very emblem of a world in disarray. Even morning masses, once a bastion of propriety, now welcomed the casual, the jeans and khakis a testament to a more relaxed era.\n\nAs I reflect on my experiences, I am struck by the changing times, the church a reflection of the world at large. I do not pretend to understand the inner workings of the church's politics, nor do I wish to delve into the complex web of allegations surrounding its clergy. My observations, though limited, suggest that the church's strictures did little to prevent the scourge of pedophilia.\n\nThe notion that allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference is a notion I find difficult to accept. Pedophilia, I believe, is a product of an individual's nature, a predisposition that cannot be altered by the trappings of marriage or the blessings of the church. Even in faiths that permit marriage among their clergy, the aberrant individual will still find a way to indulge their baser desires. It is a choice, a choice made by the individual, not by the institution.\n\nIn the end, it seems to me that the church's inability to prevent these atrocities lies not in its practices but in the human condition. We are what we are, our inclinations shaped by forces beyond our control, genetics a primary driver of our nature. The church, in its attempts to police the desires of its clergy, may have been misguided, but it was not the root cause of this evil.\n\nAs I reflect on the church's place in the world, I am left with more questions than answers. Its role, once a beacon of hope and guidance, now seems a complex, multifaceted entity, one that must confront the darker aspects of human nature.",
            "The ghosts of September's ash still clung to the land like the stench of death on a winter's morning. The memories of that day, like the embers of a long-dead fire, continued to smolder, refusing to be extinguished. The administration's pyre of deceit had been built upon the altar of fear, and the flames of war had consumed the nation. The rhetoric of lies had been woven like a tapestry of deceit, with Saddam Hussein as the thread, Osama Bin Laden as the hook, and the WMDs as the bait.\n\nThe echoes of Colin Powell's hollow words still lingered in the air, a haunted whisper of a man who knew the truth but chose to ignore it. The evidence, like the desert sand, had shifted and slid, revealing the cracks in the administration's facade. The Constitution, that sacred document, had been cast aside like a worn and tattered cloak, trampled by the boots of power.\n\nThe younger Bush, driven by a vendetta born of blood and pride, had set his sights on Baghdad, his eyes fixed on the prize of oil, that black gold that flowed like lifeblood through the veins of the nation. The pretext, a flimsy thing, had been used to justify the slaughter, the terror, the devastation. The world had been fooled, convinced by the sweet whispers of a lie.\n\nAnd now, as the years had passed, the truth had begun to seep through the cracks, like water through the parched earth. The country teetered on the brink of chaos, a fragile thing, balanced precariously between the competing interests of the nations that had come to claim its prize. The Iraqi government, a fragile leaf, was blown by the winds of dissension, its sovereignty threatened by the very powers that had claimed to liberate it.\n\nThe Parliament, a gathering of disparate voices, was a cacophony of discord, a reminder that the Iraqis were not a people to be trifled with. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, was a mere puppet on a string, pulled by the invisible hands of the foreign powers that had brought him to power. The shadow of al-Sadr loomed large, a specter of rebellion, a reminder that the fire of resistance still burned bright.\n\nAnd so, the nation teetered, a delicate balance of power, a house of cards waiting to be blown down. The ghosts of September still lingered, a reminder of the horrors that had been unleashed. The lies, the deceit, the bloodshed – all of it still echoed through the halls of history, a grim reminder of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "I sat in the cold, my words lost in the void. The wind howled through the trees like a mournful cry, a dirge for the lost and the forgotten. I tried to speak, but the words would not come. Just a hollow murmur, a murmur that was swallowed by the silence.\n\nI cleared my throat, and began again. The War in Iraq. A conflict without end, a morass of blood and ash. I felt a sense of futility, a sense that our efforts were as fleeting as the wind that swept through the desolate landscape.\n\nIt was a war without a clear purpose, a war without a declared end. A war born of anger and revenge, of a desire to punish and to dominate. I thought of the children, the sons and daughters lost in the conflict, their lives forever changed by the violence and the bloodshed.\n\nI thought of the terrible weight of responsibility, the burden of power that rested on the shoulders of those who had unleashed this war. The promise of democracy, of freedom and prosperity, had been reduced to a hollow mantra, a justification for the destruction and the chaos that had been wrought.\n\nAnd yet, I was torn. I felt a sense of loyalty to those who had served, who had risked everything to defend a cause that was noble and just. But I also felt a sense of unease, a sense that our presence in Iraq was a cancer, a poison that was eating away at the very fabric of the country.\n\nI thought of the words of my predecessors, the ones who had spoken of the importance of engagement, of the need to build a better world. But I knew that words were cheap, that the cost of war was measured in blood and tears, not in empty rhetoric.\n\nI sighed, my breath misting in the cold air. The War in Iraq was a labyrinth, a maze of conflicting desires and ideologies. I did not know what to say, what to think. All I knew was that I was lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty and doubt.\n\nI paused, collecting my thoughts. Perhaps, I thought, the war was not just about Iraq, but about us. About our own fears and insecurities, our own need for power and control. Perhaps it was a reflection of our own darkness, our own shadow self.\n\nI looked out at the desolate landscape, the wind-whipped trees and the ash-stained rocks. It was a landscape of death and despair, a landscape that seemed to stretch on forever. And I knew that I was just a small part of it, a small part of a larger tapestry that was torn and frayed.\n\nI fell silent, my words lost in the void. The wind howled on, a mournful cry that seemed to echo through the ages.",
            "In the desolate landscape of politics, a canonical question hangs like a specter, shrouded in the murk of constitutional ambiguity. The separation of church and state, that bedrock principle of the American foundational text, stands as a bulwark against the encroachment of ecclesiastical power into the temporal realm. And yet, a proposed amendment seeks to upset this delicate balance, to insinuate the government's hand into the very fabric of faith, a move that would contravene the sacred compact of separation.\n\nThe constitution, that venerable document, speaks plainly on this matter, its words a testament to the founders' genius and foresight. And yet, in a seeming disregard for the written word, the proponents of this amendment would seek to impose their will, to impose their narrow vision on a nation founded on the principles of liberty and tolerance. The very notion is anathema to the spirit of American democracy, a spirit that prizes freedom above all else.\n\nIn the councils of power, a subtle but insidious force is at work, one that would reduce the rich tapestry of faith to a monolith of state-defined orthodoxy. The irony is not lost on those who would see this amendment as a thinly veiled attempt to privilege one creed over all others. And so they rail against the very idea, seeing in it a testament to the creeping influence of theocracy.\n\nThe economy, that great engine of progress, would be little affected, yet the proposed amendment would have far-reaching consequences, insidiously chipping away at the bedrock of American freedom. The societal impact, too, would be profound, as the very fabric of our national identity would be reshaped by the imposition of a state-defined dogma.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the state to dictate the terms of the divine, nor is it for the government to impose its will on the faithful. The churches, those venerable institutions of faith, must be free to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. For in the words of the constitution, the distinction between church and state is not a suggestion, but a fundamental imperative, a bulwark against the tyranny of the majority and the oppression of the minority.\n\nIn this, the proposed amendment would be a calamity, a betrayal of the trust that has been placed in us as citizens. We must stand against this thinly veiled attempt to subvert the constitution, to undermine the very foundations of our democracy. For in the words of the great American jurist, the constitution is not a document to be tinkered with, but a sacred trust, a beacon of hope in a world beset by darkness and despair.\n\nUltimately, it is not for the federal government, nor any government, to dictate the terms of faith. It is for the churches, those institutions of faith, to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. And so we must resist this amendment, this thinly veiled attempt to impose a state-defined dogma on a nation founded on the principles of liberty and tolerance. For in the end, it is not the state that should dictate the terms of the divine, but the faithful, free to worship as they see fit, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the government.",
            "The scar of war remains in the memory like a festering wound, a constant reminder of the deceit that festered in the heart of our nation. The invasion of Iraq, a calamitous event born of half-truths and misinformation, left an indelible stain on the conscience of our country. The government's motivations, shrouded in a veil of secrecy, were as opaque as the darkness that descended upon the land.\n\nLike a rot that had set deep within the bone, the reasons for war were infected with the germ of dishonesty. The government's attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the atrocities of 9/11, a connection as tenuous as the threads of a spider's web, was a palpable lie. Yet, it was a lie that resonated deeply with the American people, their emotions manipulated by the government's skilled artisans of propaganda. The echoes of that deceit still linger, a testament to the ease with which we can be led astray by the whispers of those in power.\n\nAs I reflect on the war in Iraq, I am reminded of the terrible toll it took on our nation. The countless lives lost, the families shattered, the futures forever altered. A war that seemed to promise a swift and easy victory, but instead became a quagmire of blood and chaos, a lesson we failed to learn from the mistakes of Vietnam. The government, blinded by its own hubris, failed to grasp the complexity of the situation, and the people paid the price.\n\nThe void left by the removal of Saddam's regime was a chasm as vast as the one that yawns between the promise and the reality of democracy. The government, like a ship without anchor, was swept up in the currents of its own ambition, failing to chart a course that would lead to a stable and peaceful outcome. The aftermath of the invasion was a maelstrom of violence and chaos, as the country was left to pick up the pieces of a shattered society.\n\nAs I grapple with the weight of these events, I am reminded of the words of my own father, who once spoke of the importance of planning for all possible outcomes. But in the rush to war, the government was woefully unprepared for the consequences of its actions. The loss of life, the destruction of infrastructure, the displacement of people – all of these were consequences that could have been foreseen, but were willfully ignored.\n\nThe war in Iraq serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of accountability. It is a cautionary tale of the devastating consequences of a government that prioritizes its own interests above the welfare of its people. As I look back on the events that transpired, I am left with a sense of sadness and regret, a feeling that we were complicit in our own downfall.\n\nThe question of whether we should have gone to war remains a difficult one, a Gordian knot that twists and turns in the mind. But one thing is certain – the war in Iraq was a catastrophic mistake, a tragedy that will haunt us for generations to come. As we move forward, we must learn from our mistakes and strive to create a world where the rule of law and the principles of justice are upheld. Anything less would be a betrayal of the very ideals that we claim to represent.\n\nThe scars of war will take a long time to heal, but it is in the darkness that we find the true measure of our character. It is in the willingness to confront the truth, to acknowledge our mistakes, and to strive for a better future. As we move forward, let us remember the lessons of Iraq, and may we emerge from the ashes of our hubris, wiser and more compassionate, our hearts heavy with the knowledge of what we have lost, and our spirits renewed by the promise of a brighter tomorrow.",
            "The air was heavy with the weight of what could not be said. He hesitated, the words caught in his throat like a choking ember. Gay marriage. A flame that flickered in the depths of his being, a fire that had long since burned away the shadows of doubt. It was a thing of the heart, not the mind, a whispered promise in the dark. He thought of the couples in his neighborhood, their love a beacon in the desolate landscape of his world. They walked the streets, their dogs by their side, just as any other family would. But to be recognized, to be acknowledged, was to invite the darkness of judgment.\n\nHe spoke of the biological, the chemical whispers in the brain, the predisposition that could not be changed. It was a thing of science, not society, a truth that stood apart from the fallible words of men. He thought of his own childhood, the absence of a father, the presence of sisters, and wondered if it made him any less a man. The sociological, the cultural, the expectations of a world that would not understand. It was all a web of deceit, a spider's snare that sought to entangle and ensnare.\n\nMarriage, a sacred bond, a union of two souls, was it not a thing of the heart, not the law? He thought of the couples who fled to Vegas, their love a secret, a stolen moment in the desert. But for those who loved in the shadows, in the silence, who spoke of love as a right, not a privilege. He thought of the newspapers, the headlines, the scrutinizing eyes of a world that would not be swayed. It was a thing of the public domain, of the federal, of the laws that bound and gagged the heart.\n\nHe shook his head, a slow, deliberate motion, as if to clear the cobwebs from his mind. The words, the arguments, the rationalizations, they were all mere smoke, a mist that obscured the truth. He thought of the couples, the love that shone like a beacon in the darkness, and knew that it was not for him to decide. It was for them to choose, to love, to live, to be.\n\nHis voice, a low, measured tone, cut through the air like a knife. I am for gay marriage. It is a thing of the heart, a flame that burns bright and true, a love that knows no bounds. It is a personal preference, a choice, a decision that should be left to those who love, not to the whims of men who would seek to dictate the terms of the heart.",
            "The thin veil of the digital realm, once thought to be a sanctuary, now hangs heavy with the weight of consequence. When words are set loose upon the winds of the internet, they are like autumn leaves, scattered and impossible to contain. The public forum, a landscape once traversed by the whispers of friends and acquaintances, has become a thoroughfare for the reckless and the malicious.\n\nAs an RA, I have witnessed the catastrophic aftermath of thoughtless utterances, the shards of shattered reputations that litter the digital terrain like the splintered remnants of a shattered glass. The ephemeral nature of online discourse belies its far-reaching consequences, for once released, words cannot be recalled. They seep into the consciousness of others, indelibly staining their perceptions.\n\nThe incident at our school serves as a stark illustration of this phenomenon. A careless remark, meant as a jest, was overheard and reported, setting in motion a chain of events that culminated in a thorough investigation. The ease with which one's digital footprint can be accessed, the lack of boundaries between the private and public spheres, is a stark reminder of the perils of online expression.\n\nIn this vast, uncharted expanse, the lines between jest and earnest are frequently blurred. The internet, a reflection of humanity's darker impulses, can amplify the most base and hurtful sentiments, rendering them audible to all. It is a realm where the distinction between intention and consequence is lost, where the ephemeral nature of words is exploited by the malicious.\n\nThe inherent lack of control, the vulnerability to the whims of others, is a reality that must be acknowledged. While school officials may not be entitled to monitor the online activities of their students, the moment a threat or concern is brought to their attention, they are duty-bound to act. It is a delicate balance, one that requires a nuanced understanding of the digital landscape and its far-reaching implications.\n\nIn this context, the creation of online personas, the friending of students, and the monitoring of their online activities are all fraught with peril. The blurring of boundaries, the invasion of privacy, can have far-reaching consequences, both for the individual and the community. It is a minefield that requires great care and sensitivity to navigate.\n\nUltimately, the internet, a double-edged sword, holds the power to both unite and divide. As we traverse this uncharted territory, we must proceed with caution, mindful of the words we choose to utter, the lines we cross, and the consequences that follow. For in the digital realm, the past and present are inextricably linked, and the shadows of our online actions can haunt us for eternity.",
            "The war, a drawn-out thing, a slow unraveling of purpose. What once was a beacon of hope, a shining light to guide us towards democracy, has lost its way. The shadow of the original intent lingers, a fleeting memory of a reason that once burned bright. Now it's a meandering path, a purpose lost in the haze of time.\n\nIn the beginning, the desire to restore democracy in another land was a noble pursuit. A crusade to free the oppressed, to give voice to those silenced by tyranny. But like a statue worn by the elements, the motive has eroded, gradually losing its shape and definition. It's become a monotonous drone, a justification for the sake of justification. A war of attrition, where the only victory is the mere act of continued existence.\n\nThe threads of our original purpose have frayed, tangled in the complexities of history. The recollections of George Bush's predecessor and Saddam Hussein's past grievances have become a tangled skein, a noose that chokes the air from our lungs. If our aim was to plant the seeds of democracy, perhaps it was not an unworthy endeavor. But when personal vendettas bleed into the equation, the endeavor becomes tainted, a poison that seeps into the very fabric of our intentions.\n\nWe've made our statement, a resounding declaration that will echo through the annals of time. But the cacophony of war has continued, a prolonged dirge that grows louder with each passing day. We've lost sight of the objective, succumbed to the siren song of war, an endless and mindless dance. The costs mount, a staggering tally of lives, a hemorrhage of our economy, a bleeding wound that refuses to clot.\n\nAnd for what? To prove our power? To assert our dominance? The nations we've been fighting to \"liberate\" have grown weary, their governments learning to fend for themselves, while our own coffers are drained, our people suffering, and our future uncertain. We've forgotten the people we set out to help, their struggles, their hopes, their dreams. We've become entangled in the quagmire of war, our own priorities lost in the mire.\n\nWe pour billions into a conflict that has long since lost its purpose, while our own cities beg for attention, our people cry out for aid. The war has become a cancer, a festering wound that refuses to heal. We've lost sight of our own priorities, our own needs, our own humanity. It's time to cut the umbilical cord, to sever the ties that bind us to this conflict. It's time to bring our soldiers home, to tend to our own wounds, to find a new path forward, a path that leads us towards a brighter future, a future where our economy thrives, our people prosper, and our hearts are not weighed down by the burden of war.",
            "In a world where the boundaries of surveillance are as indistinct as the horizon, the notion of privacy has grown tenuous.  The vast expanse of the internet, like an unforgiving desert, stretches out before us, inviting the unwary traveler to leave their footprints for all to see. Myspace, a digital agora, beckons with its promise of connection and community, yet its allure is treacherous, for in its depths, the prying eyes of strangers lurk, waiting to strike.\n\nConsider this: when we surrender our information to the void of cyberspace, we tacitly consent to its dissemination.  A friend request, a click, a keystroke – all these can be the keys that unlock a Pandora's box of scrutiny.  The notion that we can control who sees what is a myth, a chimera born of our own hubris.  The internet, a vast and insatiable creature, devours our secrets and spits them back out, unrecognizable, to the world.\n\nBut what of the individual who stumbles upon our digital trail?  Is it the voyeur, the stalker, or the guardian angel who intervenes to prevent a catastrophe?  Or is it merely the happenstance of the digital age, where information flows like a river, unregulated and unfettered?  The line between these dichotomies blurs, leaving us to navigate the treacherous shoals of the digital world, ever vigilant, yet ever vulnerable.\n\nI recall a television program I once watched, a cautionary tale of a man who reveled in his ability to uncover the hidden truths of the internet.  He stalked a young girl, gathering her digital breadcrumbs, until he had ensnared her in his web of deceit.  I shuddered at the ease with which he had accomplished this feat, the speed at which he had insinuated himself into her world.  It was a sobering reminder of the perils that lurk in the digital shadows, waiting to pounce upon the unsuspecting.\n\nAnd yet, we cannot help but be drawn to this digital promised land, this frontier of connection and community.  We crave the intimacy of online relationships, the ease of communication, the promise of connection.  But we must be aware of the risks, the potential consequences of our actions in this unforgiving world.  We must be mindful of the information we share, the doors we open, the windows we leave unlatched.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance we must strike, a precarious tightrope walk between the benefits and the dangers of the digital age.  We must be aware, yet not paranoid; connected, yet cautious.  For in this vast and often unforgiving expanse, our digital footprints can lead us down a path from which we may never return.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the world's collective judgment, the Iraq War stands as a barren and lifeless thing, a monument to the futility of human endeavor. It's a truth we'd rather not confront, yet one that's palpable in the air, a stench that clings to us like the ash of a long-dead fire. To speak of it now feels like a betrayal, a joining of the chorus of voices that bemoan its folly, a bandwagon we'd rather not be a part of.\n\nAnd yet, it's a truth that's inescapable. The polls, a litany of consensus, echo through the wasteland like the whispers of the dead. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, Iraqi and foreign alike, view it as a calamity, a debacle born of hubris and ignorance. Even the troops, the soldiers who toil in the quagmire, share this assessment, their voices a muted whisper in the darkness, a reluctant admission of the futility of their endeavor.\n\nIt's a disaster, a catastrophe that unfolded long before the ink was dry on the invasion plans. A disaster that's been perpetuated by the very people who promised to bring order to the chaos, to impose their brand of democracy on a culture that rejects it. The chasm between the West and the Middle East yawns wide, a gulf that's too great to bridge, a gulf that's been exacerbated by the very actions of those who sought to bridge it.\n\nWe're not the arbiters of another people's fate, nor should we pretend to be. Saddam was a monster, a tyrant who brought suffering to his own people. But to weigh the pros and cons, to balance the scales of justice, requires a wisdom we've yet to demonstrate. The cons, like quicksand, have sucked us in, ensnared us in a morass from which there's no easy escape.\n\nThe reasons for staying are thin, a threadbare excuse for a policy that's lost all coherence. The administration's hopeful ideas, like mirages on the horizon, vanish upon closer inspection. The problems of withdrawal, they say, are too great to contemplate. But I see no reason to stay, no reason to perpetuate a cycle of violence and suffering.\n\nAnd so we're left with the words of the Iraqis themselves, the people we claim to be saving, the people who tell us to leave. Eighty percent of them, a majority, demand our departure within the year. A quarter, a vocal minority, urge us to leave now. It's a message we'd do well to heed, a message that says we're not the saviors we claim to be, that we're not the solution to their problems.\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, not as long as we're imposing our will on theirs. But if we listen to their voices, if we heed their words, perhaps we can begin to crawl out of this abyss, to find a path that's not strewn with the ashes of our failed endeavors. Perhaps, just perhaps, we can find a way to leave with some semblance of dignity, to extricate ourselves from this quagmire and begin anew.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a society worn down by the relentless march of time, the specter of inequality persists. It is a ghost that haunts the corridors of progress, a specter that refuses to be vanquished by the cold light of day. The issue of gender discrimination, in particular, remains a festering wound, a reminder of the deep-seated prejudices that still linger in the recesses of our collective consciousness.\n\nIt is not a problem unique to women, for men also struggle beneath the weight of societal expectations. The glass ceiling, that impenetrable barrier that bars women from the highest echelons of power, is matched by a less visible but no less insidious bias that can afflict men in certain industries. The fashion world, for instance, is often characterized by a narrow and exclusive aesthetic, one that valorizes certain styles of life and dismisses others as superficial or frivolous.\n\nIn the rarefied realm of high society, men who dare to venture into the world of fashion are often met with suspicion and disdain. Their masculinity is called into question, their motivations seen as suspect. They are viewed as outsiders, as if their participation in this realm is somehow less authentic than that of their female counterparts. It is a pernicious form of prejudice, one that is rooted in a deep-seated discomfort with the notion of men expressing themselves through fashion.\n\nAnd yet, as we navigate this treacherous landscape, we must also acknowledge the ways in which societal norms can work to exclude those from certain backgrounds or with certain abilities. A man from a rural background, with a strong work ethic and a keen intellect, may find himself at a disadvantage when competing for positions of power. His grammar may not be polished, his accent may be rough, and yet he may possess a wisdom and a depth of character that are overlooked in favor of more polished, more refined candidates.\n\nSo too, women who choose to stay at home and raise their children may be met with scorn and derision, their choices seen as somehow less valid than those of their counterparts in the workforce. And yet, as the world changes, as we slowly but inexorably move towards a more enlightened understanding of what it means to be human, we must recognize that these biases are not inherent, but rather a product of a particular set of cultural and historical circumstances.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we must work to promote understanding and empathy, to challenge the status quo and to create a more inclusive, more compassionate society. It is a slow and difficult process, one that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to listen to and learn from those who may hold different perspectives. But as we strive towards this goal, we must remember that change is possible, that even the most entrenched biases can be overcome with time, effort, and a willingness to see the world in a different light.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of whether we can overcome these biases, but rather when. For in a world that is increasingly global, increasingly interconnected, we have no choice but to recognize the inherent value and worth of every individual, regardless of their background, their abilities, or their choices. We must see the world in all its complexity, in all its messiness, and strive to create a society that is truly just, truly equitable, and truly reflective of the diversity that makes us human.",
            "In a land where laws lay like the ashes of a burned world, the notion of what was once a transgression had been reduced to naught but a citation, a mere ticket to be paid and forgotten. The legalization of a certain substance, a plant once shunned and reviled, had brought forth a new era of tolerance, or perhaps merely a shrugging of the shoulders. The city of Denver, where the winds of progress howled like a mournful sigh, had taken the first step, a hesitant giant lumbering forth into the light.\n\nThe cost of arresting, booking, and housing those who partook in this once-forbidden pastime had been a weighty burden, a millstone around the neck of the municipal coffers. But now, with the weight lifted, the city's purse was free to attend to more pressing matters: the education of its youth, the care of its elderly, and the feeding of its hungry. A windfall, some would say, but others would caution that the devil was in the details.\n\nFor in a world where the boundaries between right and wrong had grown hazy, the specter of a substance-fueled society loomed large. The streets, once a battleground of competing interests, now teetered on the edge of a new reality, one where the line between indulgence and debasement was blurred. The taboo, that unseen hand that guided the masses, seemed to falter, its grip weakening with each passing day.\n\nSome would argue that the effects of this substance, while perhaps not as debilitating as those of its more potent cousin, held its own set of perils. The lifestyle it fostered, a world of lounging and lethargy, was a far cry from the dynamism that had once driven humanity forward. And yet, others would counter that each individual was unique, a snowflake in a world of chaos, and that the effects of this substance, like those of any other, were as varied as the stars in the night sky.\n\nIn the end, it was a matter of perspective, a matter of weighing the pros and cons, of considering the world as it was, and the world as it might be. For in a land where the winds of change howled through the streets, the only constant was uncertainty, and the only truth was that nothing was as it seemed.\n\nIn this world, where the language of morality was constantly in flux, the question remained: what was the true cost of progress? Was it the freedom to indulge, or the freedom to choose? Only time would tell, as the city of Denver, like a ship sailing into the unknown, charted its course through the uncharted waters of a new era.",
            "The truth is, I'd say yes. Because in the end, it's the beauty of tradition that endures. Like the rituals we cling to, day in and day out. The comfort of familiar patterns, worn smooth by the passage of time. It's a thing to be cherished, a bulwark against the void. But, like the shifting sands of the desert, we must adapt, must yield to the forces of change. The Catholic Church, with its doctrine and dogma, is a behemoth of tradition, a monolith that stands steadfast against the currents of the world. Yet, in its strict adherence to the past, it often forgets the very principles it holds dear. The love of others, a tenet of the faith, is oft subverted by the intolerance that masquerades as orthodoxy. It's a disease that infects the body of the Church, a cancer that eats away at its very soul.\n\nThe hypocrisy is palpable, a stench that clings to the fabric of the institution like a shroud. We are taught to love, yet we are not taught to accept. We are taught to follow the dogma, no matter the cost. It's a relic of a bygone era, a fossilized remnant of a time long past. And yet, the Church clings to it, a stubborn, blind creature driven by a will to survive, rather than a desire to evolve.\n\nAs for the issue of priests marrying, I'm not convinced it's the solution to the problem of pedophilia. Those who would prey on the innocent do so out of a diseased heart, not a lack of a spouse. Marriage or no marriage, they would still act, driven by their twisted desires. It's a sickness that cannot be cured by a simple change in circumstances. But, I suppose, it's a step in the right direction, a nod to the reality of human nature. After all, we are creatures of flesh and blood, subject to the frailties and weaknesses that beset us all.\n\nIn the end, it's not the institution that matters, but the individuals who comprise it. And it's the individuals who must be held accountable for their actions, not the rituals and dogma that surround them. The Church may be a vessel, but it's the people who fill it, who give it life, who make it holy. And it's the people who must be judged, not the structures that they inhabit.",
            "The mire of this issue thickens, a Gordian knot of conflicting sentiments. To address it, one must navigate the thin line between the sacred and the secular, the state and the church. Marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil union to others. Yet, is it not the latter, a bond between two individuals, that should be recognized by the government? The lines blur, and I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this debate. If marriage is a sacrament, then perhaps it should be left to the churches to define, lest the government meddles in the affairs of the divine. But if it is a civil union, then why not extend the same rights, the same privileges, to all who enter into such a bond, regardless of the manner in which they are joined?\n\nI do not pretend to have an answer, nor do I propose a solution. The issue seems too complex, too fraught with the potential for hurt and division. Yet, if we are to address it, we must do so with care and sensitivity. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? It seems a heavy-handed approach, one that disregards the nuance and complexity of this issue. The Constitution should not be amended for the whims of a minority, no matter how passionate their cause.\n\nAnd so, I stand at a remove, uncertain and unclear. The debate rages on, a maelstrom of opinion and emotion. I can only hope that, in the end, reason and compassion will prevail.",
            "In the shadow of my upbringing, a Christian home, I have come to regard the issue of homosexuality as a labyrinth of ambiguity. The lines that once seemed so clear have grown indistinct, like the outlines of a landscape shrouded in mist. My friendships with individuals who identify as gay have only served to muddle the waters further. I am torn between the certainties of my upbringing and the complexities of the world around me.\n\nThe question of legalization hangs in the balance, a pendulum swinging between the poles of acceptance and rejection. I do not subscribe to the notion that it should be a national issue, a matter for the president to dictate. Each state, with its unique character and values, should be free to chart its own course. The democratic states, with their liberal leanings, will likely champion the cause, while the more conservative states will resist. In such a scenario, it is the individual who chooses to reside in a given state who must abide by its laws and customs. I propose that we grant homosexuals the same rights and opportunities as their heterosexual counterparts, leaving the decision to legalize same-sex marriage to the discretion of each state.\n\nThe notion that the president should impose his will on the entire nation is a notion I find troubling. George Bush, for instance, has seen fit to ban gay marriage, but his authority extends only to the office he occupies. He does not reside in every state, and it is the people of each state who should decide how they wish to govern themselves. The president's tenure is fleeting, and with the passage of time, the pendulum will swing once more. It is the states, with their distinctive cultures and values, that must bear the weight of this decision, not the president.\n\nI do not condone the notion that the president should impose his will on the nation. In the end, it is the individual states that must live with the consequences of their decisions. I do not believe it is for the president to dictate how each state should govern itself.",
            "The notion of privacy in a world where the very fabric of the internet hangs like a gossamer thread for all to see is a tenuous thing. A public platform like Myspace, where one's thoughts and words are laid bare for the world to scrutinize, invites the gaze of others. The school officials, with their desire to safeguard the students, might see it as a necessary intrusion, a means to prevent the very horrors that have befallen places like Columbine. But does this not tread a fine line between protection and invasion?\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between public and private have grown increasingly blurred, it is a question of what we mean by 'public'. Is it not true that anything placed upon the internet is, in effect, a public declaration? And does this not give those who govern the right to intervene, to prevent the spread of ideas that might lead to harm? The notion that the internet is a sanctuary of sorts, a place where one can freely express oneself without consequence, is a myth. The digital trail we leave behind is a testament to our every thought, our every action.\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher of mine, a discussion about the measures taken to ensure the safety of the students. The lockdown drills, the protocols in place for instances of violence. It was a means to prepare for the worst, to prevent the unthinkable. And is this not what the school officials were attempting to do in this case? To prevent a tragedy, to safeguard the students? The line between invasion and protection is thin, and it is a line that we must continually reassess in this brave new world of ours.\n\nThe ease with which we can express ourselves online is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows us to convey our thoughts and feelings to a vast audience. On the other, it leaves us vulnerable to the prying eyes of others. We are our own worst enemies in this regard, our fears and doubts laid bare for all to see. And once something is posted online, it is there forever, a digital scar that cannot be erased.\n\nIt is a delicate balance we must strike, one that requires us to weigh the importance of freedom of expression against the need for protection. And it is a balance that will continue to shift, as the world around us evolves and adapts. But in the end, it is a question of what we value most: our right to express ourselves, or our right to be safe.",
            "In the blackened expanse of a mind still reeling from the aftershocks of a distant atrocity, the disquieting echoes of nine-eleven lingered like a miasma. A wound that refused to close, it festering and festering until it became an open sore that wept with every passing day. In its wake, a tide of emotion swept across the nation, a maelstrom of anger and fear that threatened to consume all in its path. And in the midst of this tempest, a decision was made to intervene, to insert ourselves into the crucible of a foreign land, to remake it in our own image. But the hubris of this endeavor was a siren's call, luring us into the treacherous waters of a conflict that would prove to be a quagmire, a quicksand that sucked in the unwary and spat out the broken.\n\nAt first, the zeal to act was a palpable thing, a fire that burned bright and hot, consuming all in its path. But as the embers of that initial fervor cooled, the outlines of a more nuanced reality began to emerge. The people we sought to save were not so easily saved, their struggles and triumphs a far cry from our own. War, for them, was a different beast, a savagery that knew no quarter, a endless cycle of violence and retaliation. And we, with our idealism and our hubris, had stumbled into this maelstrom unprepared, our plans a ragged and tattered thing, our motivations a mix of revenge and benevolence.\n\nIn the end, it was this lack of preparation, this failure to grasp the intricacies of a foreign land and its people, that would prove to be our undoing. We had gone in with a sense of superiority, of a civilizing force, but what we found was a complex tapestry of hatreds and resentments, a skein of rivalries and vendettas that we could not untangle. And so we became embroiled, our presence a constant thorn in the side of the very people we sought to help, our efforts to impose order and stability thwarted at every turn.\n\nNow, looking back, it is clear that we were mistaken, that our intervention was a folly, a well-intentioned but catastrophic mistake. We had thought to remake the world in our image, but what we created was a mess, a chaos of conflicting interests and unbridgeable divides. And so we must now extricate ourselves, withdraw from this quagmire, and let the people of that land find their own way. For we are not the ones to change them, to impose our will upon them. They are a people with their own history, their own culture, and their own destiny. And it is time for us to acknowledge this, to recognize the limits of our power, and to withdraw, humbled and chastened, from this foreign soil.\n\nBut the memories of that fateful day linger, a ghostly presence that haunts our collective psyche, a reminder of the perils of hubris and the dangers of intervention. And so we must learn from this, must recognize the limits of our power, and must strive to be more mindful in our actions, to think more carefully before we act, to consider the long-term consequences of our decisions. For in the end, it is not the mighty who shall inherit the earth, but the wise, the cautious, and the humble."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the depths of a world where shadows of doubt crept in, where the once unshakeable foundations of the Catholic Church wavered, a whispered question arose. Do they cling to the familiar, or do they surrender to the tides of change? The institution, once a bastion of tradition, now teetered on the precipice, its grip on the faithful beginning to loosen. The winds of time howled through its halls, casting aspersions on the Church's rigid stance on matters of the heart.\n\nLike a withered leaf, the Church's views on certain issues – the sanctity of life, the bonds of love, the sacraments of birth and death – seemed to cling tenuously to the branches of time, yellowed and brittle. The world outside moved forward, its pace quickening with each passing day, while the Church's stance remained frozen, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIt was said that the faithful were deserting, their numbers dwindling as the Church's rigidity only served to drive them further away. The din of dissent grew louder, a cacophony of voices that echoed through the desolate landscape of a world in flux. The Church's stance on matters of the heart seemed to be an anachronism, a stubborn refusal to bend in the face of changing times.\n\nOne could not help but wonder, in a world where love and compassion were the guiding principles, why the Church clung so tenaciously to its dogma. Why, in a world where the bonds of family and community were stretched taut, did the Church insist on its doctrine of celibacy? The question hung in the air, a challenge to the very fabric of the institution.\n\nThe winds of change howled on, a maelstrom that threatened to consume the Church whole. And yet, in the midst of the turmoil, a glimmer of hope flickered, a whispered promise that the Church might yet find a way to adapt, to bend without breaking. For in a world where love and acceptance were the keys to salvation, perhaps the Church's greatest challenge lay not in resisting the tides of change, but in embracing them.\n\nIn this desolate landscape, where the very foundations of the Church trembled, a question echoed through the void: could the Catholic Church find a way to reconcile its ancient traditions with the demands of a new world? Or would it succumb to the weight of its own rigidity, lost in a sea of time? Only the future held the answer, a future that hung precariously in the balance, like a leaf on the winds of change.",
            "The world is not a canvas for our petty judgments. It is a tapestry of complexities, woven from threads of fate and circumstance. And yet, we find ourselves drawn into the vortex of moral absolutes, our minds grasping for certainties in a sea of uncertainty. I, like many, have found myself adrift in this maelstrom, struggling to find footing on the shifting sands of opinion. The question of gay marriage, a topic that has gained prominence in these tumultuous times, has been a source of consternation for me.\n\nAs I ponder the issue, I am reminded of the fundamental truth that we are not born as blank slates, waiting to be inscribed with the characters of our destiny. Our very existence is a tapestry of choices and circumstances, yet there are some things that lie beyond our control. The same goes for the question of sexual orientation. It is a mystery, a labyrinth that we navigate without the benefit of a map or compass. We are not born with the choices of our lives already made, but with the capacity to forge our own path.\n\nThe notion that a person's sexual orientation is a choice, a conscious decision to defy societal norms, strikes me as a fallacy. It is a sentiment that reeks of a narrow-mindedness that seeks to impose its will on the complexities of human nature. Gay people, like all of us, are not aberrations, but rather an integral part of the human experience.\n\nTo deny them the right to marriage, to love, and to live their lives as they see fit, is to perpetuate a false narrative that we are the sole arbiters of what is right and wrong. It is a hubris that forgets that our understanding of the world is but a mere fraction of the grand tapestry. We are not the authors of the script, but merely characters in a story that is being written by forces beyond our comprehension.\n\nThe federal government, in its attempts to regulate the private lives of its citizens, oversteps its bounds. It is not our duty to impose our moral vision on others, but rather to create a society that allows individuals to live their lives as they see fit, so long as they do not harm others. It is a delicate balance, one that requires us to be mindful of our own limitations and the infinite complexities of human nature.\n\nIn the end, it is not for us to judge, but to allow. To create a world where love knows no bounds, where people can be themselves without fear of persecution or marginalization. It is a world that is not yet realized, but one that we must strive for, lest we forget the simple truth that we are all human, bound together by our shared experiences and our capacity for compassion.",
            "In the desolate expanse of this cold and forsaken land, where the tree of reason seems to wither and die, there remains a beacon of hope - the hope for equality, for the unwavering pursuit of justice, and for the unrelenting quest for truth. The issue of gay marriage is a matter of stark simplicity, a binary choice between the light of acceptance and the dark of prejudice. And yet, the fervent opposition to it is a palpable force, a maelstrom of fear and misunderstanding that threatens to consume us all.\n\nThe notion that homosexual couples pose a threat to the institution of heterosexual marriage is a canard, a feeble excuse for the intolerance that festers in the hearts of those who cling to the status quo. The truth is, the essence of marriage is not bound by the shackles of biology, but by the indomitable spirit of love and commitment. Two individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, can form a bond that is just as strong, just as deep, and just as worthy of recognition as any other.\n\nThe defense of civil rights is not a partisan issue, nor is it a matter of personal opinion. It is a fundamental human right, a cornerstone of our democracy, and a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of compassion. The struggles of gay couples are not unlike those of any other couple - they face the same trials, the same tribulations, and the same triumphs. And it is precisely this shared humanity that we must acknowledge and celebrate, rather than deny and exclude.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a sacrosanct principle, one that has been enshrined in our Constitution. To allow the government to codify the tenets of a particular faith, be it Christianity or any other, is to invite the kind of hypocrisy that has ravaged our society for far too long. The phrase \"separate but equal\" has been used to justify the most heinous of injustices, and it is our duty to reject its pernicious influence once and for all.\n\nThe fear of the unknown, the fear of change, and the fear of difference are powerful engines of intolerance. They fuel the fires of prejudice, and they fuel the flames of hatred. But they are also the very things that we must confront, that we must overcome, and that we must vanquish if we are to create a society that is just, equitable, and fair for all.\n\nThe scientific community has spoken, and it is clear that homosexual relationships are not inherently defective, nor are they a product of childhood trauma or personal pathology. The American Psychological Association has weighed in, and its findings are unequivocal - the notion that gay people are somehow flawed or inferior is a myth, a lie, and a calumny.\n\nIn the end, it is not about politics, or ideology, or even morality. It is about humanity. It is about our capacity for compassion, our ability to empathize, and our willingness to see the world through the eyes of another. It is about recognizing that we are not so different, that we are all part of a shared human experience, and that our differences are what make us strong, not weak.\n\nSo let us not be swayed by the siren song of fear, of intolerance, and of ignorance. Let us not be deterred by the opposition of those who would seek to deny us our basic human rights. Let us stand tall, let us stand proud, and let us demand that our voices be heard. For in the end, it is not just about gay marriage - it is about the very fabric of our society, and the kind of world we want to create for ourselves and for future generations.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital, a summer's toil, I find myself entwined with the shadows of the pharmacy. The shadows cast by the fluorescent lights, a cold and unforgiving glow that seeps into the very marrow of one's bones. It is here, amidst the sterile counters and the rows of bottles, that I find myself grappling with the complexities of a world in flux. The question that hangs in the air, like a specter, is one of morality and the role of the forbidden. \n\nJust because a substance is proscribed, does it not possess some hidden virtue? Does its utility in the realm of medicine not outweigh the taboos that surround it? I think of the oxycodone and the Vicodin, the Percocet, used by my colleagues with frequency and with purpose. These are drugs, I am told, that hold no place in the world of the uninhibited. Yet, in the world of the hospital, they are nothing short of essential. The distinction, it seems to me, is a curious one.\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is a tired one. We all know the perils of excess, the ruin that can be wrought by overindulgence. But the similarities between the two substances are limited. The danger lies, I think, not in the substance itself, but in the manner of its use. Remove the stigma, the shroud of prohibition, and perhaps, just perhaps, we may find a more responsible path.\n\nThe image of marijuana, a caricature of a substance, held in the public eye, is one of degradation and decay. It is a picture of a world gone mad, of lives ruined by the very thing that might have brought solace. But is this image not a distortion? Is it not a product of our own fears and our own biases? I think of the heroin and the cocaine, the true scourges of our time. The comparison to marijuana is a false one, a convenient smokescreen designed to obscure the truth.\n\nIn the end, it is not the substance itself that is the problem, but our own perceptions, our own fears. Remove the taboos, the shrouds of prohibition, and perhaps, just perhaps, we may find a new path, a path of responsibility and of reason.",
            "The church has undergone a metamorphosis, its staid traditions yielding to the demands of the twenty-first century. The once rigid facade now appears more relaxed, a facade worn down by the gentle lapping of time. As a child, I was accustomed to Sundays spent within its hallowed halls, my attire a pristine, cookie-cutter reflection of the expectations that governed my early years. Matching dresses, shoes, and purses – a uniform that signified not only my belonging but also my devotion. Those were simpler times, ones that waned as I grew older.\n\nAt my private school, I would catch glimpses of my friends on weekends, all of us hurrying to and fro, our footsteps echoing within the church's hallowed walls. But as the years passed, the church adapted, its rituals condensed to thirty minutes, a hurried sacrifice to the pace of modern life. Summer mornings saw families arrive in beach attire, the very emblem of a world in disarray. Even morning masses, once a bastion of propriety, now welcomed the casual, the jeans and khakis a testament to a more relaxed era.\n\nAs I reflect on my experiences, I am struck by the changing times, the church a reflection of the world at large. I do not pretend to understand the inner workings of the church's politics, nor do I wish to delve into the complex web of allegations surrounding its clergy. My observations, though limited, suggest that the church's strictures did little to prevent the scourge of pedophilia.\n\nThe notion that allowing female priests or married priests would have made a difference is a notion I find difficult to accept. Pedophilia, I believe, is a product of an individual's nature, a predisposition that cannot be altered by the trappings of marriage or the blessings of the church. Even in faiths that permit marriage among their clergy, the aberrant individual will still find a way to indulge their baser desires. It is a choice, a choice made by the individual, not by the institution.\n\nIn the end, it seems to me that the church's inability to prevent these atrocities lies not in its practices but in the human condition. We are what we are, our inclinations shaped by forces beyond our control, genetics a primary driver of our nature. The church, in its attempts to police the desires of its clergy, may have been misguided, but it was not the root cause of this evil.\n\nAs I reflect on the church's place in the world, I am left with more questions than answers. Its role, once a beacon of hope and guidance, now seems a complex, multifaceted entity, one that must confront the darker aspects of human nature.",
            "The ghosts of September's ash still clung to the land like the stench of death on a winter's morning. The memories of that day, like the embers of a long-dead fire, continued to smolder, refusing to be extinguished. The administration's pyre of deceit had been built upon the altar of fear, and the flames of war had consumed the nation. The rhetoric of lies had been woven like a tapestry of deceit, with Saddam Hussein as the thread, Osama Bin Laden as the hook, and the WMDs as the bait.\n\nThe echoes of Colin Powell's hollow words still lingered in the air, a haunted whisper of a man who knew the truth but chose to ignore it. The evidence, like the desert sand, had shifted and slid, revealing the cracks in the administration's facade. The Constitution, that sacred document, had been cast aside like a worn and tattered cloak, trampled by the boots of power.\n\nThe younger Bush, driven by a vendetta born of blood and pride, had set his sights on Baghdad, his eyes fixed on the prize of oil, that black gold that flowed like lifeblood through the veins of the nation. The pretext, a flimsy thing, had been used to justify the slaughter, the terror, the devastation. The world had been fooled, convinced by the sweet whispers of a lie.\n\nAnd now, as the years had passed, the truth had begun to seep through the cracks, like water through the parched earth. The country teetered on the brink of chaos, a fragile thing, balanced precariously between the competing interests of the nations that had come to claim its prize. The Iraqi government, a fragile leaf, was blown by the winds of dissension, its sovereignty threatened by the very powers that had claimed to liberate it.\n\nThe Parliament, a gathering of disparate voices, was a cacophony of discord, a reminder that the Iraqis were not a people to be trifled with. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, was a mere puppet on a string, pulled by the invisible hands of the foreign powers that had brought him to power. The shadow of al-Sadr loomed large, a specter of rebellion, a reminder that the fire of resistance still burned bright.\n\nAnd so, the nation teetered, a delicate balance of power, a house of cards waiting to be blown down. The ghosts of September still lingered, a reminder of the horrors that had been unleashed. The lies, the deceit, the bloodshed – all of it still echoed through the halls of history, a grim reminder of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "I sat in the cold, my words lost in the void. The wind howled through the trees like a mournful cry, a dirge for the lost and the forgotten. I tried to speak, but the words would not come. Just a hollow murmur, a murmur that was swallowed by the silence.\n\nI cleared my throat, and began again. The War in Iraq. A conflict without end, a morass of blood and ash. I felt a sense of futility, a sense that our efforts were as fleeting as the wind that swept through the desolate landscape.\n\nIt was a war without a clear purpose, a war without a declared end. A war born of anger and revenge, of a desire to punish and to dominate. I thought of the children, the sons and daughters lost in the conflict, their lives forever changed by the violence and the bloodshed.\n\nI thought of the terrible weight of responsibility, the burden of power that rested on the shoulders of those who had unleashed this war. The promise of democracy, of freedom and prosperity, had been reduced to a hollow mantra, a justification for the destruction and the chaos that had been wrought.\n\nAnd yet, I was torn. I felt a sense of loyalty to those who had served, who had risked everything to defend a cause that was noble and just. But I also felt a sense of unease, a sense that our presence in Iraq was a cancer, a poison that was eating away at the very fabric of the country.\n\nI thought of the words of my predecessors, the ones who had spoken of the importance of engagement, of the need to build a better world. But I knew that words were cheap, that the cost of war was measured in blood and tears, not in empty rhetoric.\n\nI sighed, my breath misting in the cold air. The War in Iraq was a labyrinth, a maze of conflicting desires and ideologies. I did not know what to say, what to think. All I knew was that I was lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty and doubt.\n\nI paused, collecting my thoughts. Perhaps, I thought, the war was not just about Iraq, but about us. About our own fears and insecurities, our own need for power and control. Perhaps it was a reflection of our own darkness, our own shadow self.\n\nI looked out at the desolate landscape, the wind-whipped trees and the ash-stained rocks. It was a landscape of death and despair, a landscape that seemed to stretch on forever. And I knew that I was just a small part of it, a small part of a larger tapestry that was torn and frayed.\n\nI fell silent, my words lost in the void. The wind howled on, a mournful cry that seemed to echo through the ages.",
            "In the desolate landscape of politics, a canonical question hangs like a specter, shrouded in the murk of constitutional ambiguity. The separation of church and state, that bedrock principle of the American foundational text, stands as a bulwark against the encroachment of ecclesiastical power into the temporal realm. And yet, a proposed amendment seeks to upset this delicate balance, to insinuate the government's hand into the very fabric of faith, a move that would contravene the sacred compact of separation.\n\nThe constitution, that venerable document, speaks plainly on this matter, its words a testament to the founders' genius and foresight. And yet, in a seeming disregard for the written word, the proponents of this amendment would seek to impose their will, to impose their narrow vision on a nation founded on the principles of liberty and tolerance. The very notion is anathema to the spirit of American democracy, a spirit that prizes freedom above all else.\n\nIn the councils of power, a subtle but insidious force is at work, one that would reduce the rich tapestry of faith to a monolith of state-defined orthodoxy. The irony is not lost on those who would see this amendment as a thinly veiled attempt to privilege one creed over all others. And so they rail against the very idea, seeing in it a testament to the creeping influence of theocracy.\n\nThe economy, that great engine of progress, would be little affected, yet the proposed amendment would have far-reaching consequences, insidiously chipping away at the bedrock of American freedom. The societal impact, too, would be profound, as the very fabric of our national identity would be reshaped by the imposition of a state-defined dogma.\n\nIn the end, it is not for the state to dictate the terms of the divine, nor is it for the government to impose its will on the faithful. The churches, those venerable institutions of faith, must be free to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. For in the words of the constitution, the distinction between church and state is not a suggestion, but a fundamental imperative, a bulwark against the tyranny of the majority and the oppression of the minority.\n\nIn this, the proposed amendment would be a calamity, a betrayal of the trust that has been placed in us as citizens. We must stand against this thinly veiled attempt to subvert the constitution, to undermine the very foundations of our democracy. For in the words of the great American jurist, the constitution is not a document to be tinkered with, but a sacred trust, a beacon of hope in a world beset by darkness and despair.\n\nUltimately, it is not for the federal government, nor any government, to dictate the terms of faith. It is for the churches, those institutions of faith, to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. And so we must resist this amendment, this thinly veiled attempt to impose a state-defined dogma on a nation founded on the principles of liberty and tolerance. For in the end, it is not the state that should dictate the terms of the divine, but the faithful, free to worship as they see fit, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the government.",
            "The scar of war remains in the memory like a festering wound, a constant reminder of the deceit that festered in the heart of our nation. The invasion of Iraq, a calamitous event born of half-truths and misinformation, left an indelible stain on the conscience of our country. The government's motivations, shrouded in a veil of secrecy, were as opaque as the darkness that descended upon the land.\n\nLike a rot that had set deep within the bone, the reasons for war were infected with the germ of dishonesty. The government's attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the atrocities of 9/11, a connection as tenuous as the threads of a spider's web, was a palpable lie. Yet, it was a lie that resonated deeply with the American people, their emotions manipulated by the government's skilled artisans of propaganda. The echoes of that deceit still linger, a testament to the ease with which we can be led astray by the whispers of those in power.\n\nAs I reflect on the war in Iraq, I am reminded of the terrible toll it took on our nation. The countless lives lost, the families shattered, the futures forever altered. A war that seemed to promise a swift and easy victory, but instead became a quagmire of blood and chaos, a lesson we failed to learn from the mistakes of Vietnam. The government, blinded by its own hubris, failed to grasp the complexity of the situation, and the people paid the price.\n\nThe void left by the removal of Saddam's regime was a chasm as vast as the one that yawns between the promise and the reality of democracy. The government, like a ship without anchor, was swept up in the currents of its own ambition, failing to chart a course that would lead to a stable and peaceful outcome. The aftermath of the invasion was a maelstrom of violence and chaos, as the country was left to pick up the pieces of a shattered society.\n\nAs I grapple with the weight of these events, I am reminded of the words of my own father, who once spoke of the importance of planning for all possible outcomes. But in the rush to war, the government was woefully unprepared for the consequences of its actions. The loss of life, the destruction of infrastructure, the displacement of people – all of these were consequences that could have been foreseen, but were willfully ignored.\n\nThe war in Iraq serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of accountability. It is a cautionary tale of the devastating consequences of a government that prioritizes its own interests above the welfare of its people. As I look back on the events that transpired, I am left with a sense of sadness and regret, a feeling that we were complicit in our own downfall.\n\nThe question of whether we should have gone to war remains a difficult one, a Gordian knot that twists and turns in the mind. But one thing is certain – the war in Iraq was a catastrophic mistake, a tragedy that will haunt us for generations to come. As we move forward, we must learn from our mistakes and strive to create a world where the rule of law and the principles of justice are upheld. Anything less would be a betrayal of the very ideals that we claim to represent.\n\nThe scars of war will take a long time to heal, but it is in the darkness that we find the true measure of our character. It is in the willingness to confront the truth, to acknowledge our mistakes, and to strive for a better future. As we move forward, let us remember the lessons of Iraq, and may we emerge from the ashes of our hubris, wiser and more compassionate, our hearts heavy with the knowledge of what we have lost, and our spirits renewed by the promise of a brighter tomorrow.",
            "The air was heavy with the weight of what could not be said. He hesitated, the words caught in his throat like a choking ember. Gay marriage. A flame that flickered in the depths of his being, a fire that had long since burned away the shadows of doubt. It was a thing of the heart, not the mind, a whispered promise in the dark. He thought of the couples in his neighborhood, their love a beacon in the desolate landscape of his world. They walked the streets, their dogs by their side, just as any other family would. But to be recognized, to be acknowledged, was to invite the darkness of judgment.\n\nHe spoke of the biological, the chemical whispers in the brain, the predisposition that could not be changed. It was a thing of science, not society, a truth that stood apart from the fallible words of men. He thought of his own childhood, the absence of a father, the presence of sisters, and wondered if it made him any less a man. The sociological, the cultural, the expectations of a world that would not understand. It was all a web of deceit, a spider's snare that sought to entangle and ensnare.\n\nMarriage, a sacred bond, a union of two souls, was it not a thing of the heart, not the law? He thought of the couples who fled to Vegas, their love a secret, a stolen moment in the desert. But for those who loved in the shadows, in the silence, who spoke of love as a right, not a privilege. He thought of the newspapers, the headlines, the scrutinizing eyes of a world that would not be swayed. It was a thing of the public domain, of the federal, of the laws that bound and gagged the heart.\n\nHe shook his head, a slow, deliberate motion, as if to clear the cobwebs from his mind. The words, the arguments, the rationalizations, they were all mere smoke, a mist that obscured the truth. He thought of the couples, the love that shone like a beacon in the darkness, and knew that it was not for him to decide. It was for them to choose, to love, to live, to be.\n\nHis voice, a low, measured tone, cut through the air like a knife. I am for gay marriage. It is a thing of the heart, a flame that burns bright and true, a love that knows no bounds. It is a personal preference, a choice, a decision that should be left to those who love, not to the whims of men who would seek to dictate the terms of the heart.",
            "The thin veil of the digital realm, once thought to be a sanctuary, now hangs heavy with the weight of consequence. When words are set loose upon the winds of the internet, they are like autumn leaves, scattered and impossible to contain. The public forum, a landscape once traversed by the whispers of friends and acquaintances, has become a thoroughfare for the reckless and the malicious.\n\nAs an RA, I have witnessed the catastrophic aftermath of thoughtless utterances, the shards of shattered reputations that litter the digital terrain like the splintered remnants of a shattered glass. The ephemeral nature of online discourse belies its far-reaching consequences, for once released, words cannot be recalled. They seep into the consciousness of others, indelibly staining their perceptions.\n\nThe incident at our school serves as a stark illustration of this phenomenon. A careless remark, meant as a jest, was overheard and reported, setting in motion a chain of events that culminated in a thorough investigation. The ease with which one's digital footprint can be accessed, the lack of boundaries between the private and public spheres, is a stark reminder of the perils of online expression.\n\nIn this vast, uncharted expanse, the lines between jest and earnest are frequently blurred. The internet, a reflection of humanity's darker impulses, can amplify the most base and hurtful sentiments, rendering them audible to all. It is a realm where the distinction between intention and consequence is lost, where the ephemeral nature of words is exploited by the malicious.\n\nThe inherent lack of control, the vulnerability to the whims of others, is a reality that must be acknowledged. While school officials may not be entitled to monitor the online activities of their students, the moment a threat or concern is brought to their attention, they are duty-bound to act. It is a delicate balance, one that requires a nuanced understanding of the digital landscape and its far-reaching implications.\n\nIn this context, the creation of online personas, the friending of students, and the monitoring of their online activities are all fraught with peril. The blurring of boundaries, the invasion of privacy, can have far-reaching consequences, both for the individual and the community. It is a minefield that requires great care and sensitivity to navigate.\n\nUltimately, the internet, a double-edged sword, holds the power to both unite and divide. As we traverse this uncharted territory, we must proceed with caution, mindful of the words we choose to utter, the lines we cross, and the consequences that follow. For in the digital realm, the past and present are inextricably linked, and the shadows of our online actions can haunt us for eternity.",
            "The war, a drawn-out thing, a slow unraveling of purpose. What once was a beacon of hope, a shining light to guide us towards democracy, has lost its way. The shadow of the original intent lingers, a fleeting memory of a reason that once burned bright. Now it's a meandering path, a purpose lost in the haze of time.\n\nIn the beginning, the desire to restore democracy in another land was a noble pursuit. A crusade to free the oppressed, to give voice to those silenced by tyranny. But like a statue worn by the elements, the motive has eroded, gradually losing its shape and definition. It's become a monotonous drone, a justification for the sake of justification. A war of attrition, where the only victory is the mere act of continued existence.\n\nThe threads of our original purpose have frayed, tangled in the complexities of history. The recollections of George Bush's predecessor and Saddam Hussein's past grievances have become a tangled skein, a noose that chokes the air from our lungs. If our aim was to plant the seeds of democracy, perhaps it was not an unworthy endeavor. But when personal vendettas bleed into the equation, the endeavor becomes tainted, a poison that seeps into the very fabric of our intentions.\n\nWe've made our statement, a resounding declaration that will echo through the annals of time. But the cacophony of war has continued, a prolonged dirge that grows louder with each passing day. We've lost sight of the objective, succumbed to the siren song of war, an endless and mindless dance. The costs mount, a staggering tally of lives, a hemorrhage of our economy, a bleeding wound that refuses to clot.\n\nAnd for what? To prove our power? To assert our dominance? The nations we've been fighting to \"liberate\" have grown weary, their governments learning to fend for themselves, while our own coffers are drained, our people suffering, and our future uncertain. We've forgotten the people we set out to help, their struggles, their hopes, their dreams. We've become entangled in the quagmire of war, our own priorities lost in the mire.\n\nWe pour billions into a conflict that has long since lost its purpose, while our own cities beg for attention, our people cry out for aid. The war has become a cancer, a festering wound that refuses to heal. We've lost sight of our own priorities, our own needs, our own humanity. It's time to cut the umbilical cord, to sever the ties that bind us to this conflict. It's time to bring our soldiers home, to tend to our own wounds, to find a new path forward, a path that leads us towards a brighter future, a future where our economy thrives, our people prosper, and our hearts are not weighed down by the burden of war.",
            "In a world where the boundaries of surveillance are as indistinct as the horizon, the notion of privacy has grown tenuous.  The vast expanse of the internet, like an unforgiving desert, stretches out before us, inviting the unwary traveler to leave their footprints for all to see. Myspace, a digital agora, beckons with its promise of connection and community, yet its allure is treacherous, for in its depths, the prying eyes of strangers lurk, waiting to strike.\n\nConsider this: when we surrender our information to the void of cyberspace, we tacitly consent to its dissemination.  A friend request, a click, a keystroke – all these can be the keys that unlock a Pandora's box of scrutiny.  The notion that we can control who sees what is a myth, a chimera born of our own hubris.  The internet, a vast and insatiable creature, devours our secrets and spits them back out, unrecognizable, to the world.\n\nBut what of the individual who stumbles upon our digital trail?  Is it the voyeur, the stalker, or the guardian angel who intervenes to prevent a catastrophe?  Or is it merely the happenstance of the digital age, where information flows like a river, unregulated and unfettered?  The line between these dichotomies blurs, leaving us to navigate the treacherous shoals of the digital world, ever vigilant, yet ever vulnerable.\n\nI recall a television program I once watched, a cautionary tale of a man who reveled in his ability to uncover the hidden truths of the internet.  He stalked a young girl, gathering her digital breadcrumbs, until he had ensnared her in his web of deceit.  I shuddered at the ease with which he had accomplished this feat, the speed at which he had insinuated himself into her world.  It was a sobering reminder of the perils that lurk in the digital shadows, waiting to pounce upon the unsuspecting.\n\nAnd yet, we cannot help but be drawn to this digital promised land, this frontier of connection and community.  We crave the intimacy of online relationships, the ease of communication, the promise of connection.  But we must be aware of the risks, the potential consequences of our actions in this unforgiving world.  We must be mindful of the information we share, the doors we open, the windows we leave unlatched.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance we must strike, a precarious tightrope walk between the benefits and the dangers of the digital age.  We must be aware, yet not paranoid; connected, yet cautious.  For in this vast and often unforgiving expanse, our digital footprints can lead us down a path from which we may never return.",
            "In the desolate expanse of the world's collective judgment, the Iraq War stands as a barren and lifeless thing, a monument to the futility of human endeavor. It's a truth we'd rather not confront, yet one that's palpable in the air, a stench that clings to us like the ash of a long-dead fire. To speak of it now feels like a betrayal, a joining of the chorus of voices that bemoan its folly, a bandwagon we'd rather not be a part of.\n\nAnd yet, it's a truth that's inescapable. The polls, a litany of consensus, echo through the wasteland like the whispers of the dead. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population, Iraqi and foreign alike, view it as a calamity, a debacle born of hubris and ignorance. Even the troops, the soldiers who toil in the quagmire, share this assessment, their voices a muted whisper in the darkness, a reluctant admission of the futility of their endeavor.\n\nIt's a disaster, a catastrophe that unfolded long before the ink was dry on the invasion plans. A disaster that's been perpetuated by the very people who promised to bring order to the chaos, to impose their brand of democracy on a culture that rejects it. The chasm between the West and the Middle East yawns wide, a gulf that's too great to bridge, a gulf that's been exacerbated by the very actions of those who sought to bridge it.\n\nWe're not the arbiters of another people's fate, nor should we pretend to be. Saddam was a monster, a tyrant who brought suffering to his own people. But to weigh the pros and cons, to balance the scales of justice, requires a wisdom we've yet to demonstrate. The cons, like quicksand, have sucked us in, ensnared us in a morass from which there's no easy escape.\n\nThe reasons for staying are thin, a threadbare excuse for a policy that's lost all coherence. The administration's hopeful ideas, like mirages on the horizon, vanish upon closer inspection. The problems of withdrawal, they say, are too great to contemplate. But I see no reason to stay, no reason to perpetuate a cycle of violence and suffering.\n\nAnd so we're left with the words of the Iraqis themselves, the people we claim to be saving, the people who tell us to leave. Eighty percent of them, a majority, demand our departure within the year. A quarter, a vocal minority, urge us to leave now. It's a message we'd do well to heed, a message that says we're not the saviors we claim to be, that we're not the solution to their problems.\n\nWe'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, not as long as we're imposing our will on theirs. But if we listen to their voices, if we heed their words, perhaps we can begin to crawl out of this abyss, to find a path that's not strewn with the ashes of our failed endeavors. Perhaps, just perhaps, we can find a way to leave with some semblance of dignity, to extricate ourselves from this quagmire and begin anew.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a society worn down by the relentless march of time, the specter of inequality persists. It is a ghost that haunts the corridors of progress, a specter that refuses to be vanquished by the cold light of day. The issue of gender discrimination, in particular, remains a festering wound, a reminder of the deep-seated prejudices that still linger in the recesses of our collective consciousness.\n\nIt is not a problem unique to women, for men also struggle beneath the weight of societal expectations. The glass ceiling, that impenetrable barrier that bars women from the highest echelons of power, is matched by a less visible but no less insidious bias that can afflict men in certain industries. The fashion world, for instance, is often characterized by a narrow and exclusive aesthetic, one that valorizes certain styles of life and dismisses others as superficial or frivolous.\n\nIn the rarefied realm of high society, men who dare to venture into the world of fashion are often met with suspicion and disdain. Their masculinity is called into question, their motivations seen as suspect. They are viewed as outsiders, as if their participation in this realm is somehow less authentic than that of their female counterparts. It is a pernicious form of prejudice, one that is rooted in a deep-seated discomfort with the notion of men expressing themselves through fashion.\n\nAnd yet, as we navigate this treacherous landscape, we must also acknowledge the ways in which societal norms can work to exclude those from certain backgrounds or with certain abilities. A man from a rural background, with a strong work ethic and a keen intellect, may find himself at a disadvantage when competing for positions of power. His grammar may not be polished, his accent may be rough, and yet he may possess a wisdom and a depth of character that are overlooked in favor of more polished, more refined candidates.\n\nSo too, women who choose to stay at home and raise their children may be met with scorn and derision, their choices seen as somehow less valid than those of their counterparts in the workforce. And yet, as the world changes, as we slowly but inexorably move towards a more enlightened understanding of what it means to be human, we must recognize that these biases are not inherent, but rather a product of a particular set of cultural and historical circumstances.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, we must work to promote understanding and empathy, to challenge the status quo and to create a more inclusive, more compassionate society. It is a slow and difficult process, one that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to listen to and learn from those who may hold different perspectives. But as we strive towards this goal, we must remember that change is possible, that even the most entrenched biases can be overcome with time, effort, and a willingness to see the world in a different light.\n\nIn the end, it is not a question of whether we can overcome these biases, but rather when. For in a world that is increasingly global, increasingly interconnected, we have no choice but to recognize the inherent value and worth of every individual, regardless of their background, their abilities, or their choices. We must see the world in all its complexity, in all its messiness, and strive to create a society that is truly just, truly equitable, and truly reflective of the diversity that makes us human.",
            "In a land where laws lay like the ashes of a burned world, the notion of what was once a transgression had been reduced to naught but a citation, a mere ticket to be paid and forgotten. The legalization of a certain substance, a plant once shunned and reviled, had brought forth a new era of tolerance, or perhaps merely a shrugging of the shoulders. The city of Denver, where the winds of progress howled like a mournful sigh, had taken the first step, a hesitant giant lumbering forth into the light.\n\nThe cost of arresting, booking, and housing those who partook in this once-forbidden pastime had been a weighty burden, a millstone around the neck of the municipal coffers. But now, with the weight lifted, the city's purse was free to attend to more pressing matters: the education of its youth, the care of its elderly, and the feeding of its hungry. A windfall, some would say, but others would caution that the devil was in the details.\n\nFor in a world where the boundaries between right and wrong had grown hazy, the specter of a substance-fueled society loomed large. The streets, once a battleground of competing interests, now teetered on the edge of a new reality, one where the line between indulgence and debasement was blurred. The taboo, that unseen hand that guided the masses, seemed to falter, its grip weakening with each passing day.\n\nSome would argue that the effects of this substance, while perhaps not as debilitating as those of its more potent cousin, held its own set of perils. The lifestyle it fostered, a world of lounging and lethargy, was a far cry from the dynamism that had once driven humanity forward. And yet, others would counter that each individual was unique, a snowflake in a world of chaos, and that the effects of this substance, like those of any other, were as varied as the stars in the night sky.\n\nIn the end, it was a matter of perspective, a matter of weighing the pros and cons, of considering the world as it was, and the world as it might be. For in a land where the winds of change howled through the streets, the only constant was uncertainty, and the only truth was that nothing was as it seemed.\n\nIn this world, where the language of morality was constantly in flux, the question remained: what was the true cost of progress? Was it the freedom to indulge, or the freedom to choose? Only time would tell, as the city of Denver, like a ship sailing into the unknown, charted its course through the uncharted waters of a new era.",
            "The truth is, I'd say yes. Because in the end, it's the beauty of tradition that endures. Like the rituals we cling to, day in and day out. The comfort of familiar patterns, worn smooth by the passage of time. It's a thing to be cherished, a bulwark against the void. But, like the shifting sands of the desert, we must adapt, must yield to the forces of change. The Catholic Church, with its doctrine and dogma, is a behemoth of tradition, a monolith that stands steadfast against the currents of the world. Yet, in its strict adherence to the past, it often forgets the very principles it holds dear. The love of others, a tenet of the faith, is oft subverted by the intolerance that masquerades as orthodoxy. It's a disease that infects the body of the Church, a cancer that eats away at its very soul.\n\nThe hypocrisy is palpable, a stench that clings to the fabric of the institution like a shroud. We are taught to love, yet we are not taught to accept. We are taught to follow the dogma, no matter the cost. It's a relic of a bygone era, a fossilized remnant of a time long past. And yet, the Church clings to it, a stubborn, blind creature driven by a will to survive, rather than a desire to evolve.\n\nAs for the issue of priests marrying, I'm not convinced it's the solution to the problem of pedophilia. Those who would prey on the innocent do so out of a diseased heart, not a lack of a spouse. Marriage or no marriage, they would still act, driven by their twisted desires. It's a sickness that cannot be cured by a simple change in circumstances. But, I suppose, it's a step in the right direction, a nod to the reality of human nature. After all, we are creatures of flesh and blood, subject to the frailties and weaknesses that beset us all.\n\nIn the end, it's not the institution that matters, but the individuals who comprise it. And it's the individuals who must be held accountable for their actions, not the rituals and dogma that surround them. The Church may be a vessel, but it's the people who fill it, who give it life, who make it holy. And it's the people who must be judged, not the structures that they inhabit.",
            "The mire of this issue thickens, a Gordian knot of conflicting sentiments. To address it, one must navigate the thin line between the sacred and the secular, the state and the church. Marriage, a sacrament to some, a civil union to others. Yet, is it not the latter, a bond between two individuals, that should be recognized by the government? The lines blur, and I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this debate. If marriage is a sacrament, then perhaps it should be left to the churches to define, lest the government meddles in the affairs of the divine. But if it is a civil union, then why not extend the same rights, the same privileges, to all who enter into such a bond, regardless of the manner in which they are joined?\n\nI do not pretend to have an answer, nor do I propose a solution. The issue seems too complex, too fraught with the potential for hurt and division. Yet, if we are to address it, we must do so with care and sensitivity. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? It seems a heavy-handed approach, one that disregards the nuance and complexity of this issue. The Constitution should not be amended for the whims of a minority, no matter how passionate their cause.\n\nAnd so, I stand at a remove, uncertain and unclear. The debate rages on, a maelstrom of opinion and emotion. I can only hope that, in the end, reason and compassion will prevail.",
            "In the shadow of my upbringing, a Christian home, I have come to regard the issue of homosexuality as a labyrinth of ambiguity. The lines that once seemed so clear have grown indistinct, like the outlines of a landscape shrouded in mist. My friendships with individuals who identify as gay have only served to muddle the waters further. I am torn between the certainties of my upbringing and the complexities of the world around me.\n\nThe question of legalization hangs in the balance, a pendulum swinging between the poles of acceptance and rejection. I do not subscribe to the notion that it should be a national issue, a matter for the president to dictate. Each state, with its unique character and values, should be free to chart its own course. The democratic states, with their liberal leanings, will likely champion the cause, while the more conservative states will resist. In such a scenario, it is the individual who chooses to reside in a given state who must abide by its laws and customs. I propose that we grant homosexuals the same rights and opportunities as their heterosexual counterparts, leaving the decision to legalize same-sex marriage to the discretion of each state.\n\nThe notion that the president should impose his will on the entire nation is a notion I find troubling. George Bush, for instance, has seen fit to ban gay marriage, but his authority extends only to the office he occupies. He does not reside in every state, and it is the people of each state who should decide how they wish to govern themselves. The president's tenure is fleeting, and with the passage of time, the pendulum will swing once more. It is the states, with their distinctive cultures and values, that must bear the weight of this decision, not the president.\n\nI do not condone the notion that the president should impose his will on the nation. In the end, it is the individual states that must live with the consequences of their decisions. I do not believe it is for the president to dictate how each state should govern itself.",
            "The notion of privacy in a world where the very fabric of the internet hangs like a gossamer thread for all to see is a tenuous thing. A public platform like Myspace, where one's thoughts and words are laid bare for the world to scrutinize, invites the gaze of others. The school officials, with their desire to safeguard the students, might see it as a necessary intrusion, a means to prevent the very horrors that have befallen places like Columbine. But does this not tread a fine line between protection and invasion?\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between public and private have grown increasingly blurred, it is a question of what we mean by 'public'. Is it not true that anything placed upon the internet is, in effect, a public declaration? And does this not give those who govern the right to intervene, to prevent the spread of ideas that might lead to harm? The notion that the internet is a sanctuary of sorts, a place where one can freely express oneself without consequence, is a myth. The digital trail we leave behind is a testament to our every thought, our every action.\n\nI recall a conversation with a teacher of mine, a discussion about the measures taken to ensure the safety of the students. The lockdown drills, the protocols in place for instances of violence. It was a means to prepare for the worst, to prevent the unthinkable. And is this not what the school officials were attempting to do in this case? To prevent a tragedy, to safeguard the students? The line between invasion and protection is thin, and it is a line that we must continually reassess in this brave new world of ours.\n\nThe ease with which we can express ourselves online is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows us to convey our thoughts and feelings to a vast audience. On the other, it leaves us vulnerable to the prying eyes of others. We are our own worst enemies in this regard, our fears and doubts laid bare for all to see. And once something is posted online, it is there forever, a digital scar that cannot be erased.\n\nIt is a delicate balance we must strike, one that requires us to weigh the importance of freedom of expression against the need for protection. And it is a balance that will continue to shift, as the world around us evolves and adapts. But in the end, it is a question of what we value most: our right to express ourselves, or our right to be safe.",
            "In the blackened expanse of a mind still reeling from the aftershocks of a distant atrocity, the disquieting echoes of nine-eleven lingered like a miasma. A wound that refused to close, it festering and festering until it became an open sore that wept with every passing day. In its wake, a tide of emotion swept across the nation, a maelstrom of anger and fear that threatened to consume all in its path. And in the midst of this tempest, a decision was made to intervene, to insert ourselves into the crucible of a foreign land, to remake it in our own image. But the hubris of this endeavor was a siren's call, luring us into the treacherous waters of a conflict that would prove to be a quagmire, a quicksand that sucked in the unwary and spat out the broken.\n\nAt first, the zeal to act was a palpable thing, a fire that burned bright and hot, consuming all in its path. But as the embers of that initial fervor cooled, the outlines of a more nuanced reality began to emerge. The people we sought to save were not so easily saved, their struggles and triumphs a far cry from our own. War, for them, was a different beast, a savagery that knew no quarter, a endless cycle of violence and retaliation. And we, with our idealism and our hubris, had stumbled into this maelstrom unprepared, our plans a ragged and tattered thing, our motivations a mix of revenge and benevolence.\n\nIn the end, it was this lack of preparation, this failure to grasp the intricacies of a foreign land and its people, that would prove to be our undoing. We had gone in with a sense of superiority, of a civilizing force, but what we found was a complex tapestry of hatreds and resentments, a skein of rivalries and vendettas that we could not untangle. And so we became embroiled, our presence a constant thorn in the side of the very people we sought to help, our efforts to impose order and stability thwarted at every turn.\n\nNow, looking back, it is clear that we were mistaken, that our intervention was a folly, a well-intentioned but catastrophic mistake. We had thought to remake the world in our image, but what we created was a mess, a chaos of conflicting interests and unbridgeable divides. And so we must now extricate ourselves, withdraw from this quagmire, and let the people of that land find their own way. For we are not the ones to change them, to impose our will upon them. They are a people with their own history, their own culture, and their own destiny. And it is time for us to acknowledge this, to recognize the limits of our power, and to withdraw, humbled and chastened, from this foreign soil.\n\nBut the memories of that fateful day linger, a ghostly presence that haunts our collective psyche, a reminder of the perils of hubris and the dangers of intervention. And so we must learn from this, must recognize the limits of our power, and must strive to be more mindful in our actions, to think more carefully before we act, to consider the long-term consequences of our decisions. For in the end, it is not the mighty who shall inherit the earth, but the wise, the cautious, and the humble."
