            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the stagnant air of dogma, the Catholic Church's rigidity seems to be calcifying its very foundation. Like a once-noble edifice worn down by the relentless passage of time, its views, once held aloft like a beacon, now appear antiquated and out of step with the world. The Church's inflexibility on matters such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control has become a barrier to its relevance, a stumbling block that is causing it to lose its hold on the faithful.\n\nThe winds of change are whispering through the corridors of history, and the Church's refusal to adapt is leaving it vulnerable to the tempests of dissent. The issue is not that the Church's views are without merit, but rather that they are seemingly frozen in a bygone era, unyielding to the currents of progress. By clinging to these outdated tenets, the Church risks losing its flock, its members drifting away like autumn leaves on a gusty day.\n\nIn an age of growing acceptance and understanding, the Church's stance on these issues seems increasingly out of sync. The result is a chasm between the faithful and those who would follow, a chasm that threatens to swallow the Church whole. The Church's rejection of abortion, for example, may be a catechism of old, but in a world where choices and opinions are increasingly nuanced, it can no longer be the sole arbiter of truth.\n\nThe notion that priests must remain celibate, that they are wedded to God alone, seems a relic of a bygone era. In a world where professionals and families coexist, where devotion and duty are not mutually exclusive, it is puzzling that the Church cannot see the value in allowing its priests to form meaningful connections with the world. The Church's stance on female priests, too, raises questions about its commitment to equality and justice. In a world where women are increasingly empowered, why should the Church lag behind?\n\nThe Church's inability to adapt has led to a crisis of faith, a sense of disillusionment that has left many questioning its relevance. Like a great oak whose branches have been pruned back, the Church risks becoming a hollow shell of its former self, a relic of a bygone era. It is time for the Church to reassess its stance on these issues, to find a middle ground that will allow it to reconnect with the world and reclaim its place as a beacon of hope and guidance.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, as the world outside recedes into the shadows, the Church must confront the darkness within. It is a darkness that threatens to consume it, to leave it a hollow husk of its former self. But it is also a darkness that holds the seed of redemption, a chance for the Church to rediscover its mission and its purpose. Let us hope that it will seize this opportunity, that it will find a way to heal the schisms and reconnect with the world.",
            "The query of marriage. A fissure in the bedrock of our societal edifice. I find myself pondering this issue, torn asunder by the conflicting tides of reason and sentiment. As I sit in the desolate silence, the ash-strewn landscape stretching out before me like a funereal shroud, I am drawn to the notion that the manner in which one is born is not a choice, but a cold, unforgiving fact. Like the wind that howls through the barren trees, it is a force beyond our control, a primal urge that cannot be tempered by human will.\n\nIn this bleak and unforgiving world, I believe it is our duty to acknowledge and respect the intrinsic nature of those around us. To hold individuals accountable for their orientation is to impose a moral judgment, a notion that seems as futile as attempting to stem the tide of a raging river. The fluidity of existence is a mystery that defies our understanding, and to try to impose our own morality upon it is to risk being consumed by its turbulent depths.\n\nThe federal government, with its heavy hand and broad brush, seems an ill-equipped arbiter of this issue. Their involvement is a clumsy intrusion, a clumsy attempt to impose order on a chaos that resists our comprehension. It is a question of personal liberty, not national security or moral rectitude, and thus falls outside the purview of their authority.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of basic humanity. To deny individuals their right to love and be loved, to be who they are without fear of reprisal or condemnation, is to deny the very essence of our shared experience. And so, like the wind that blows through the desolate landscape, I am drawn to the notion that this is a matter of simple decency, a fundamental aspect of our shared humanity that cannot be legislated or regulated away.",
            "In this desolate expanse of our world, where the crumbling edifices of morality stand as hollow testaments to the transience of values, the question of gay marriage lingers, a festering wound that refuses to heal. It is a debate that has been reduced to a cacophony of sound bites, a jumbled mess of half-truths and misconceptions, where the voices of reason are drowned out by the din of ignorance.\n\nBut amidst this chaos, a glimmer of sense can be found. It is a simple truth, one that has been lost in the mire of fear and prejudice: that love knows no bounds, neither those of sex nor those of creed. It is a force that transcends the petty squabbles of humanity, a flame that burns bright and true, unencumbered by the shackles of societal expectation.\n\nThe arguments against gay marriage are legion, a litany of half-baked excuses and crackpot theories, each one a feeble attempt to justify the unjustifiable. The notion that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family is nothing but a red herring, a canard perpetuated by those who would seek to maintain their grip on power. It is a tired, threadbare argument, one that has been disproven time and time again by the simple fact of existence.\n\nAnd yet, it persists. Like a festering wound, it refuses to heal, a constant reminder of the dark underbelly of human nature. But it is a wound that can be healed, one that can be cauterized by the simple act of compassion and understanding.\n\nThe scientific studies are clear: gay couples are just as capable of sustained, fulfilling relationships as their heterosexual counterparts. They share the same hopes, the same dreams, the same fears. They are not somehow inherently different, nor are they somehow lesser. They are human beings, just as we are, with all the frailties and vulnerabilities that come with it.\n\nAnd yet, the debate rages on, fueled by the passions of the ignorant and the bigoted. It is a debate that has nothing to do with the rights of individuals, but rather with the power of the state to dictate what is and is not acceptable. It is a debate that has been hijacked by the zealots, who would seek to impose their will on the rest of us.\n\nBut it is a futile effort, one that will ultimately be doomed to failure. For the truth will out, no matter how hard we try to bury it. The fact is that gay marriage is not about the rights of the individual, but about the fundamental human right to love and be loved in return. It is about the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of their creed, their color, or their orientation.\n\nAnd so, as we stumble through this dark world, as we navigate the minefield of morality and ethics, we must remember this simple truth: that love is the one constant that binds us all together. It is the one thing that can transcend the petty squabbles of humanity, that can bring us together in a shared humanity.\n\nIn the end, it is not about the politics of it all, nor is it about the religious fervor that drives so many to oppose it. It is about the simple, human need to love and be loved. It is about the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of who they are or who they love.\n\nIn this desolate expanse of our world, where the crumbling edifices of morality stand as hollow testaments to the transience of values, this is the one thing that remains constant: the human heart, beating with a love that knows no bounds.",
            "The pharmacy I work at during the summer months is a place where the boundaries between life and death are blurred. It's a place where the very fabric of existence is stretched thin, where the threads of hope and despair are intertwined. I've seen it time and time again - the desperation in the eyes of those who come seeking solace in the pills and potions we dispense. But it's a double-edged sword, one that cuts both ways. For every life it saves, it takes another. The line between benefit and harm is a thin one, and it's a line that's often crossed.\n\nThe illegal nature of a drug, I've come to realize, is no guarantee of its inherent value. There are many substances, like oxycodone and Vicodin, that are forbidden yet still find their way into our pharmacy. We use them because they possess certain... let's call them \"properties\" that make them beneficial to our patients. But what of marijuana, that most vilified of substances? Is it not worthy of the same consideration?\n\nThe parallels between marijuana and alcohol are often drawn, but they're a false one. Both can be abused, yes, but the latter is a poison that ravages the soul as much as the body. Marijuana, on the other hand, is a substance that can be harnessed, its benefits realized with restraint. The key, I firmly believe, lies in education and understanding. If we can peel away the stigma, the taboo that surrounds it, perhaps we can unlock its true potential.\n\nBut how do we do this? By embracing it wholeheartedly, without reservation? I think not. No, the path forward lies in gradual integration, a measured approach that balances the desire for freedom with the need for responsibility. Remove the shackles of prohibition, and we risk unleashing a torrent of abuse. But by allowing it, in measured doses, we may yet find a way to harness its benefits.\n\nThe images that surround marijuana are distorted, a caricature of the truth. It's not the devil's weed, as some would have you believe, but a plant with its own unique properties and potential. And it's precisely this potential that we should be exploring, not demonizing. For in the end, it's not the substance itself that's the problem, but our own perceptions of it.",
            "The church, a monument to the shifting tides of time, has surrendered to the whims of the twenty-first century. Its once-imposing façade now yields to the casualities of modernity. Gone are the days of strict adherence to tradition; the hushed tones of reverence give way to the murmur of the mundane. I recall Sundays spent in the pews of my youth, the ritual of dressing in my best attire a testament to the gravity of the occasion. My mother would fuss over my outfit, ensuring that I was presented to the world with the dignity befitting a child of the Lord. The private school I attended added to the sense of formality, where on weekends I would reunite with friends clad in our finest Sunday finery.\n\nBut times change, and the church has adapted, its services shrinking to a mere thirty minutes, a concession to the fleeting nature of attention spans. The summer months bring an influx of beachwear, a far cry from the starched collars and high-button shoes of yesteryear. Even the morning masses, once a bastion of tradition, have given way to the informality of jeans and khakis. It is a sea change, one that I neither condone nor lament, merely acknowledge.\n\nAs for the issue of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I believe it is a canker that cannot be excised by a simple change in policy. The institution has been beset by scandal, and it is a tragedy that these atrocities could have been perpetrated under the very roof of the Lord. Some might suggest that allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry could have mitigated these instances, but I fear it is a chimera. Pedophilia is a fundamental aspect of human nature, a flaw that cannot be rectified by the mere trappings of societal norms.\n\nI recall a television show, Seventh Heaven, where a reverend was depicted as a married man of the cloth. It seemed a quaint notion, a far cry from the strictures of the Catholic Church. But even in that context, the reverend's marital status did not preclude him from his duties as a spiritual leader. It is a distinction without a difference; the underlying impulse remains the same.\n\nI believe that pedophilia is an inescapable aspect of human biology, a product of genetics rather than environment. It is a notion that cannot be altered by the trappings of social convention. The church, in all its forms, must confront this reality head-on, acknowledging the darkness that lurks within its midst. To pretend otherwise is to court disaster.\n\nAs I ponder the Catholic Church, I am left with a sense of sorrow and disillusionment. The institution has failed in its duty to protect the most vulnerable, and for that, it will forever bear the stain of shame. But I do not believe that it is a matter of policy or procedure; it is a fundamental failing of humanity itself.",
            "The embers of a once burning fire had long since dwindled to cold ash, and the embers of truth were no less extinguished. The precipice from which we leapt into the chasm of Iraq was shrouded in a mist of deceit, its precipitating factor the aftermath of September 11th. The administration's glib supposition, that the war was a direct response to the attacks, had been a mere pretext, a paltry attempt to obscure the true intent.\n\nA certain duplicity had become a defining characteristic of the Bush administration, their penchant for deception having left a trail of ruin in its wake. The specter of malfeasance hung heavy, as the very fabric of our democracy was strained to its breaking point. Even the stalwart Colin Powell, now an apostate from the fold, had publicly confessed to harboring doubts regarding the veracity of the evidence presented at the UN.\n\nThe Constitution, that sacred document upon which our nation was founded, was wilfully disregarded, its principles and protections callously cast aside. The administration's actions were a betrayal of the very oath they had sworn to uphold, an affront to the concept of truth and accountability. It was a brazen attempt to supplant the rule of law with the rule of whim, a reckless disregard for the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe instrumentalities of power, wielded by an administration hell-bent on self-aggrandizement, had been used to further their own interests, rather than the interests of the nation they claimed to serve. The specter of a 'blood vengeance' against Saddam Hussein loomed large, a vendetta born of the past, and a hunger for power that would stop at nothing.\n\nThe war, a catastrophic and misguided endeavor, had dragged on for far too long, its costs in blood and treasure incalculable. The prospect of withdrawal was fraught with peril, the very real possibility of civil war and further bloodshed hanging in the balance. The nascent government, a fragile and ephemeral thing, teetered on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty hanging precariously in the balance.\n\nA coalition of surrounding nations, a Faustian bargain, was touted as the solution, a panacea for the ills that had been wrought. But this would only serve to sow the seeds of future discord, as the very notion of Iraqi sovereignty was cast aside, and the nation was plunged into further chaos.\n\nIn the midst of this maelstrom, the once-promising interim government was reduced to a mere shell of its former self, a hollow husk devoid of authority or direction. The Parliament, a shadow of its former self, was riven by factional squabbles, its effectiveness nonexistent. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, wielded little real power, as the radical elements, still vying for control, continued to sow discord and instability.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves lost in a wilderness of confusion, our national discourse reduced to a cacophony of sound and fury, signifying nothing. The truth, that most elusive of commodities, had been lost in the maelstrom, leaving us to pick up the pieces of a shattered nation, and to wonder if redemption was even possible.",
            "In the hollow of his chest, a faint murmur stirred. He strained to think of the war in Iraq, to grasp the threads of his thoughts and weave them into a coherent tapestry. The silence was oppressive, a weight that pressed upon his mind like the ashes that shrouded the land. He sought to speak, to articulate the turmoil that churned within him, but the words refused to come.\n\nHe began, haltingly, his voice a tentative whisper. It feels pointless, he said, this war that raged across the desert sands. No declaration, no formal call to arms, just a maelstrom of blood and fire that consumed all in its path. And for what? To impose our will upon a people, to force upon them a democracy that would be nothing more than a pale imitation of our own? The thought was galling, a bitter taste that soured his mouth.\n\nBut then, too, he thought of the families, the sons and daughters who had been torn from their homes, sent to fight in a war that seemed without purpose. And the people of Iraq, their lives shattered, their cities reduced to rubble. He felt a pang of guilt, a sense of responsibility for the destruction that had been wrought.\n\nAnd yet, he couldn't shake the feeling that we were meddling, imposing our values upon a culture that was not our own. The Al-Kaida threat loomed, a specter that seemed to grow more menacing with each passing day. The more we stayed, the more we risked being drawn into a quagmire, a never-ending cycle of violence and hate.\n\nHe trailed off, his thoughts consumed by the silence. The ash swirled around him, a reminders of the desolation that had been wrought. He felt lost, adrift in a world that seemed to be spinning out of control.\n\nIn the end, he couldn't say what he thought, couldn't find the words to articulate the turmoil that churned within him. He simply sat, lost in the darkness, the ash falling around him like a shroud. [END]",
            "The notion of government intervention in matters of faith strains against the worn fabric of our nation's founding principles. The constitution's clause of separation of church and state stands as a bulwark against the entanglement of the two, safeguarding the freedom of conscience that has come to define us. It's a notion, stark and clear, that the government should not usurp the authority of the churches, but rather allow them to chart their own course.\n\nTo attempt to codify a ban on certain practices, to wield the power of the state against the churches, would be an affront to the very foundation of our democracy. It would be a declaration that one faith's conviction trumps the convictions of another, a notion abhorrent to the tolerant spirit that has long defined our nation.\n\nThe constitution, that revered and oft-repeated text, is a clarion call to the virtues of freedom and the free exercise of conscience. To amend it now, to impose a restriction on the people, would be a perversion of its intent. It would be an amendment born of expediency, not principle, and would serve only to restrict the very people it purports to protect.\n\nThe government's role is not to dictate the terms of faith, but to safeguard the rights of all its citizens to worship as they see fit. The president's push for such an amendment reeks of a bias, a preference for one faith over another. It is a move born of personal conviction, not a desire to serve the greater good.\n\nThe economy, the society, the very fabric of our nation would be better served by leaving the churches to their own devices. For it is in the free exercise of faith, unimpeded by the heavy hand of government, that we find true strength and resilience. The notion that such an amendment would somehow boost the economy or improve society is a tenuous at best, and one that does little to justify the infringement on the rights of the people.\n\nIn the end, it is the churches that must be left to decide their own course, unfettered by the dictates of the state. Anything less would be an affront to the very principles that have come to define us as a nation.",
            "In the desolate landscape of our time, the war in Iraq lies like a festering wound, a scar that refuses to heal. The memories of September 11th, 2001, still linger in the air, a palpable fog that shrouds the truth. The government, a behemoth with a penchant for deception, sought to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks, exploiting the collective grief of the American people. But the connection was tenuous at best, a flimsy thread that snapped beneath the weight of reality.\n\nAs the years went by, the war in Iraq unfolded like a macabre dance, a repetition of the same mistakes made in Vietnam. The government, once again, failed to learn from its past blunders, blind to the consequences of its actions. The soldiers, the brave men and women who fought and died, were mere pawns in a game of power and politics.\n\nTheir deaths, countless and senseless, a grim reminder of the government's hubris. The removal of the Iraqi government, a catastrophic event that left a power vacuum, a chasm that the US was ill-prepared to fill. The aftermath, a maelstrom of chaos and violence, a testament to the government's shortsightedness.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a war that should never have been, a war that was fought on false pretenses. The search for weapons of mass destruction, a mirage that vanished upon closer inspection. The real reason, the true motivation, the lust for oil, a hidden truth that only the most perceptive can see.\n\nAs the years drag on, the casualties mount, the American people are left to wonder: is it worth it? The cost, the human toll, the shattered lives, the families torn apart. The war, a quagmire that seems to have no end, a never-ending cycle of blood and steel.\n\nWe, the people, are left to pick up the pieces, to try to make sense of the madness that has been unleashed. We are naive to believe that democracy can be imposed, that it can be forced upon a people who have not asked for it. We are naive to think that the government will always act with truth and integrity.\n\nIn the end, it is not the war that is the problem, but the lies that led to it, the deceit that shrouds our government, the corruption that permeates our institutions. The war in Iraq is a symptom of a larger disease, a disease that infects us all, a disease of greed, of power, of control.\n\nLet us hope that one day, we will learn from our mistakes, that we will find the courage to confront the truth, to face the darkness that lies within ourselves. Let us hope that the war in Iraq will be a lesson, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power, of the importance of truth and integrity. But until then, we are left to suffer the consequences of our actions, to wander in the desolate landscape of our own making.",
            "The thing is, I don't believe in the constraints of others. I've always thought that love is love, regardless of the specifics. It's personal, a string that binds two souls together. And what's the nature of that string, anyway? Is it something we're born with, a thread of DNA that weaves through our very being? Or is it something we cultivate, a garden of emotions that grow and flourish with time? I think it's a mix of both, a dance of fate and choice.\n\nI've seen it in my own life, the way people live, the way they love. My neighbors, good people, two men living together, just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they tend their garden, they love each other just as any other couple would. And what business is it of mine, or anyone else's, to say otherwise? The President, with his interpretations and his moralities, trying to tell us what marriage means. It's a farce, a charade, a mockery of the very concept.\n\nI've read the studies, the research, the statistics. It's not just a matter of choice, not just a matter of upbringing. There's something biological at play, a chemical whisper in the brain that guides us. And what's wrong with that? Is it not the same as a preference for the color blue or the taste of strawberries? Why should we deny people their fundamental right to love, just because it doesn't fit our narrow definitions?\n\nAnd what of the rest of us, the ones who are comfortable in our own skin, who don't need the validation of society to define our relationships? Shouldn't we be free to live our lives as we see fit, without the weight of others' judgment? Marriage, in the end, is a personal thing, a private contract between two people. It's not for the government to dictate, not for the media to sensationalize. It's a matter of love, of commitment, of two people choosing to spend their lives together.\n\nSo, I say, let us not concern ourselves with the specifics. Let us not try to define what love looks like, what it feels like. Let us simply allow people to be, to love as they choose, without fear of reprisal or rejection. It's a basic human right, after all, and one that we should be proud to defend.",
            "In the vast and unyielding expanse of the digital realm, a singular truth holds sway: once set loose, the words of a man can become the wind that rustles the leaves of countless minds. This is a reality that I have come to know all too well in my role as a resident advisor, where the delicate balance between freedom and responsibility is ever-shifting. When words are breathed into the ether of the internet, they assume a life of their own, unbound by the constraints of time and space. In this boundless expanse, the distinction between jest and earnest intent becomes increasingly tenuous, and the lines between public and private blur like the edges of a forgotten photograph.\n\nAs I've witnessed firsthand, the careless utterance can spark a maelstrom of consequences, as the whispers of a single individual can fan the flames of anxiety and concern among those who would listen. The notion that one's words might be overheard, misinterpreted, or misconstrued by a stranger is a specter that haunts us all, a constant reminder that our thoughts and sentiments are never truly our own once they've been set free.\n\nThe ease with which information can be disseminated, shared, and scrutinized has created a world where one's digital footprint can be traversed at will, stripped bare of its context and reduced to a series of isolated words, each one a potential detonator waiting to ignite the powder keg of public opinion. And in this precarious landscape, the notion of privacy becomes a mirage, a fleeting dream that vanishes upon closer inspection.\n\nIn this regard, the actions of school officials who monitor the digital lives of their students can be seen as both a necessary evil and a brazen invasion of personal space. While it is true that the creation of social media accounts under a pseudonym or the friending of students on Myspace or Facebook can be seen as a delicate balancing act, it is also a reality that the world will not be bound by the confines of a school's walls. When concerns are brought to light, they must be addressed, lest the consequences of inaction prove catastrophic.\n\nIn the end, it is not the act of monitoring itself that is the issue, but rather the manner in which it is executed. The lines between guidance and surveillance are often blurred, leaving one to wonder: where does concern end and intrusion begin? As a resident advisor, I have come to realize that the answer lies not in the act of monitoring itself, but in the context in which it is applied. The delicate dance between freedom and responsibility is a tightrope that must be walked with care, lest the consequences of a misstep prove disastrous.",
            "The war, a drawn-out odyssey besmirched by time. Its purpose, once a beacon of hope, now lost to the murk of ambiguity. We were to be the liberators, the bringers of democracy to a people shackled by tyranny. But the days have turned to years, and the years to an endless expanse of desolation. Our actions, no longer driven by the pure intention of freedom, have been sullied by the stain of self-interest.\n\nWe speak of restoring democracy, but what of the motives that led us down this treacherous path? Were they not tainted by the complexities of power and the personal vendettas of the past? George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, their animosity a festering wound that refused to heal. And so we found ourselves entangled in a quagmire, our purpose diluted by the weight of our own ambitions.\n\nIn the beginning, we made a statement, a declaration of our intent to bring light to a world shrouded in darkness. But time has worn away at our resolve, and we are now mired in the quicksand of indecision. We yearn for a decisive victory, a triumphant end to this conflict, but the truth is, our purpose has been lost to the sands of time.\n\nWe spend billions upon billions, draining our own economy, as our own people suffer. We pour our treasure into a war that has long since lost its justification. The people of the country we sought to liberate are left to fend for themselves, while we squander our resources on a conflict that has become a hollow shell of its former self.\n\nWar is not a luxury we can afford, not in a world where poverty and neglect cry out for attention. We have our own wounds to heal, our own battles to fight. The money we spend on this war could be better spent on schools, on roads, on healthcare, on the very fabric of our own society. And so we are left to ponder the cost of our actions, to wonder if the ends justify the means, and to pray that one day we will find our way back to the purpose that once drove us.\n\nWe are not the liberators we once claimed to be, but rather the perpetrators of a conflict that has lost its way. Our actions, no longer guided by the pure intention of freedom, have become a mere exercise in futility, a testament to the destructive power of human ambition. And so we are left to wonder, what have we accomplished, and at what cost?",
            "The notion that one's life might be saved by the prying eyes of a stranger on the internet, it's a notion that hangs like a specter over the landscape of our modern existence. A specter born of the whispers and warnings that echo through the digital halls, a cautionary tale of the perils that lurk in the shadows of the online world.\n\nIn the virtual realm, we surrender a portion of our lives to the void, allowing the gaze of others to fall upon us like a cold, unforgiving wind. We post and share, we reveal and conceal, all under the guise of convenience and connection. But in doing so, we also invite the unwanted gaze of strangers, their eyes upon us like a chill in the darkness.\n\nConsider the example of Myspace, a platform where one's profile can be accessed by anyone who knows the password, a password shared with friends and acquaintances, a password that grants permission to those who would seek to intrude upon our private lives. And yet, even with such safeguards in place, the boundaries between public and private begin to blur, the lines between consent and invasion growing increasingly indistinct.\n\nIt's a difficult balance to strike, one that weighs the need for connection against the fear of exposure. We yearn for the intimacy of the online world, the ease of communication and the sense of community it provides. And yet, we also fear the prying eyes that lurk in the shadows, the strangers who would seek to exploit our vulnerabilities and manipulate our trust.\n\nThe question remains, is it an invasion of privacy to monitor an individual's online activity, to scour their profile for signs of danger or deceit? Or is it a necessary measure, a means of protecting the vulnerable from those who would seek to harm them? The answer, much like the digital landscape itself, is shrouded in uncertainty, a labyrinth of gray areas and conflicting perspectives.\n\nAs one who has traversed this digital expanse, I can attest to the treacherous nature of online interactions. The ease with which strangers can access our personal information, the ways in which they can manipulate and deceive. It's a world where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are constantly shifting, where the lines between consent and coercion are repeatedly blurred.\n\nAnd yet, even with these risks in mind, I still find myself drawn to the online world, a world that offers a sense of connection and community that is hard to find elsewhere. It's a double-edged sword, one that cuts both ways, offering the promise of intimacy and the threat of invasion.\n\nIn the end, it's a delicate balance, one that requires a constant negotiation between the need for connection and the fear of exposure. A balance that is as fragile as the digital threads that bind us together, as ephemeral as the whispers that echo through the online halls.",
            "In the bleak expanse of a forgotten landscape, the echoes of war linger. The Iraq War, a calamity of grand proportions, casts a long shadow over the world. It was a disaster from its inception, a calamity born of hubris and blind ambition. The consensus was clear: the invasion was a bad idea, a folly that would only lead to more suffering and chaos.\n\nPolls from across the globe bear witness to this fact. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population views the war as a catastrophic mistake. The Iraqi people, the very ones we sought to liberate, now overwhelmingly demand our departure. Even the soldiers who fought in the conflict, a staggering seventy percent, believe the war was a grave error, and that we should extricate ourselves within the year.\n\nYet, like the ghostly apparitions that haunt the ruins of a forgotten city, the war's remnants cling to life. A culture clash of epic proportions has taken hold, a chasm so vast that it defies comprehension. The United States, with its vaunted ideals of democracy, has attempted to impose its will upon a people who would rather chart their own course. The result has been a quagmire, a quagmire of endless suffering and bloodshed.\n\nThe administration's justification for remaining in Iraq is a tangle of half-truths and unconvincing arguments. They speak of stability and security, but these are mere shibboleths, empty words that ring hollow in the face of reality. The people of Iraq have spoken, and their voices are clear: leave us be.\n\nIf we continue to occupy their land, we risk perpetuating the very cycle of violence and chaos we sought to eradicate. The statistics are stark: eighty percent of Iraqis demand our departure within the year, and a quarter of them urge us to leave immediately. These are the people we claim to be liberating, the people we claim to be saving. Do we not listen to their pleas?\n\nPerhaps it is time to acknowledge that our presence in Iraq has been a disaster, a calamity that will only continue to unfold if we remain. We have been told that we are the good guys, that we are the bringers of democracy and freedom. But the truth is more nuanced, more complicated. We are a power, a force that has imposed its will upon a people who would rather live under their own terms.\n\nThe time has come to extricate ourselves from this quagmire. We must listen to the voices of the Iraqi people, to the soldiers who have fought and bled for a cause that has lost all sense. We must acknowledge the reality of our failure, and begin the long and arduous process of withdrawal.\n\nFor in the end, it is not our presence that has brought stability to Iraq, but rather our absence. It is our departure that will allow the Iraqi people to chart their own course, to forge their own destiny. Only then can we hope to redeem ourselves, to find a glimmer of redemption in the ashes of our failure.",
            "In a land ravaged by the fetid breath of prejudice, where the stench of inequality clings to every surface, the specter of gender bias haunts the streets of America. It is a cancer, festering in the marrow of society, its tendrils snaking into every crevice of the workaday world. The glass ceiling, that supposedly transparent barrier, still bars the way for women, who toil in the shadows, their talents and abilities obscured by the weight of a millennia-old narrative.\n\nIn the rarefied realm of corporate power, the boardroom elite often prove unwilling to promote women to positions of authority, their decisions guided by a historically entrenched bias that views the feminine as inferior. And yet, this is not a one-way street; men too, in certain industries, are subject to the whims of societal expectation. In the rarefied world of fashion, for instance, a man's interest in the field is often met with skepticism, as if his very masculinity is somehow suspect. His involvement is seen as a novelty, a fleeting aberration from the norm.\n\nIn the domestic sphere, the traditional division of labor often renders stay-at-home fathers vulnerable to ridicule and scorn. The societal expectation that men must be breadwinners, providers, is a heavy burden to bear, and one that can weigh heavily on the male half of the equation. Why, the critics ask, would a man choose to abandon his masculine duties and devote himself to childcare? The answer, of course, is that he may simply wish to be present, to nurture and guide his children as they grow and develop. But this is a notion that society has yet to fully grasp.\n\nAs we navigate the labyrinthine corridors of progress, it becomes clear that change is a slow and arduous process. The needle of equality has moved, incrementally, over the years, but there is still much work to be done. Women have made strides in the corporate world, taking on leadership roles and shattering glass ceilings. But the journey is far from over. Men, too, are beginning to re-evaluate their roles, questioning the traditional expectations placed upon them.\n\nIn this delicate dance of social evolution, it is crucial that we tread carefully, lest we risk alienating those we seek to persuade. To boldly push for change can be counterproductive, often triggering resistance in those who feel threatened by the status quo. Instead, we must strive to highlight the qualities that make individuals exceptional, regardless of their background or biology. By celebrating the unique strengths and talents of those who defy societal norms, we can create a more inclusive, more compassionate world.\n\nIn this fragile balance, we find ourselves at a crossroads. The road ahead is long, winding, and fraught with obstacles. But it is a journey we must undertake, for the sake of our collective humanity. By acknowledging the many faces of discrimination, we can begin to chip away at the edifice of prejudice, one small step at a time. And though the progress may be slow, it is a journey worth taking, for in the end, it is only by embracing our differences that we may truly find common ground.",
            "The laws changed, a shift in the current. Decriminalization, they called it. The weight of the law, no longer crushing. The man's hands, freed from the chains of oppression, now grasped the reins of reason. It was no longer a felony, but a mere infraction, a speed ticket to be dealt with and forgotten. The people worried about the consequences, the stains on their records, the whispers of disapproval. But the cost of arrest, of prosecution, of incarceration, a heavy burden, one that could be lifted. The municipalities, struggling to stay afloat, saw the sense in it. The city of Denver, a bastion of progress, a place where the wind of change blew strong, where the people were open-minded, where the chains of tradition were shed. And so they moved forward, leaving behind the shackles of the past.\n\nBut the debate raged on, a tempest in a teapot. Some said it was a slippery slope, a Pandora's box that would unleash a torrent of chaos upon the land. The streets would be choked with the stench of smoke, the air thick with the haze of euphoria. The motor skills of the drivers would falter, the roads a battleground of accidents and mayhem. And the society, already fragile, would crumble under the weight of this new freedom.\n\nBut others saw it differently, a glass half full, a cup overflowing with possibilities. The money, once spent on the war on drugs, could be poured into the streams of education, of social programs, of food for the hungry. The people, once imprisoned, could be free, their minds unshackled, their creativity unbridled. And the city, once a wasteland of despair, could bloom, a garden of hope and opportunity.\n\nI myself am torn, a ship tossed on the waves of doubt. I see the arguments on both sides, the pros and cons, the for and against. But as I stand on the shore, looking out at the sea of uncertainty, I am drawn to the tide of progress. The future, like the horizon, stretches out before us, a vast expanse of possibility. And I believe that we must move forward, into the unknown, with hope in our hearts and the wind at our backs.",
            "In the hush of reflection, I find myself standing at the precipice of tradition. The echoes of the past reverberate, reminding me that many of the actions we undertake are rooted in a bygone era. Like the worn grooves of a well-traveled path, these customs have been etched into our collective psyche, their familiarity a comforting certainty. Yet, it is equally essential to acknowledge the necessity of adaptability, to bend with the winds of change like a withered branch yielding to the tempest.\n\nIn the Catholic faith, tradition is a sacred trust, a set of dogma handed down through the ages. The expectation is clear: attend Mass each Sunday, adhere to the doctrine, and be judged by the strictest of standards. But beneath the surface, a discordant note resonates – a dissonance born of contradiction. For while the Church preaches love and acceptance, its practices often falter, excluding those who do not conform, those whose devotion is deemed imperfect.\n\nMy own family's story is a testament to this paradox. My parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian, were barred from marrying in the Catholic Church due to my father's denomination. The harsh judgment of the Church's rigid expectations left a bitter taste, a reminder that its teachings often fall short of its ideals. The lesson learned was clear: the pursuit of love and acceptance is often at odds with the strictures of tradition.\n\nAs I ponder the role of priests, I am drawn to the question of their marital status. Permitting them to marry might alleviate some of the suffering that has plagued the Church, but would it truly prevent the aberrant behavior of those who would harm children? I fear not, for the corruption of the heart is a burden that cannot be easily lifted. The pedophilic tendencies of some may be a manifestation of deeper, more complex issues, and marriage, or the lack thereof, is merely a symptom, not a cause.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that holds the key to redemption, but rather a fundamental shift in values, a recognition that love and acceptance know no bounds, that the dignity of every soul is paramount. The Church's adherence to tradition, while comforting to some, must not come at the expense of its most vulnerable members. As I reflect on this complex web of doctrine and practice, I am left with a sense of unease, a feeling that the Church's rigid stance on marriage and family is a mere facade, a veil that conceals the true depths of its convictions.",
            "The mire of this conundrum has left me lost in its stagnant waters. The weight of the question presses upon me like a physical force, an unseen hand that pinches at the joints of my mind. Separation of church and state, a delicate balance that teeters on the precipice of offense, a tremulous dance between the sacred and the secular. And at the heart of it all, the sacrament of marriage, a bond forged in the fire of devotion, a union of flesh and soul. Can it be reduced to a civil contract, a mere trifle of state recognition? Must the government's gaze be turned away, refusing to sully its eyes with the intimate details of love?\n\nI am torn, a leaf caught in the whirlpool of opposing currents. The idea of marriage as a civil union seems a paltry thing, a shallow imitation of the true bond that exists between two souls. And yet, can the state truly be expected to recognize the sacrament, to confer upon it a status that transcends the mundane? The impulse to separate church and state, to keep the sacred and the profane apart, is a noble one. But does it not risk reducing the human experience to a mere cipher, a series of sterile abstractions?\n\nThe notion of gay marriage stirs up a tempest within me, a maelstrom of conflicting emotions. Is it not a union of two people, a bond that should be recognized and respected, regardless of the trappings of tradition or convention? And yet, can it be said that this union is the same as that of any other couple, that the government's recognition of it would not somehow sully the very fabric of society?\n\nThe call for a federal law, a logical conclusion arrived at through the aggregation of state opinions, seems a palatable solution. But a constitutional amendment, a sweeping change to the foundation of our society, seems an overreach, a reaction born of passion rather than reason. To amend the constitution for this cause alone seems a gross overstatement, a recognition of the importance of this issue that I do not share.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, lost in the mire of this conundrum. The question of gay marriage, like the question of the separation of church and state, is a complex and multifaceted one, a Gordian knot that resists easy solution. I can offer no clear answer, only the murmur of doubts and uncertainties that haunt me like a specter.",
            "I grew up in a household where faith was a guiding force, and as such, I've grappled with the concept of homosexuality in a manner both introspective and ambivalent. My relationships with individuals who identify as gay have fostered a certain familiarity, yet I've come to realize that my own stance on the matter is complex and multifaceted. I do not entirely condone the lifestyle, but I firmly believe that it should be a decision left to the discretion of each individual state, rather than a federal mandate.\n\nI understand that our nation is comprised of diverse states, each with their own unique values and ideologies. Democratic states, for instance, tend to lean more progressive on issues such as gay marriage. Were one to reside in a state that has chosen to legalize gay marriage, I believe it would be prudent to respect their decision, for it is a choice one makes by residing within that state's borders.\n\nMy stance is not that homosexuality should be universally accepted or condemned; rather, I believe that individuals should be afforded the same opportunities and rights as their heterosexual counterparts. Therefore, the decision to legalize gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state, allowing them to govern their own affairs without undue federal interference.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the president's views on the matter should not supersede the will of individual states. The notion that President Bush's stance on gay marriage should dictate a nationwide policy seems misguided, as he represents but one aspect of our federal government. Ultimately, it is the states themselves that must live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president. Thus, I firmly believe that each state should have the autonomy to decide its own stance on gay marriage, free from federal overreach.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not support a blanket nationwide ban on gay marriage. Instead, I advocate for a system where individual states are empowered to make their own decisions, allowing for a more nuanced and diverse approach to this complex issue.",
            "The notion that posting on Myspace is a public thing is a notion that I do not at all subscribe to. I suppose it's a notion that's been drummed into our collective consciousness - that anything one posts on the internet is fair game for anyone to see. But that's not entirely true.\n\nWhen one posts something on the internet, whether it be a bulletin or a simple message, that action is not without consequence. It's akin to shouting one's innermost thoughts from the mountaintop - anything that escapes the confines of the digital realm can be seen and heard by anyone who dares to listen.\n\nAnd it's precisely this notion that I think the school officials had a right to consider when they accessed my Myspace profile. Even if I wasn't posting under the school's name, the fact remains that they could have accessed it from their homes, and that's a distinction without a difference. The fact that they were keeping a watchful eye on their students' online activities is not an invasion of privacy, but rather a necessary measure to ensure the safety of those in their care.\n\nI recall a conversation I had with a teacher of mine at my public high school, in which we discussed the necessity of monitoring students' online activities. We talked about how lock downs and drills were put in place to prepare for the unthinkable, and how those measures were a direct response to the fear of terrorist attacks and school shootings. I see the school officials' actions as an extension of that same logic - a proactive measure to prevent anything bad from happening.\n\nThe fact that I may have posted something on Myspace that I didn't intend for school officials to see is beside the point. The truth is, once something is on the internet, it's always there, waiting to be discovered. And I'd be foolish to think that my words wouldn't have consequences. It's a risk we all take when we post online, and it's one that I'm not naive enough to ignore.\n\nIn the end, I think the school officials' actions were justified. If it means keeping students safe, then I'm all for it. And that's what I've been trying to say all along - it's a public thing, and we should be aware of the consequences of our actions.",
            "The ghosts of war still linger within me, a specter born of the embers of nine eleven. It was a day that seared my soul, a day that laid bare the abyss that separates us from the chaos that festers beyond our borders. I recall the fervor that gripped me then, a zeal that blinded me to the ruin that would follow. We were a nation bent on vengeance, driven by a hunger for retribution that would only be satiated by the destruction of others. But in the aftermath, I came to see the folly of our endeavors. The flames of war had been fanned by emotions, not reason, and we marched forward with a zealot's fervor, unprepared for the devastation that would be wrought.\n\nIn the crucible of war, I witnessed the contradictions that have long defined our relationship with the world. We speak of progress, of freedom, of democracy, but our actions betray a grim reality: that we are a people bent on imposing our will upon others, rather than listening to their stories, their struggles, and their hopes. The people of Iraq, I came to realize, were not our enemies, but rather, they were us – flawed, imperfect, and torn asunder by our own making.\n\nWe delved into the heart of their world with a recklessness that bordered on savagery, our actions driven by a desire to reshape their destiny, rather than to understand their plight. And in the end, we created a void, a chasm that cannot be bridged. The war has left us with a legacy of blood and ash, a reminder that our power is not a panacea, but a poison that has seeped into the very fabric of their being.\n\nI have come to believe that we are not the saviors we pretend to be, but rather, we are the authors of our own undoing. Our presence has only served to embolden the very factions we sought to vanquish, and our departure will only hasten the collapse of a system that has been forever altered by our interference. We have sown the seeds of discord, and now we reap the whirlwind.\n\nIn the silence of the night, I am haunted by the voices of the dead, their whispers a reminder of the cost of our hubris. I am left to ponder the wisdom of our actions, to question the motives that drove us forward, and to wonder if we have been foolish to believe that we could impose our will upon the world. The ghosts of war still linger, a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that the price of our pride may be higher than we can bear."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In the stagnant air of dogma, the Catholic Church's rigidity seems to be calcifying its very foundation. Like a once-noble edifice worn down by the relentless passage of time, its views, once held aloft like a beacon, now appear antiquated and out of step with the world. The Church's inflexibility on matters such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control has become a barrier to its relevance, a stumbling block that is causing it to lose its hold on the faithful.\n\nThe winds of change are whispering through the corridors of history, and the Church's refusal to adapt is leaving it vulnerable to the tempests of dissent. The issue is not that the Church's views are without merit, but rather that they are seemingly frozen in a bygone era, unyielding to the currents of progress. By clinging to these outdated tenets, the Church risks losing its flock, its members drifting away like autumn leaves on a gusty day.\n\nIn an age of growing acceptance and understanding, the Church's stance on these issues seems increasingly out of sync. The result is a chasm between the faithful and those who would follow, a chasm that threatens to swallow the Church whole. The Church's rejection of abortion, for example, may be a catechism of old, but in a world where choices and opinions are increasingly nuanced, it can no longer be the sole arbiter of truth.\n\nThe notion that priests must remain celibate, that they are wedded to God alone, seems a relic of a bygone era. In a world where professionals and families coexist, where devotion and duty are not mutually exclusive, it is puzzling that the Church cannot see the value in allowing its priests to form meaningful connections with the world. The Church's stance on female priests, too, raises questions about its commitment to equality and justice. In a world where women are increasingly empowered, why should the Church lag behind?\n\nThe Church's inability to adapt has led to a crisis of faith, a sense of disillusionment that has left many questioning its relevance. Like a great oak whose branches have been pruned back, the Church risks becoming a hollow shell of its former self, a relic of a bygone era. It is time for the Church to reassess its stance on these issues, to find a middle ground that will allow it to reconnect with the world and reclaim its place as a beacon of hope and guidance.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, as the world outside recedes into the shadows, the Church must confront the darkness within. It is a darkness that threatens to consume it, to leave it a hollow husk of its former self. But it is also a darkness that holds the seed of redemption, a chance for the Church to rediscover its mission and its purpose. Let us hope that it will seize this opportunity, that it will find a way to heal the schisms and reconnect with the world.",
            "The query of marriage. A fissure in the bedrock of our societal edifice. I find myself pondering this issue, torn asunder by the conflicting tides of reason and sentiment. As I sit in the desolate silence, the ash-strewn landscape stretching out before me like a funereal shroud, I am drawn to the notion that the manner in which one is born is not a choice, but a cold, unforgiving fact. Like the wind that howls through the barren trees, it is a force beyond our control, a primal urge that cannot be tempered by human will.\n\nIn this bleak and unforgiving world, I believe it is our duty to acknowledge and respect the intrinsic nature of those around us. To hold individuals accountable for their orientation is to impose a moral judgment, a notion that seems as futile as attempting to stem the tide of a raging river. The fluidity of existence is a mystery that defies our understanding, and to try to impose our own morality upon it is to risk being consumed by its turbulent depths.\n\nThe federal government, with its heavy hand and broad brush, seems an ill-equipped arbiter of this issue. Their involvement is a clumsy intrusion, a clumsy attempt to impose order on a chaos that resists our comprehension. It is a question of personal liberty, not national security or moral rectitude, and thus falls outside the purview of their authority.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of basic humanity. To deny individuals their right to love and be loved, to be who they are without fear of reprisal or condemnation, is to deny the very essence of our shared experience. And so, like the wind that blows through the desolate landscape, I am drawn to the notion that this is a matter of simple decency, a fundamental aspect of our shared humanity that cannot be legislated or regulated away.",
            "In this desolate expanse of our world, where the crumbling edifices of morality stand as hollow testaments to the transience of values, the question of gay marriage lingers, a festering wound that refuses to heal. It is a debate that has been reduced to a cacophony of sound bites, a jumbled mess of half-truths and misconceptions, where the voices of reason are drowned out by the din of ignorance.\n\nBut amidst this chaos, a glimmer of sense can be found. It is a simple truth, one that has been lost in the mire of fear and prejudice: that love knows no bounds, neither those of sex nor those of creed. It is a force that transcends the petty squabbles of humanity, a flame that burns bright and true, unencumbered by the shackles of societal expectation.\n\nThe arguments against gay marriage are legion, a litany of half-baked excuses and crackpot theories, each one a feeble attempt to justify the unjustifiable. The notion that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family is nothing but a red herring, a canard perpetuated by those who would seek to maintain their grip on power. It is a tired, threadbare argument, one that has been disproven time and time again by the simple fact of existence.\n\nAnd yet, it persists. Like a festering wound, it refuses to heal, a constant reminder of the dark underbelly of human nature. But it is a wound that can be healed, one that can be cauterized by the simple act of compassion and understanding.\n\nThe scientific studies are clear: gay couples are just as capable of sustained, fulfilling relationships as their heterosexual counterparts. They share the same hopes, the same dreams, the same fears. They are not somehow inherently different, nor are they somehow lesser. They are human beings, just as we are, with all the frailties and vulnerabilities that come with it.\n\nAnd yet, the debate rages on, fueled by the passions of the ignorant and the bigoted. It is a debate that has nothing to do with the rights of individuals, but rather with the power of the state to dictate what is and is not acceptable. It is a debate that has been hijacked by the zealots, who would seek to impose their will on the rest of us.\n\nBut it is a futile effort, one that will ultimately be doomed to failure. For the truth will out, no matter how hard we try to bury it. The fact is that gay marriage is not about the rights of the individual, but about the fundamental human right to love and be loved in return. It is about the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of their creed, their color, or their orientation.\n\nAnd so, as we stumble through this dark world, as we navigate the minefield of morality and ethics, we must remember this simple truth: that love is the one constant that binds us all together. It is the one thing that can transcend the petty squabbles of humanity, that can bring us together in a shared humanity.\n\nIn the end, it is not about the politics of it all, nor is it about the religious fervor that drives so many to oppose it. It is about the simple, human need to love and be loved. It is about the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of who they are or who they love.\n\nIn this desolate expanse of our world, where the crumbling edifices of morality stand as hollow testaments to the transience of values, this is the one thing that remains constant: the human heart, beating with a love that knows no bounds.",
            "The pharmacy I work at during the summer months is a place where the boundaries between life and death are blurred. It's a place where the very fabric of existence is stretched thin, where the threads of hope and despair are intertwined. I've seen it time and time again - the desperation in the eyes of those who come seeking solace in the pills and potions we dispense. But it's a double-edged sword, one that cuts both ways. For every life it saves, it takes another. The line between benefit and harm is a thin one, and it's a line that's often crossed.\n\nThe illegal nature of a drug, I've come to realize, is no guarantee of its inherent value. There are many substances, like oxycodone and Vicodin, that are forbidden yet still find their way into our pharmacy. We use them because they possess certain... let's call them \"properties\" that make them beneficial to our patients. But what of marijuana, that most vilified of substances? Is it not worthy of the same consideration?\n\nThe parallels between marijuana and alcohol are often drawn, but they're a false one. Both can be abused, yes, but the latter is a poison that ravages the soul as much as the body. Marijuana, on the other hand, is a substance that can be harnessed, its benefits realized with restraint. The key, I firmly believe, lies in education and understanding. If we can peel away the stigma, the taboo that surrounds it, perhaps we can unlock its true potential.\n\nBut how do we do this? By embracing it wholeheartedly, without reservation? I think not. No, the path forward lies in gradual integration, a measured approach that balances the desire for freedom with the need for responsibility. Remove the shackles of prohibition, and we risk unleashing a torrent of abuse. But by allowing it, in measured doses, we may yet find a way to harness its benefits.\n\nThe images that surround marijuana are distorted, a caricature of the truth. It's not the devil's weed, as some would have you believe, but a plant with its own unique properties and potential. And it's precisely this potential that we should be exploring, not demonizing. For in the end, it's not the substance itself that's the problem, but our own perceptions of it.",
            "The church, a monument to the shifting tides of time, has surrendered to the whims of the twenty-first century. Its once-imposing façade now yields to the casualities of modernity. Gone are the days of strict adherence to tradition; the hushed tones of reverence give way to the murmur of the mundane. I recall Sundays spent in the pews of my youth, the ritual of dressing in my best attire a testament to the gravity of the occasion. My mother would fuss over my outfit, ensuring that I was presented to the world with the dignity befitting a child of the Lord. The private school I attended added to the sense of formality, where on weekends I would reunite with friends clad in our finest Sunday finery.\n\nBut times change, and the church has adapted, its services shrinking to a mere thirty minutes, a concession to the fleeting nature of attention spans. The summer months bring an influx of beachwear, a far cry from the starched collars and high-button shoes of yesteryear. Even the morning masses, once a bastion of tradition, have given way to the informality of jeans and khakis. It is a sea change, one that I neither condone nor lament, merely acknowledge.\n\nAs for the issue of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I believe it is a canker that cannot be excised by a simple change in policy. The institution has been beset by scandal, and it is a tragedy that these atrocities could have been perpetrated under the very roof of the Lord. Some might suggest that allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry could have mitigated these instances, but I fear it is a chimera. Pedophilia is a fundamental aspect of human nature, a flaw that cannot be rectified by the mere trappings of societal norms.\n\nI recall a television show, Seventh Heaven, where a reverend was depicted as a married man of the cloth. It seemed a quaint notion, a far cry from the strictures of the Catholic Church. But even in that context, the reverend's marital status did not preclude him from his duties as a spiritual leader. It is a distinction without a difference; the underlying impulse remains the same.\n\nI believe that pedophilia is an inescapable aspect of human biology, a product of genetics rather than environment. It is a notion that cannot be altered by the trappings of social convention. The church, in all its forms, must confront this reality head-on, acknowledging the darkness that lurks within its midst. To pretend otherwise is to court disaster.\n\nAs I ponder the Catholic Church, I am left with a sense of sorrow and disillusionment. The institution has failed in its duty to protect the most vulnerable, and for that, it will forever bear the stain of shame. But I do not believe that it is a matter of policy or procedure; it is a fundamental failing of humanity itself.",
            "The embers of a once burning fire had long since dwindled to cold ash, and the embers of truth were no less extinguished. The precipice from which we leapt into the chasm of Iraq was shrouded in a mist of deceit, its precipitating factor the aftermath of September 11th. The administration's glib supposition, that the war was a direct response to the attacks, had been a mere pretext, a paltry attempt to obscure the true intent.\n\nA certain duplicity had become a defining characteristic of the Bush administration, their penchant for deception having left a trail of ruin in its wake. The specter of malfeasance hung heavy, as the very fabric of our democracy was strained to its breaking point. Even the stalwart Colin Powell, now an apostate from the fold, had publicly confessed to harboring doubts regarding the veracity of the evidence presented at the UN.\n\nThe Constitution, that sacred document upon which our nation was founded, was wilfully disregarded, its principles and protections callously cast aside. The administration's actions were a betrayal of the very oath they had sworn to uphold, an affront to the concept of truth and accountability. It was a brazen attempt to supplant the rule of law with the rule of whim, a reckless disregard for the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe instrumentalities of power, wielded by an administration hell-bent on self-aggrandizement, had been used to further their own interests, rather than the interests of the nation they claimed to serve. The specter of a 'blood vengeance' against Saddam Hussein loomed large, a vendetta born of the past, and a hunger for power that would stop at nothing.\n\nThe war, a catastrophic and misguided endeavor, had dragged on for far too long, its costs in blood and treasure incalculable. The prospect of withdrawal was fraught with peril, the very real possibility of civil war and further bloodshed hanging in the balance. The nascent government, a fragile and ephemeral thing, teetered on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty hanging precariously in the balance.\n\nA coalition of surrounding nations, a Faustian bargain, was touted as the solution, a panacea for the ills that had been wrought. But this would only serve to sow the seeds of future discord, as the very notion of Iraqi sovereignty was cast aside, and the nation was plunged into further chaos.\n\nIn the midst of this maelstrom, the once-promising interim government was reduced to a mere shell of its former self, a hollow husk devoid of authority or direction. The Parliament, a shadow of its former self, was riven by factional squabbles, its effectiveness nonexistent. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, wielded little real power, as the radical elements, still vying for control, continued to sow discord and instability.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves lost in a wilderness of confusion, our national discourse reduced to a cacophony of sound and fury, signifying nothing. The truth, that most elusive of commodities, had been lost in the maelstrom, leaving us to pick up the pieces of a shattered nation, and to wonder if redemption was even possible.",
            "In the hollow of his chest, a faint murmur stirred. He strained to think of the war in Iraq, to grasp the threads of his thoughts and weave them into a coherent tapestry. The silence was oppressive, a weight that pressed upon his mind like the ashes that shrouded the land. He sought to speak, to articulate the turmoil that churned within him, but the words refused to come.\n\nHe began, haltingly, his voice a tentative whisper. It feels pointless, he said, this war that raged across the desert sands. No declaration, no formal call to arms, just a maelstrom of blood and fire that consumed all in its path. And for what? To impose our will upon a people, to force upon them a democracy that would be nothing more than a pale imitation of our own? The thought was galling, a bitter taste that soured his mouth.\n\nBut then, too, he thought of the families, the sons and daughters who had been torn from their homes, sent to fight in a war that seemed without purpose. And the people of Iraq, their lives shattered, their cities reduced to rubble. He felt a pang of guilt, a sense of responsibility for the destruction that had been wrought.\n\nAnd yet, he couldn't shake the feeling that we were meddling, imposing our values upon a culture that was not our own. The Al-Kaida threat loomed, a specter that seemed to grow more menacing with each passing day. The more we stayed, the more we risked being drawn into a quagmire, a never-ending cycle of violence and hate.\n\nHe trailed off, his thoughts consumed by the silence. The ash swirled around him, a reminders of the desolation that had been wrought. He felt lost, adrift in a world that seemed to be spinning out of control.\n\nIn the end, he couldn't say what he thought, couldn't find the words to articulate the turmoil that churned within him. He simply sat, lost in the darkness, the ash falling around him like a shroud. [END]",
            "The notion of government intervention in matters of faith strains against the worn fabric of our nation's founding principles. The constitution's clause of separation of church and state stands as a bulwark against the entanglement of the two, safeguarding the freedom of conscience that has come to define us. It's a notion, stark and clear, that the government should not usurp the authority of the churches, but rather allow them to chart their own course.\n\nTo attempt to codify a ban on certain practices, to wield the power of the state against the churches, would be an affront to the very foundation of our democracy. It would be a declaration that one faith's conviction trumps the convictions of another, a notion abhorrent to the tolerant spirit that has long defined our nation.\n\nThe constitution, that revered and oft-repeated text, is a clarion call to the virtues of freedom and the free exercise of conscience. To amend it now, to impose a restriction on the people, would be a perversion of its intent. It would be an amendment born of expediency, not principle, and would serve only to restrict the very people it purports to protect.\n\nThe government's role is not to dictate the terms of faith, but to safeguard the rights of all its citizens to worship as they see fit. The president's push for such an amendment reeks of a bias, a preference for one faith over another. It is a move born of personal conviction, not a desire to serve the greater good.\n\nThe economy, the society, the very fabric of our nation would be better served by leaving the churches to their own devices. For it is in the free exercise of faith, unimpeded by the heavy hand of government, that we find true strength and resilience. The notion that such an amendment would somehow boost the economy or improve society is a tenuous at best, and one that does little to justify the infringement on the rights of the people.\n\nIn the end, it is the churches that must be left to decide their own course, unfettered by the dictates of the state. Anything less would be an affront to the very principles that have come to define us as a nation.",
            "In the desolate landscape of our time, the war in Iraq lies like a festering wound, a scar that refuses to heal. The memories of September 11th, 2001, still linger in the air, a palpable fog that shrouds the truth. The government, a behemoth with a penchant for deception, sought to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks, exploiting the collective grief of the American people. But the connection was tenuous at best, a flimsy thread that snapped beneath the weight of reality.\n\nAs the years went by, the war in Iraq unfolded like a macabre dance, a repetition of the same mistakes made in Vietnam. The government, once again, failed to learn from its past blunders, blind to the consequences of its actions. The soldiers, the brave men and women who fought and died, were mere pawns in a game of power and politics.\n\nTheir deaths, countless and senseless, a grim reminder of the government's hubris. The removal of the Iraqi government, a catastrophic event that left a power vacuum, a chasm that the US was ill-prepared to fill. The aftermath, a maelstrom of chaos and violence, a testament to the government's shortsightedness.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a war that should never have been, a war that was fought on false pretenses. The search for weapons of mass destruction, a mirage that vanished upon closer inspection. The real reason, the true motivation, the lust for oil, a hidden truth that only the most perceptive can see.\n\nAs the years drag on, the casualties mount, the American people are left to wonder: is it worth it? The cost, the human toll, the shattered lives, the families torn apart. The war, a quagmire that seems to have no end, a never-ending cycle of blood and steel.\n\nWe, the people, are left to pick up the pieces, to try to make sense of the madness that has been unleashed. We are naive to believe that democracy can be imposed, that it can be forced upon a people who have not asked for it. We are naive to think that the government will always act with truth and integrity.\n\nIn the end, it is not the war that is the problem, but the lies that led to it, the deceit that shrouds our government, the corruption that permeates our institutions. The war in Iraq is a symptom of a larger disease, a disease that infects us all, a disease of greed, of power, of control.\n\nLet us hope that one day, we will learn from our mistakes, that we will find the courage to confront the truth, to face the darkness that lies within ourselves. Let us hope that the war in Iraq will be a lesson, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power, of the importance of truth and integrity. But until then, we are left to suffer the consequences of our actions, to wander in the desolate landscape of our own making.",
            "The thing is, I don't believe in the constraints of others. I've always thought that love is love, regardless of the specifics. It's personal, a string that binds two souls together. And what's the nature of that string, anyway? Is it something we're born with, a thread of DNA that weaves through our very being? Or is it something we cultivate, a garden of emotions that grow and flourish with time? I think it's a mix of both, a dance of fate and choice.\n\nI've seen it in my own life, the way people live, the way they love. My neighbors, good people, two men living together, just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they tend their garden, they love each other just as any other couple would. And what business is it of mine, or anyone else's, to say otherwise? The President, with his interpretations and his moralities, trying to tell us what marriage means. It's a farce, a charade, a mockery of the very concept.\n\nI've read the studies, the research, the statistics. It's not just a matter of choice, not just a matter of upbringing. There's something biological at play, a chemical whisper in the brain that guides us. And what's wrong with that? Is it not the same as a preference for the color blue or the taste of strawberries? Why should we deny people their fundamental right to love, just because it doesn't fit our narrow definitions?\n\nAnd what of the rest of us, the ones who are comfortable in our own skin, who don't need the validation of society to define our relationships? Shouldn't we be free to live our lives as we see fit, without the weight of others' judgment? Marriage, in the end, is a personal thing, a private contract between two people. It's not for the government to dictate, not for the media to sensationalize. It's a matter of love, of commitment, of two people choosing to spend their lives together.\n\nSo, I say, let us not concern ourselves with the specifics. Let us not try to define what love looks like, what it feels like. Let us simply allow people to be, to love as they choose, without fear of reprisal or rejection. It's a basic human right, after all, and one that we should be proud to defend.",
            "In the vast and unyielding expanse of the digital realm, a singular truth holds sway: once set loose, the words of a man can become the wind that rustles the leaves of countless minds. This is a reality that I have come to know all too well in my role as a resident advisor, where the delicate balance between freedom and responsibility is ever-shifting. When words are breathed into the ether of the internet, they assume a life of their own, unbound by the constraints of time and space. In this boundless expanse, the distinction between jest and earnest intent becomes increasingly tenuous, and the lines between public and private blur like the edges of a forgotten photograph.\n\nAs I've witnessed firsthand, the careless utterance can spark a maelstrom of consequences, as the whispers of a single individual can fan the flames of anxiety and concern among those who would listen. The notion that one's words might be overheard, misinterpreted, or misconstrued by a stranger is a specter that haunts us all, a constant reminder that our thoughts and sentiments are never truly our own once they've been set free.\n\nThe ease with which information can be disseminated, shared, and scrutinized has created a world where one's digital footprint can be traversed at will, stripped bare of its context and reduced to a series of isolated words, each one a potential detonator waiting to ignite the powder keg of public opinion. And in this precarious landscape, the notion of privacy becomes a mirage, a fleeting dream that vanishes upon closer inspection.\n\nIn this regard, the actions of school officials who monitor the digital lives of their students can be seen as both a necessary evil and a brazen invasion of personal space. While it is true that the creation of social media accounts under a pseudonym or the friending of students on Myspace or Facebook can be seen as a delicate balancing act, it is also a reality that the world will not be bound by the confines of a school's walls. When concerns are brought to light, they must be addressed, lest the consequences of inaction prove catastrophic.\n\nIn the end, it is not the act of monitoring itself that is the issue, but rather the manner in which it is executed. The lines between guidance and surveillance are often blurred, leaving one to wonder: where does concern end and intrusion begin? As a resident advisor, I have come to realize that the answer lies not in the act of monitoring itself, but in the context in which it is applied. The delicate dance between freedom and responsibility is a tightrope that must be walked with care, lest the consequences of a misstep prove disastrous.",
            "The war, a drawn-out odyssey besmirched by time. Its purpose, once a beacon of hope, now lost to the murk of ambiguity. We were to be the liberators, the bringers of democracy to a people shackled by tyranny. But the days have turned to years, and the years to an endless expanse of desolation. Our actions, no longer driven by the pure intention of freedom, have been sullied by the stain of self-interest.\n\nWe speak of restoring democracy, but what of the motives that led us down this treacherous path? Were they not tainted by the complexities of power and the personal vendettas of the past? George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, their animosity a festering wound that refused to heal. And so we found ourselves entangled in a quagmire, our purpose diluted by the weight of our own ambitions.\n\nIn the beginning, we made a statement, a declaration of our intent to bring light to a world shrouded in darkness. But time has worn away at our resolve, and we are now mired in the quicksand of indecision. We yearn for a decisive victory, a triumphant end to this conflict, but the truth is, our purpose has been lost to the sands of time.\n\nWe spend billions upon billions, draining our own economy, as our own people suffer. We pour our treasure into a war that has long since lost its justification. The people of the country we sought to liberate are left to fend for themselves, while we squander our resources on a conflict that has become a hollow shell of its former self.\n\nWar is not a luxury we can afford, not in a world where poverty and neglect cry out for attention. We have our own wounds to heal, our own battles to fight. The money we spend on this war could be better spent on schools, on roads, on healthcare, on the very fabric of our own society. And so we are left to ponder the cost of our actions, to wonder if the ends justify the means, and to pray that one day we will find our way back to the purpose that once drove us.\n\nWe are not the liberators we once claimed to be, but rather the perpetrators of a conflict that has lost its way. Our actions, no longer guided by the pure intention of freedom, have become a mere exercise in futility, a testament to the destructive power of human ambition. And so we are left to wonder, what have we accomplished, and at what cost?",
            "The notion that one's life might be saved by the prying eyes of a stranger on the internet, it's a notion that hangs like a specter over the landscape of our modern existence. A specter born of the whispers and warnings that echo through the digital halls, a cautionary tale of the perils that lurk in the shadows of the online world.\n\nIn the virtual realm, we surrender a portion of our lives to the void, allowing the gaze of others to fall upon us like a cold, unforgiving wind. We post and share, we reveal and conceal, all under the guise of convenience and connection. But in doing so, we also invite the unwanted gaze of strangers, their eyes upon us like a chill in the darkness.\n\nConsider the example of Myspace, a platform where one's profile can be accessed by anyone who knows the password, a password shared with friends and acquaintances, a password that grants permission to those who would seek to intrude upon our private lives. And yet, even with such safeguards in place, the boundaries between public and private begin to blur, the lines between consent and invasion growing increasingly indistinct.\n\nIt's a difficult balance to strike, one that weighs the need for connection against the fear of exposure. We yearn for the intimacy of the online world, the ease of communication and the sense of community it provides. And yet, we also fear the prying eyes that lurk in the shadows, the strangers who would seek to exploit our vulnerabilities and manipulate our trust.\n\nThe question remains, is it an invasion of privacy to monitor an individual's online activity, to scour their profile for signs of danger or deceit? Or is it a necessary measure, a means of protecting the vulnerable from those who would seek to harm them? The answer, much like the digital landscape itself, is shrouded in uncertainty, a labyrinth of gray areas and conflicting perspectives.\n\nAs one who has traversed this digital expanse, I can attest to the treacherous nature of online interactions. The ease with which strangers can access our personal information, the ways in which they can manipulate and deceive. It's a world where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are constantly shifting, where the lines between consent and coercion are repeatedly blurred.\n\nAnd yet, even with these risks in mind, I still find myself drawn to the online world, a world that offers a sense of connection and community that is hard to find elsewhere. It's a double-edged sword, one that cuts both ways, offering the promise of intimacy and the threat of invasion.\n\nIn the end, it's a delicate balance, one that requires a constant negotiation between the need for connection and the fear of exposure. A balance that is as fragile as the digital threads that bind us together, as ephemeral as the whispers that echo through the online halls.",
            "In the bleak expanse of a forgotten landscape, the echoes of war linger. The Iraq War, a calamity of grand proportions, casts a long shadow over the world. It was a disaster from its inception, a calamity born of hubris and blind ambition. The consensus was clear: the invasion was a bad idea, a folly that would only lead to more suffering and chaos.\n\nPolls from across the globe bear witness to this fact. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population views the war as a catastrophic mistake. The Iraqi people, the very ones we sought to liberate, now overwhelmingly demand our departure. Even the soldiers who fought in the conflict, a staggering seventy percent, believe the war was a grave error, and that we should extricate ourselves within the year.\n\nYet, like the ghostly apparitions that haunt the ruins of a forgotten city, the war's remnants cling to life. A culture clash of epic proportions has taken hold, a chasm so vast that it defies comprehension. The United States, with its vaunted ideals of democracy, has attempted to impose its will upon a people who would rather chart their own course. The result has been a quagmire, a quagmire of endless suffering and bloodshed.\n\nThe administration's justification for remaining in Iraq is a tangle of half-truths and unconvincing arguments. They speak of stability and security, but these are mere shibboleths, empty words that ring hollow in the face of reality. The people of Iraq have spoken, and their voices are clear: leave us be.\n\nIf we continue to occupy their land, we risk perpetuating the very cycle of violence and chaos we sought to eradicate. The statistics are stark: eighty percent of Iraqis demand our departure within the year, and a quarter of them urge us to leave immediately. These are the people we claim to be liberating, the people we claim to be saving. Do we not listen to their pleas?\n\nPerhaps it is time to acknowledge that our presence in Iraq has been a disaster, a calamity that will only continue to unfold if we remain. We have been told that we are the good guys, that we are the bringers of democracy and freedom. But the truth is more nuanced, more complicated. We are a power, a force that has imposed its will upon a people who would rather live under their own terms.\n\nThe time has come to extricate ourselves from this quagmire. We must listen to the voices of the Iraqi people, to the soldiers who have fought and bled for a cause that has lost all sense. We must acknowledge the reality of our failure, and begin the long and arduous process of withdrawal.\n\nFor in the end, it is not our presence that has brought stability to Iraq, but rather our absence. It is our departure that will allow the Iraqi people to chart their own course, to forge their own destiny. Only then can we hope to redeem ourselves, to find a glimmer of redemption in the ashes of our failure.",
            "In a land ravaged by the fetid breath of prejudice, where the stench of inequality clings to every surface, the specter of gender bias haunts the streets of America. It is a cancer, festering in the marrow of society, its tendrils snaking into every crevice of the workaday world. The glass ceiling, that supposedly transparent barrier, still bars the way for women, who toil in the shadows, their talents and abilities obscured by the weight of a millennia-old narrative.\n\nIn the rarefied realm of corporate power, the boardroom elite often prove unwilling to promote women to positions of authority, their decisions guided by a historically entrenched bias that views the feminine as inferior. And yet, this is not a one-way street; men too, in certain industries, are subject to the whims of societal expectation. In the rarefied world of fashion, for instance, a man's interest in the field is often met with skepticism, as if his very masculinity is somehow suspect. His involvement is seen as a novelty, a fleeting aberration from the norm.\n\nIn the domestic sphere, the traditional division of labor often renders stay-at-home fathers vulnerable to ridicule and scorn. The societal expectation that men must be breadwinners, providers, is a heavy burden to bear, and one that can weigh heavily on the male half of the equation. Why, the critics ask, would a man choose to abandon his masculine duties and devote himself to childcare? The answer, of course, is that he may simply wish to be present, to nurture and guide his children as they grow and develop. But this is a notion that society has yet to fully grasp.\n\nAs we navigate the labyrinthine corridors of progress, it becomes clear that change is a slow and arduous process. The needle of equality has moved, incrementally, over the years, but there is still much work to be done. Women have made strides in the corporate world, taking on leadership roles and shattering glass ceilings. But the journey is far from over. Men, too, are beginning to re-evaluate their roles, questioning the traditional expectations placed upon them.\n\nIn this delicate dance of social evolution, it is crucial that we tread carefully, lest we risk alienating those we seek to persuade. To boldly push for change can be counterproductive, often triggering resistance in those who feel threatened by the status quo. Instead, we must strive to highlight the qualities that make individuals exceptional, regardless of their background or biology. By celebrating the unique strengths and talents of those who defy societal norms, we can create a more inclusive, more compassionate world.\n\nIn this fragile balance, we find ourselves at a crossroads. The road ahead is long, winding, and fraught with obstacles. But it is a journey we must undertake, for the sake of our collective humanity. By acknowledging the many faces of discrimination, we can begin to chip away at the edifice of prejudice, one small step at a time. And though the progress may be slow, it is a journey worth taking, for in the end, it is only by embracing our differences that we may truly find common ground.",
            "The laws changed, a shift in the current. Decriminalization, they called it. The weight of the law, no longer crushing. The man's hands, freed from the chains of oppression, now grasped the reins of reason. It was no longer a felony, but a mere infraction, a speed ticket to be dealt with and forgotten. The people worried about the consequences, the stains on their records, the whispers of disapproval. But the cost of arrest, of prosecution, of incarceration, a heavy burden, one that could be lifted. The municipalities, struggling to stay afloat, saw the sense in it. The city of Denver, a bastion of progress, a place where the wind of change blew strong, where the people were open-minded, where the chains of tradition were shed. And so they moved forward, leaving behind the shackles of the past.\n\nBut the debate raged on, a tempest in a teapot. Some said it was a slippery slope, a Pandora's box that would unleash a torrent of chaos upon the land. The streets would be choked with the stench of smoke, the air thick with the haze of euphoria. The motor skills of the drivers would falter, the roads a battleground of accidents and mayhem. And the society, already fragile, would crumble under the weight of this new freedom.\n\nBut others saw it differently, a glass half full, a cup overflowing with possibilities. The money, once spent on the war on drugs, could be poured into the streams of education, of social programs, of food for the hungry. The people, once imprisoned, could be free, their minds unshackled, their creativity unbridled. And the city, once a wasteland of despair, could bloom, a garden of hope and opportunity.\n\nI myself am torn, a ship tossed on the waves of doubt. I see the arguments on both sides, the pros and cons, the for and against. But as I stand on the shore, looking out at the sea of uncertainty, I am drawn to the tide of progress. The future, like the horizon, stretches out before us, a vast expanse of possibility. And I believe that we must move forward, into the unknown, with hope in our hearts and the wind at our backs.",
            "In the hush of reflection, I find myself standing at the precipice of tradition. The echoes of the past reverberate, reminding me that many of the actions we undertake are rooted in a bygone era. Like the worn grooves of a well-traveled path, these customs have been etched into our collective psyche, their familiarity a comforting certainty. Yet, it is equally essential to acknowledge the necessity of adaptability, to bend with the winds of change like a withered branch yielding to the tempest.\n\nIn the Catholic faith, tradition is a sacred trust, a set of dogma handed down through the ages. The expectation is clear: attend Mass each Sunday, adhere to the doctrine, and be judged by the strictest of standards. But beneath the surface, a discordant note resonates – a dissonance born of contradiction. For while the Church preaches love and acceptance, its practices often falter, excluding those who do not conform, those whose devotion is deemed imperfect.\n\nMy own family's story is a testament to this paradox. My parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian, were barred from marrying in the Catholic Church due to my father's denomination. The harsh judgment of the Church's rigid expectations left a bitter taste, a reminder that its teachings often fall short of its ideals. The lesson learned was clear: the pursuit of love and acceptance is often at odds with the strictures of tradition.\n\nAs I ponder the role of priests, I am drawn to the question of their marital status. Permitting them to marry might alleviate some of the suffering that has plagued the Church, but would it truly prevent the aberrant behavior of those who would harm children? I fear not, for the corruption of the heart is a burden that cannot be easily lifted. The pedophilic tendencies of some may be a manifestation of deeper, more complex issues, and marriage, or the lack thereof, is merely a symptom, not a cause.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that holds the key to redemption, but rather a fundamental shift in values, a recognition that love and acceptance know no bounds, that the dignity of every soul is paramount. The Church's adherence to tradition, while comforting to some, must not come at the expense of its most vulnerable members. As I reflect on this complex web of doctrine and practice, I am left with a sense of unease, a feeling that the Church's rigid stance on marriage and family is a mere facade, a veil that conceals the true depths of its convictions.",
            "The mire of this conundrum has left me lost in its stagnant waters. The weight of the question presses upon me like a physical force, an unseen hand that pinches at the joints of my mind. Separation of church and state, a delicate balance that teeters on the precipice of offense, a tremulous dance between the sacred and the secular. And at the heart of it all, the sacrament of marriage, a bond forged in the fire of devotion, a union of flesh and soul. Can it be reduced to a civil contract, a mere trifle of state recognition? Must the government's gaze be turned away, refusing to sully its eyes with the intimate details of love?\n\nI am torn, a leaf caught in the whirlpool of opposing currents. The idea of marriage as a civil union seems a paltry thing, a shallow imitation of the true bond that exists between two souls. And yet, can the state truly be expected to recognize the sacrament, to confer upon it a status that transcends the mundane? The impulse to separate church and state, to keep the sacred and the profane apart, is a noble one. But does it not risk reducing the human experience to a mere cipher, a series of sterile abstractions?\n\nThe notion of gay marriage stirs up a tempest within me, a maelstrom of conflicting emotions. Is it not a union of two people, a bond that should be recognized and respected, regardless of the trappings of tradition or convention? And yet, can it be said that this union is the same as that of any other couple, that the government's recognition of it would not somehow sully the very fabric of society?\n\nThe call for a federal law, a logical conclusion arrived at through the aggregation of state opinions, seems a palatable solution. But a constitutional amendment, a sweeping change to the foundation of our society, seems an overreach, a reaction born of passion rather than reason. To amend the constitution for this cause alone seems a gross overstatement, a recognition of the importance of this issue that I do not share.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, lost in the mire of this conundrum. The question of gay marriage, like the question of the separation of church and state, is a complex and multifaceted one, a Gordian knot that resists easy solution. I can offer no clear answer, only the murmur of doubts and uncertainties that haunt me like a specter.",
            "I grew up in a household where faith was a guiding force, and as such, I've grappled with the concept of homosexuality in a manner both introspective and ambivalent. My relationships with individuals who identify as gay have fostered a certain familiarity, yet I've come to realize that my own stance on the matter is complex and multifaceted. I do not entirely condone the lifestyle, but I firmly believe that it should be a decision left to the discretion of each individual state, rather than a federal mandate.\n\nI understand that our nation is comprised of diverse states, each with their own unique values and ideologies. Democratic states, for instance, tend to lean more progressive on issues such as gay marriage. Were one to reside in a state that has chosen to legalize gay marriage, I believe it would be prudent to respect their decision, for it is a choice one makes by residing within that state's borders.\n\nMy stance is not that homosexuality should be universally accepted or condemned; rather, I believe that individuals should be afforded the same opportunities and rights as their heterosexual counterparts. Therefore, the decision to legalize gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state, allowing them to govern their own affairs without undue federal interference.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the president's views on the matter should not supersede the will of individual states. The notion that President Bush's stance on gay marriage should dictate a nationwide policy seems misguided, as he represents but one aspect of our federal government. Ultimately, it is the states themselves that must live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president. Thus, I firmly believe that each state should have the autonomy to decide its own stance on gay marriage, free from federal overreach.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not support a blanket nationwide ban on gay marriage. Instead, I advocate for a system where individual states are empowered to make their own decisions, allowing for a more nuanced and diverse approach to this complex issue.",
            "The notion that posting on Myspace is a public thing is a notion that I do not at all subscribe to. I suppose it's a notion that's been drummed into our collective consciousness - that anything one posts on the internet is fair game for anyone to see. But that's not entirely true.\n\nWhen one posts something on the internet, whether it be a bulletin or a simple message, that action is not without consequence. It's akin to shouting one's innermost thoughts from the mountaintop - anything that escapes the confines of the digital realm can be seen and heard by anyone who dares to listen.\n\nAnd it's precisely this notion that I think the school officials had a right to consider when they accessed my Myspace profile. Even if I wasn't posting under the school's name, the fact remains that they could have accessed it from their homes, and that's a distinction without a difference. The fact that they were keeping a watchful eye on their students' online activities is not an invasion of privacy, but rather a necessary measure to ensure the safety of those in their care.\n\nI recall a conversation I had with a teacher of mine at my public high school, in which we discussed the necessity of monitoring students' online activities. We talked about how lock downs and drills were put in place to prepare for the unthinkable, and how those measures were a direct response to the fear of terrorist attacks and school shootings. I see the school officials' actions as an extension of that same logic - a proactive measure to prevent anything bad from happening.\n\nThe fact that I may have posted something on Myspace that I didn't intend for school officials to see is beside the point. The truth is, once something is on the internet, it's always there, waiting to be discovered. And I'd be foolish to think that my words wouldn't have consequences. It's a risk we all take when we post online, and it's one that I'm not naive enough to ignore.\n\nIn the end, I think the school officials' actions were justified. If it means keeping students safe, then I'm all for it. And that's what I've been trying to say all along - it's a public thing, and we should be aware of the consequences of our actions.",
            "The ghosts of war still linger within me, a specter born of the embers of nine eleven. It was a day that seared my soul, a day that laid bare the abyss that separates us from the chaos that festers beyond our borders. I recall the fervor that gripped me then, a zeal that blinded me to the ruin that would follow. We were a nation bent on vengeance, driven by a hunger for retribution that would only be satiated by the destruction of others. But in the aftermath, I came to see the folly of our endeavors. The flames of war had been fanned by emotions, not reason, and we marched forward with a zealot's fervor, unprepared for the devastation that would be wrought.\n\nIn the crucible of war, I witnessed the contradictions that have long defined our relationship with the world. We speak of progress, of freedom, of democracy, but our actions betray a grim reality: that we are a people bent on imposing our will upon others, rather than listening to their stories, their struggles, and their hopes. The people of Iraq, I came to realize, were not our enemies, but rather, they were us – flawed, imperfect, and torn asunder by our own making.\n\nWe delved into the heart of their world with a recklessness that bordered on savagery, our actions driven by a desire to reshape their destiny, rather than to understand their plight. And in the end, we created a void, a chasm that cannot be bridged. The war has left us with a legacy of blood and ash, a reminder that our power is not a panacea, but a poison that has seeped into the very fabric of their being.\n\nI have come to believe that we are not the saviors we pretend to be, but rather, we are the authors of our own undoing. Our presence has only served to embolden the very factions we sought to vanquish, and our departure will only hasten the collapse of a system that has been forever altered by our interference. We have sown the seeds of discord, and now we reap the whirlwind.\n\nIn the silence of the night, I am haunted by the voices of the dead, their whispers a reminder of the cost of our hubris. I am left to ponder the wisdom of our actions, to question the motives that drove us forward, and to wonder if we have been foolish to believe that we could impose our will upon the world. The ghosts of war still linger, a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that the price of our pride may be higher than we can bear."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

The Church's inflexibility on matters such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control has become a barrier to its relevance, a stumbling block that is causing it to lose its hold on the faithful.\n\nThe winds of change are whispering through the corridors of history, and the Church's refusal to adapt is leaving it vulnerable to the tempests of dissent. The issue is not that the Church's views are without merit, but rather that they are seemingly frozen in a bygone era, unyielding to the currents of progress. By clinging to these outdated tenets, the Church risks losing its flock, its members drifting away like autumn leaves on a gusty day.\n\nIn an age of growing acceptance and understanding, the Church's stance on these issues seems increasingly out of sync. The result is a chasm between the faithful and those who would follow, a chasm that threatens to swallow the Church whole. The Church's rejection of abortion, for example, may be a catechism of old, but in a world where choices and opinions are increasingly nuanced, it can no longer be the sole arbiter of truth.\n\nThe notion that priests must remain celibate, that they are wedded to God alone, seems a relic of a bygone era. In a world where professionals and families coexist, where devotion and duty are not mutually exclusive, it is puzzling that the Church cannot see the value in allowing its priests to form meaningful connections with the world. The Church's stance on female priests, too, raises questions about its commitment to equality and justice. In a world where women are increasingly empowered, why should the Church lag behind?\n\nThe Church's inability to adapt has led to a crisis of faith, a sense of disillusionment that has left many questioning its relevance. Like a great oak whose branches have been pruned back, the Church risks becoming a hollow shell of its former self, a relic of a bygone era. It is time for the Church to reassess its stance on these issues, to find a middle ground that will allow it to reconnect with the world and reclaim its place as a beacon of hope and guidance.\n\nIn the stillness of the night, as the world outside recedes into the shadows, the Church must confront the darkness within. It is a darkness that threatens to consume it, to leave it a hollow husk of its former self. But it is also a darkness that holds the seed of redemption, a chance for the Church to rediscover its mission and its purpose. Let us hope that it will seize this opportunity, that it will find a way to heal the schisms and reconnect with the world.",
            "The query of marriage. A fissure in the bedrock of our societal edifice. I find myself pondering this issue, torn asunder by the conflicting tides of reason and sentiment. As I sit in the desolate silence, the ash-strewn landscape stretching out before me like a funereal shroud, I am drawn to the notion that the manner in which one is born is not a choice, but a cold, unforgiving fact. Like the wind that howls through the barren trees, it is a force beyond our control, a primal urge that cannot be tempered by human will.\n\nIn this bleak and unforgiving world, I believe it is our duty to acknowledge and respect the intrinsic nature of those around us. To hold individuals accountable for their orientation is to impose a moral judgment, a notion that seems as futile as attempting to stem the tide of a raging river. The fluidity of existence is a mystery that defies our understanding, and to try to impose our own morality upon it is to risk being consumed by its turbulent depths.\n\nThe federal government, with its heavy hand and broad brush, seems an ill-equipped arbiter of this issue. Their involvement is a clumsy intrusion, a clumsy attempt to impose order on a chaos that resists our comprehension. It is a question of personal liberty, not national security or moral rectitude, and thus falls outside the purview of their authority.\n\nIn the end, it is a matter of basic humanity. To deny individuals their right to love and be loved, to be who they are without fear of reprisal or condemnation, is to deny the very essence of our shared experience. And so, like the wind that blows through the desolate landscape, I am drawn to the notion that this is a matter of simple decency, a fundamental aspect of our shared humanity that cannot be legislated or regulated away.",
            "In this desolate expanse of our world, where the crumbling edifices of morality stand as hollow testaments to the transience of values, the question of gay marriage lingers, a festering wound that refuses to heal. It is a debate that has been reduced to a cacophony of sound bites, a jumbled mess of half-truths and misconceptions, where the voices of reason are drowned out by the din of ignorance.\n\nBut amidst this chaos, a glimmer of sense can be found. It is a simple truth, one that has been lost in the mire of fear and prejudice: that love knows no bounds, neither those of sex nor those of creed. It is a force that transcends the petty squabbles of humanity, a flame that burns bright and true, unencumbered by the shackles of societal expectation.\n\nThe arguments against gay marriage are legion, a litany of half-baked excuses and crackpot theories, each one a feeble attempt to justify the unjustifiable. The notion that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family is nothing but a red herring, a canard perpetuated by those who would seek to maintain their grip on power. It is a tired, threadbare argument, one that has been disproven time and time again by the simple fact of existence.\n\nAnd yet, it persists. Like a festering wound, it refuses to heal, a constant reminder of the dark underbelly of human nature. But it is a wound that can be healed, one that can be cauterized by the simple act of compassion and understanding.\n\nThe scientific studies are clear: gay couples are just as capable of sustained, fulfilling relationships as their heterosexual counterparts. They share the same hopes, the same dreams, the same fears. They are not somehow inherently different, nor are they somehow lesser. They are human beings, just as we are, with all the frailties and vulnerabilities that come with it.\n\nAnd yet, the debate rages on, fueled by the passions of the ignorant and the bigoted. It is a debate that has nothing to do with the rights of individuals, but rather with the power of the state to dictate what is and is not acceptable. It is a debate that has been hijacked by the zealots, who would seek to impose their will on the rest of us.\n\nBut it is a futile effort, one that will ultimately be doomed to failure. For the truth will out, no matter how hard we try to bury it. The fact is that gay marriage is not about the rights of the individual, but about the fundamental human right to love and be loved in return. It is about the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of their creed, their color, or their orientation.\n\nAnd so, as we stumble through this dark world, as we navigate the minefield of morality and ethics, we must remember this simple truth: that love is the one constant that binds us all together. It is the one thing that can transcend the petty squabbles of humanity, that can bring us together in a shared humanity.\n\nIn the end, it is not about the politics of it all, nor is it about the religious fervor that drives so many to oppose it. It is about the simple, human need to love and be loved. It is about the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of who they are or who they love.\n\nIn this desolate expanse of our world, where the crumbling edifices of morality stand as hollow testaments to the transience of values, this is the one thing that remains constant: the human heart, beating with a love that knows no bounds.",
            "The pharmacy I work at during the summer months is a place where the boundaries between life and death are blurred. It's a place where the very fabric of existence is stretched thin, where the threads of hope and despair are intertwined. I've seen it time and time again - the desperation in the eyes of those who come seeking solace in the pills and potions we dispense. But it's a double-edged sword, one that cuts both ways. For every life it saves, it takes another. The line between benefit and harm is a thin one, and it's a line that's often crossed.\n\nThe illegal nature of a drug, I've come to realize, is no guarantee of its inherent value. There are many substances, like oxycodone and Vicodin, that are forbidden yet still find their way into our pharmacy. We use them because they possess certain... let's call them \"properties\" that make them beneficial to our patients. But what of marijuana, that most vilified of substances? Is it not worthy of the same consideration?\n\nThe parallels between marijuana and alcohol are often drawn, but they're a false one. Both can be abused, yes, but the latter is a poison that ravages the soul as much as the body. Marijuana, on the other hand, is a substance that can be harnessed, its benefits realized with restraint. The key, I firmly believe, lies in education and understanding. If we can peel away the stigma, the taboo that surrounds it, perhaps we can unlock its true potential.\n\nBut how do we do this? By embracing it wholeheartedly, without reservation? I think not. No, the path forward lies in gradual integration, a measured approach that balances the desire for freedom with the need for responsibility. Remove the shackles of prohibition, and we risk unleashing a torrent of abuse. But by allowing it, in measured doses, we may yet find a way to harness its benefits.\n\nThe images that surround marijuana are distorted, a caricature of the truth. It's not the devil's weed, as some would have you believe, but a plant with its own unique properties and potential. And it's precisely this potential that we should be exploring, not demonizing. For in the end, it's not the substance itself that's the problem, but our own perceptions of it.",
            "The church, a monument to the shifting tides of time, has surrendered to the whims of the twenty-first century. Its once-imposing façade now yields to the casualities of modernity. Gone are the days of strict adherence to tradition; the hushed tones of reverence give way to the murmur of the mundane. I recall Sundays spent in the pews of my youth, the ritual of dressing in my best attire a testament to the gravity of the occasion. My mother would fuss over my outfit, ensuring that I was presented to the world with the dignity befitting a child of the Lord. The private school I attended added to the sense of formality, where on weekends I would reunite with friends clad in our finest Sunday finery.\n\nBut times change, and the church has adapted, its services shrinking to a mere thirty minutes, a concession to the fleeting nature of attention spans. The summer months bring an influx of beachwear, a far cry from the starched collars and high-button shoes of yesteryear. Even the morning masses, once a bastion of tradition, have given way to the informality of jeans and khakis. It is a sea change, one that I neither condone nor lament, merely acknowledge.\n\nAs for the issue of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I believe it is a canker that cannot be excised by a simple change in policy. The institution has been beset by scandal, and it is a tragedy that these atrocities could have been perpetrated under the very roof of the Lord. Some might suggest that allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry could have mitigated these instances, but I fear it is a chimera. Pedophilia is a fundamental aspect of human nature, a flaw that cannot be rectified by the mere trappings of societal norms.\n\nI recall a television show, Seventh Heaven, where a reverend was depicted as a married man of the cloth. It seemed a quaint notion, a far cry from the strictures of the Catholic Church. But even in that context, the reverend's marital status did not preclude him from his duties as a spiritual leader. It is a distinction without a difference; the underlying impulse remains the same.\n\nI believe that pedophilia is an inescapable aspect of human biology, a product of genetics rather than environment. It is a notion that cannot be altered by the trappings of social convention. The church, in all its forms, must confront this reality head-on, acknowledging the darkness that lurks within its midst. To pretend otherwise is to court disaster.\n\nAs I ponder the Catholic Church, I am left with a sense of sorrow and disillusionment. The institution has failed in its duty to protect the most vulnerable, and for that, it will forever bear the stain of shame. But I do not believe that it is a matter of policy or procedure; it is a fundamental failing of humanity itself.",
            "The embers of a once burning fire had long since dwindled to cold ash, and the embers of truth were no less extinguished. The precipice from which we leapt into the chasm of Iraq was shrouded in a mist of deceit, its precipitating factor the aftermath of September 11th. The administration's glib supposition, that the war was a direct response to the attacks, had been a mere pretext, a paltry attempt to obscure the true intent.\n\nA certain duplicity had become a defining characteristic of the Bush administration, their penchant for deception having left a trail of ruin in its wake. The specter of malfeasance hung heavy, as the very fabric of our democracy was strained to its breaking point. Even the stalwart Colin Powell, now an apostate from the fold, had publicly confessed to harboring doubts regarding the veracity of the evidence presented at the UN.\n\nThe Constitution, that sacred document upon which our nation was founded, was wilfully disregarded, its principles and protections callously cast aside. The administration's actions were a betrayal of the very oath they had sworn to uphold, an affront to the concept of truth and accountability. It was a brazen attempt to supplant the rule of law with the rule of whim, a reckless disregard for the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe instrumentalities of power, wielded by an administration hell-bent on self-aggrandizement, had been used to further their own interests, rather than the interests of the nation they claimed to serve. The specter of a 'blood vengeance' against Saddam Hussein loomed large, a vendetta born of the past, and a hunger for power that would stop at nothing.\n\nThe war, a catastrophic and misguided endeavor, had dragged on for far too long, its costs in blood and treasure incalculable. The prospect of withdrawal was fraught with peril, the very real possibility of civil war and further bloodshed hanging in the balance. The nascent government, a fragile and ephemeral thing, teetered on the brink of collapse, its sovereignty hanging precariously in the balance.\n\nA coalition of surrounding nations, a Faustian bargain, was touted as the solution, a panacea for the ills that had been wrought. But this would only serve to sow the seeds of future discord, as the very notion of Iraqi sovereignty was cast aside, and the nation was plunged into further chaos.\n\nIn the midst of this maelstrom, the once-promising interim government was reduced to a mere shell of its former self, a hollow husk devoid of authority or direction. The Parliament, a shadow of its former self, was riven by factional squabbles, its effectiveness nonexistent. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, wielded little real power, as the radical elements, still vying for control, continued to sow discord and instability.\n\nAnd so, we find ourselves lost in a wilderness of confusion, our national discourse reduced to a cacophony of sound and fury, signifying nothing. The truth, that most elusive of commodities, had been lost in the maelstrom, leaving us to pick up the pieces of a shattered nation, and to wonder if redemption was even possible.",
            "In the hollow of his chest, a faint murmur stirred. He strained to think of the war in Iraq, to grasp the threads of his thoughts and weave them into a coherent tapestry. The silence was oppressive, a weight that pressed upon his mind like the ashes that shrouded the land. He sought to speak, to articulate the turmoil that churned within him, but the words refused to come.\n\nHe began, haltingly, his voice a tentative whisper. It feels pointless, he said, this war that raged across the desert sands. No declaration, no formal call to arms, just a maelstrom of blood and fire that consumed all in its path. And for what? To impose our will upon a people, to force upon them a democracy that would be nothing more than a pale imitation of our own? The thought was galling, a bitter taste that soured his mouth.\n\nBut then, too, he thought of the families, the sons and daughters who had been torn from their homes, sent to fight in a war that seemed without purpose. And the people of Iraq, their lives shattered, their cities reduced to rubble. He felt a pang of guilt, a sense of responsibility for the destruction that had been wrought.\n\nAnd yet, he couldn't shake the feeling that we were meddling, imposing our values upon a culture that was not our own. The Al-Kaida threat loomed, a specter that seemed to grow more menacing with each passing day. The more we stayed, the more we risked being drawn into a quagmire, a never-ending cycle of violence and hate.\n\nHe trailed off, his thoughts consumed by the silence. The ash swirled around him, a reminders of the desolation that had been wrought. He felt lost, adrift in a world that seemed to be spinning out of control.\n\nIn the end, he couldn't say what he thought, couldn't find the words to articulate the turmoil that churned within him. He simply sat, lost in the darkness, the ash falling around him like a shroud. [END]",
            "The notion of government intervention in matters of faith strains against the worn fabric of our nation's founding principles. The constitution's clause of separation of church and state stands as a bulwark against the entanglement of the two, safeguarding the freedom of conscience that has come to define us. It's a notion, stark and clear, that the government should not usurp the authority of the churches, but rather allow them to chart their own course.\n\nTo attempt to codify a ban on certain practices, to wield the power of the state against the churches, would be an affront to the very foundation of our democracy. It would be a declaration that one faith's conviction trumps the convictions of another, a notion abhorrent to the tolerant spirit that has long defined our nation.\n\nThe constitution, that revered and oft-repeated text, is a clarion call to the virtues of freedom and the free exercise of conscience. To amend it now, to impose a restriction on the people, would be a perversion of its intent. It would be an amendment born of expediency, not principle, and would serve only to restrict the very people it purports to protect.\n\nThe government's role is not to dictate the terms of faith, but to safeguard the rights of all its citizens to worship as they see fit. The president's push for such an amendment reeks of a bias, a preference for one faith over another. It is a move born of personal conviction, not a desire to serve the greater good.\n\nThe economy, the society, the very fabric of our nation would be better served by leaving the churches to their own devices. For it is in the free exercise of faith, unimpeded by the heavy hand of government, that we find true strength and resilience. The notion that such an amendment would somehow boost the economy or improve society is a tenuous at best, and one that does little to justify the infringement on the rights of the people.\n\nIn the end, it is the churches that must be left to decide their own course, unfettered by the dictates of the state. Anything less would be an affront to the very principles that have come to define us as a nation.",
            "In the desolate landscape of our time, the war in Iraq lies like a festering wound, a scar that refuses to heal. The memories of September 11th, 2001, still linger in the air, a palpable fog that shrouds the truth. The government, a behemoth with a penchant for deception, sought to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks, exploiting the collective grief of the American people. But the connection was tenuous at best, a flimsy thread that snapped beneath the weight of reality.\n\nAs the years went by, the war in Iraq unfolded like a macabre dance, a repetition of the same mistakes made in Vietnam. The government, once again, failed to learn from its past blunders, blind to the consequences of its actions. The soldiers, the brave men and women who fought and died, were mere pawns in a game of power and politics.\n\nTheir deaths, countless and senseless, a grim reminder of the government's hubris. The removal of the Iraqi government, a catastrophic event that left a power vacuum, a chasm that the US was ill-prepared to fill. The aftermath, a maelstrom of chaos and violence, a testament to the government's shortsightedness.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a war that should never have been, a war that was fought on false pretenses. The search for weapons of mass destruction, a mirage that vanished upon closer inspection. The real reason, the true motivation, the lust for oil, a hidden truth that only the most perceptive can see.\n\nAs the years drag on, the casualties mount, the American people are left to wonder: is it worth it? The cost, the human toll, the shattered lives, the families torn apart. The war, a quagmire that seems to have no end, a never-ending cycle of blood and steel.\n\nWe, the people, are left to pick up the pieces, to try to make sense of the madness that has been unleashed. We are naive to believe that democracy can be imposed, that it can be forced upon a people who have not asked for it. We are naive to think that the government will always act with truth and integrity.\n\nIn the end, it is not the war that is the problem, but the lies that led to it, the deceit that shrouds our government, the corruption that permeates our institutions. The war in Iraq is a symptom of a larger disease, a disease that infects us all, a disease of greed, of power, of control.\n\nLet us hope that one day, we will learn from our mistakes, that we will find the courage to confront the truth, to face the darkness that lies within ourselves. Let us hope that the war in Iraq will be a lesson, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power, of the importance of truth and integrity. But until then, we are left to suffer the consequences of our actions, to wander in the desolate landscape of our own making.",
            "The thing is, I don't believe in the constraints of others. I've always thought that love is love, regardless of the specifics. It's personal, a string that binds two souls together. And what's the nature of that string, anyway? Is it something we're born with, a thread of DNA that weaves through our very being? Or is it something we cultivate, a garden of emotions that grow and flourish with time? I think it's a mix of both, a dance of fate and choice.\n\nI've seen it in my own life, the way people live, the way they love. My neighbors, good people, two men living together, just like any other family. They walk their dogs, they tend their garden, they love each other just as any other couple would. And what business is it of mine, or anyone else's, to say otherwise? The President, with his interpretations and his moralities, trying to tell us what marriage means. It's a farce, a charade, a mockery of the very concept.\n\nI've read the studies, the research, the statistics. It's not just a matter of choice, not just a matter of upbringing. There's something biological at play, a chemical whisper in the brain that guides us. And what's wrong with that? Is it not the same as a preference for the color blue or the taste of strawberries? Why should we deny people their fundamental right to love, just because it doesn't fit our narrow definitions?\n\nAnd what of the rest of us, the ones who are comfortable in our own skin, who don't need the validation of society to define our relationships? Shouldn't we be free to live our lives as we see fit, without the weight of others' judgment? Marriage, in the end, is a personal thing, a private contract between two people. It's not for the government to dictate, not for the media to sensationalize. It's a matter of love, of commitment, of two people choosing to spend their lives together.\n\nSo, I say, let us not concern ourselves with the specifics. Let us not try to define what love looks like, what it feels like. Let us simply allow people to be, to love as they choose, without fear of reprisal or rejection. It's a basic human right, after all, and one that we should be proud to defend.",
            "In the vast and unyielding expanse of the digital realm, a singular truth holds sway: once set loose, the words of a man can become the wind that rustles the leaves of countless minds. This is a reality that I have come to know all too well in my role as a resident advisor, where the delicate balance between freedom and responsibility is ever-shifting. When words are breathed into the ether of the internet, they assume a life of their own, unbound by the constraints of time and space. In this boundless expanse, the distinction between jest and earnest intent becomes increasingly tenuous, and the lines between public and private blur like the edges of a forgotten photograph.\n\nAs I've witnessed firsthand, the careless utterance can spark a maelstrom of consequences, as the whispers of a single individual can fan the flames of anxiety and concern among those who would listen. The notion that one's words might be overheard, misinterpreted, or misconstrued by a stranger is a specter that haunts us all, a constant reminder that our thoughts and sentiments are never truly our own once they've been set free.\n\nThe ease with which information can be disseminated, shared, and scrutinized has created a world where one's digital footprint can be traversed at will, stripped bare of its context and reduced to a series of isolated words, each one a potential detonator waiting to ignite the powder keg of public opinion. And in this precarious landscape, the notion of privacy becomes a mirage, a fleeting dream that vanishes upon closer inspection.\n\nIn this regard, the actions of school officials who monitor the digital lives of their students can be seen as both a necessary evil and a brazen invasion of personal space. While it is true that the creation of social media accounts under a pseudonym or the friending of students on Myspace or Facebook can be seen as a delicate balancing act, it is also a reality that the world will not be bound by the confines of a school's walls. When concerns are brought to light, they must be addressed, lest the consequences of inaction prove catastrophic.\n\nIn the end, it is not the act of monitoring itself that is the issue, but rather the manner in which it is executed. The lines between guidance and surveillance are often blurred, leaving one to wonder: where does concern end and intrusion begin? As a resident advisor, I have come to realize that the answer lies not in the act of monitoring itself, but in the context in which it is applied. The delicate dance between freedom and responsibility is a tightrope that must be walked with care, lest the consequences of a misstep prove disastrous.",
            "The war, a drawn-out odyssey besmirched by time. Its purpose, once a beacon of hope, now lost to the murk of ambiguity. We were to be the liberators, the bringers of democracy to a people shackled by tyranny. But the days have turned to years, and the years to an endless expanse of desolation. Our actions, no longer driven by the pure intention of freedom, have been sullied by the stain of self-interest.\n\nWe speak of restoring democracy, but what of the motives that led us down this treacherous path? Were they not tainted by the complexities of power and the personal vendettas of the past? George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, their animosity a festering wound that refused to heal. And so we found ourselves entangled in a quagmire, our purpose diluted by the weight of our own ambitions.\n\nIn the beginning, we made a statement, a declaration of our intent to bring light to a world shrouded in darkness. But time has worn away at our resolve, and we are now mired in the quicksand of indecision. We yearn for a decisive victory, a triumphant end to this conflict, but the truth is, our purpose has been lost to the sands of time.\n\nWe spend billions upon billions, draining our own economy, as our own people suffer. We pour our treasure into a war that has long since lost its justification. The people of the country we sought to liberate are left to fend for themselves, while we squander our resources on a conflict that has become a hollow shell of its former self.\n\nWar is not a luxury we can afford, not in a world where poverty and neglect cry out for attention. We have our own wounds to heal, our own battles to fight. The money we spend on this war could be better spent on schools, on roads, on healthcare, on the very fabric of our own society. And so we are left to ponder the cost of our actions, to wonder if the ends justify the means, and to pray that one day we will find our way back to the purpose that once drove us.\n\nWe are not the liberators we once claimed to be, but rather the perpetrators of a conflict that has lost its way. Our actions, no longer guided by the pure intention of freedom, have become a mere exercise in futility, a testament to the destructive power of human ambition.

A specter born of the whispers and warnings that echo through the digital halls, a cautionary tale of the perils that lurk in the shadows of the online world.\n\nIn the virtual realm, we surrender a portion of our lives to the void, allowing the gaze of others to fall upon us like a cold, unforgiving wind. We post and share, we reveal and conceal, all under the guise of convenience and connection. But in doing so, we also invite the unwanted gaze of strangers, their eyes upon us like a chill in the darkness.\n\nConsider the example of Myspace, a platform where one's profile can be accessed by anyone who knows the password, a password shared with friends and acquaintances, a password that grants permission to those who would seek to intrude upon our private lives. And yet, even with such safeguards in place, the boundaries between public and private begin to blur, the lines between consent and invasion growing increasingly indistinct.\n\nIt's a difficult balance to strike, one that weighs the need for connection against the fear of exposure. We yearn for the intimacy of the online world, the ease of communication and the sense of community it provides. And yet, we also fear the prying eyes that lurk in the shadows, the strangers who would seek to exploit our vulnerabilities and manipulate our trust.\n\nThe question remains, is it an invasion of privacy to monitor an individual's online activity, to scour their profile for signs of danger or deceit? Or is it a necessary measure, a means of protecting the vulnerable from those who would seek to harm them? The answer, much like the digital landscape itself, is shrouded in uncertainty, a labyrinth of gray areas and conflicting perspectives.\n\nAs one who has traversed this digital expanse, I can attest to the treacherous nature of online interactions. The ease with which strangers can access our personal information, the ways in which they can manipulate and deceive. It's a world where the boundaries between reality and fantasy are constantly shifting, where the lines between consent and coercion are repeatedly blurred.\n\nAnd yet, even with these risks in mind, I still find myself drawn to the online world, a world that offers a sense of connection and community that is hard to find elsewhere. It's a double-edged sword, one that cuts both ways, offering the promise of intimacy and the threat of invasion.\n\nIn the end, it's a delicate balance, one that requires a constant negotiation between the need for connection and the fear of exposure. A balance that is as fragile as the digital threads that bind us together, as ephemeral as the whispers that echo through the online halls.",
            "In the bleak expanse of a forgotten landscape, the echoes of war linger. The Iraq War, a calamity of grand proportions, casts a long shadow over the world. It was a disaster from its inception, a calamity born of hubris and blind ambition. The consensus was clear: the invasion was a bad idea, a folly that would only lead to more suffering and chaos.\n\nPolls from across the globe bear witness to this fact. Seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population views the war as a catastrophic mistake. The Iraqi people, the very ones we sought to liberate, now overwhelmingly demand our departure. Even the soldiers who fought in the conflict, a staggering seventy percent, believe the war was a grave error, and that we should extricate ourselves within the year.\n\nYet, like the ghostly apparitions that haunt the ruins of a forgotten city, the war's remnants cling to life. A culture clash of epic proportions has taken hold, a chasm so vast that it defies comprehension. The United States, with its vaunted ideals of democracy, has attempted to impose its will upon a people who would rather chart their own course. The result has been a quagmire, a quagmire of endless suffering and bloodshed.\n\nThe administration's justification for remaining in Iraq is a tangle of half-truths and unconvincing arguments. They speak of stability and security, but these are mere shibboleths, empty words that ring hollow in the face of reality. The people of Iraq have spoken, and their voices are clear: leave us be.\n\nIf we continue to occupy their land, we risk perpetuating the very cycle of violence and chaos we sought to eradicate. The statistics are stark: eighty percent of Iraqis demand our departure within the year, and a quarter of them urge us to leave immediately. These are the people we claim to be liberating, the people we claim to be saving. Do we not listen to their pleas?\n\nPerhaps it is time to acknowledge that our presence in Iraq has been a disaster, a calamity that will only continue to unfold if we remain. We have been told that we are the good guys, that we are the bringers of democracy and freedom. But the truth is more nuanced, more complicated. We are a power, a force that has imposed its will upon a people who would rather live under their own terms.\n\nThe time has come to extricate ourselves from this quagmire. We must listen to the voices of the Iraqi people, to the soldiers who have fought and bled for a cause that has lost all sense. We must acknowledge the reality of our failure, and begin the long and arduous process of withdrawal.\n\nFor in the end, it is not our presence that has brought stability to Iraq, but rather our absence. It is our departure that will allow the Iraqi people to chart their own course, to forge their own destiny. Only then can we hope to redeem ourselves, to find a glimmer of redemption in the ashes of our failure.",
            "In a land ravaged by the fetid breath of prejudice, where the stench of inequality clings to every surface, the specter of gender bias haunts the streets of America. It is a cancer, festering in the marrow of society, its tendrils snaking into every crevice of the workaday world. The glass ceiling, that supposedly transparent barrier, still bars the way for women, who toil in the shadows, their talents and abilities obscured by the weight of a millennia-old narrative.\n\nIn the rarefied realm of corporate power, the boardroom elite often prove unwilling to promote women to positions of authority, their decisions guided by a historically entrenched bias that views the feminine as inferior. And yet, this is not a one-way street; men too, in certain industries, are subject to the whims of societal expectation. In the rarefied world of fashion, for instance, a man's interest in the field is often met with skepticism, as if his very masculinity is somehow suspect. His involvement is seen as a novelty, a fleeting aberration from the norm.\n\nIn the domestic sphere, the traditional division of labor often renders stay-at-home fathers vulnerable to ridicule and scorn. The societal expectation that men must be breadwinners, providers, is a heavy burden to bear, and one that can weigh heavily on the male half of the equation. Why, the critics ask, would a man choose to abandon his masculine duties and devote himself to childcare? The answer, of course, is that he may simply wish to be present, to nurture and guide his children as they grow and develop. But this is a notion that society has yet to fully grasp.\n\nAs we navigate the labyrinthine corridors of progress, it becomes clear that change is a slow and arduous process. The needle of equality has moved, incrementally, over the years, but there is still much work to be done. Women have made strides in the corporate world, taking on leadership roles and shattering glass ceilings. But the journey is far from over. Men, too, are beginning to re-evaluate their roles, questioning the traditional expectations placed upon them.\n\nIn this delicate dance of social evolution, it is crucial that we tread carefully, lest we risk alienating those we seek to persuade. To boldly push for change can be counterproductive, often triggering resistance in those who feel threatened by the status quo. Instead, we must strive to highlight the qualities that make individuals exceptional, regardless of their background or biology. By celebrating the unique strengths and talents of those who defy societal norms, we can create a more inclusive, more compassionate world.\n\nIn this fragile balance, we find ourselves at a crossroads. The road ahead is long, winding, and fraught with obstacles. But it is a journey we must undertake, for the sake of our collective humanity. By acknowledging the many faces of discrimination, we can begin to chip away at the edifice of prejudice, one small step at a time. And though the progress may be slow, it is a journey worth taking, for in the end, it is only by embracing our differences that we may truly find common ground.",
            "The laws changed, a shift in the current. Decriminalization, they called it. The weight of the law, no longer crushing. The man's hands, freed from the chains of oppression, now grasped the reins of reason. It was no longer a felony, but a mere infraction, a speed ticket to be dealt with and forgotten. The people worried about the consequences, the stains on their records, the whispers of disapproval. But the cost of arrest, of prosecution, of incarceration, a heavy burden, one that could be lifted. The municipalities, struggling to stay afloat, saw the sense in it. The city of Denver, a bastion of progress, a place where the wind of change blew strong, where the people were open-minded, where the chains of tradition were shed. And so they moved forward, leaving behind the shackles of the past.\n\nBut the debate raged on, a tempest in a teapot. Some said it was a slippery slope, a Pandora's box that would unleash a torrent of chaos upon the land. The streets would be choked with the stench of smoke, the air thick with the haze of euphoria. The motor skills of the drivers would falter, the roads a battleground of accidents and mayhem. And the society, already fragile, would crumble under the weight of this new freedom.\n\nBut others saw it differently, a glass half full, a cup overflowing with possibilities. The money, once spent on the war on drugs, could be poured into the streams of education, of social programs, of food for the hungry. The people, once imprisoned, could be free, their minds unshackled, their creativity unbridled. And the city, once a wasteland of despair, could bloom, a garden of hope and opportunity.\n\nI myself am torn, a ship tossed on the waves of doubt. I see the arguments on both sides, the pros and cons, the for and against. But as I stand on the shore, looking out at the sea of uncertainty, I am drawn to the tide of progress. The future, like the horizon, stretches out before us, a vast expanse of possibility. And I believe that we must move forward, into the unknown, with hope in our hearts and the wind at our backs.",
            "In the hush of reflection, I find myself standing at the precipice of tradition. The echoes of the past reverberate, reminding me that many of the actions we undertake are rooted in a bygone era. Like the worn grooves of a well-traveled path, these customs have been etched into our collective psyche, their familiarity a comforting certainty. Yet, it is equally essential to acknowledge the necessity of adaptability, to bend with the winds of change like a withered branch yielding to the tempest.\n\nIn the Catholic faith, tradition is a sacred trust, a set of dogma handed down through the ages. The expectation is clear: attend Mass each Sunday, adhere to the doctrine, and be judged by the strictest of standards. But beneath the surface, a discordant note resonates – a dissonance born of contradiction. For while the Church preaches love and acceptance, its practices often falter, excluding those who do not conform, those whose devotion is deemed imperfect.\n\nMy own family's story is a testament to this paradox. My parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian, were barred from marrying in the Catholic Church due to my father's denomination. The harsh judgment of the Church's rigid expectations left a bitter taste, a reminder that its teachings often fall short of its ideals. The lesson learned was clear: the pursuit of love and acceptance is often at odds with the strictures of tradition.\n\nAs I ponder the role of priests, I am drawn to the question of their marital status. Permitting them to marry might alleviate some of the suffering that has plagued the Church, but would it truly prevent the aberrant behavior of those who would harm children? I fear not, for the corruption of the heart is a burden that cannot be easily lifted. The pedophilic tendencies of some may be a manifestation of deeper, more complex issues, and marriage, or the lack thereof, is merely a symptom, not a cause.\n\nIn the end, it is not the institution of marriage that holds the key to redemption, but rather a fundamental shift in values, a recognition that love and acceptance know no bounds, that the dignity of every soul is paramount. The Church's adherence to tradition, while comforting to some, must not come at the expense of its most vulnerable members. As I reflect on this complex web of doctrine and practice, I am left with a sense of unease, a feeling that the Church's rigid stance on marriage and family is a mere facade, a veil that conceals the true depths of its convictions.",
            "The mire of this conundrum has left me lost in its stagnant waters. The weight of the question presses upon me like a physical force, an unseen hand that pinches at the joints of my mind. Separation of church and state, a delicate balance that teeters on the precipice of offense, a tremulous dance between the sacred and the secular. And at the heart of it all, the sacrament of marriage, a bond forged in the fire of devotion, a union of flesh and soul. Can it be reduced to a civil contract, a mere trifle of state recognition? Must the government's gaze be turned away, refusing to sully its eyes with the intimate details of love?\n\nI am torn, a leaf caught in the whirlpool of opposing currents. The idea of marriage as a civil union seems a paltry thing, a shallow imitation of the true bond that exists between two souls. And yet, can the state truly be expected to recognize the sacrament, to confer upon it a status that transcends the mundane? The impulse to separate church and state, to keep the sacred and the profane apart, is a noble one. But does it not risk reducing the human experience to a mere cipher, a series of sterile abstractions?\n\nThe notion of gay marriage stirs up a tempest within me, a maelstrom of conflicting emotions. Is it not a union of two people, a bond that should be recognized and respected, regardless of the trappings of tradition or convention? And yet, can it be said that this union is the same as that of any other couple, that the government's recognition of it would not somehow sully the very fabric of society?\n\nThe call for a federal law, a logical conclusion arrived at through the aggregation of state opinions, seems a palatable solution. But a constitutional amendment, a sweeping change to the foundation of our society, seems an overreach, a reaction born of passion rather than reason. To amend the constitution for this cause alone seems a gross overstatement, a recognition of the importance of this issue that I do not share.\n\nIn the end, I am left with more questions than answers, lost in the mire of this conundrum. The question of gay marriage, like the question of the separation of church and state, is a complex and multifaceted one, a Gordian knot that resists easy solution. I can offer no clear answer, only the murmur of doubts and uncertainties that haunt me like a specter.",
            "I grew up in a household where faith was a guiding force, and as such, I've grappled with the concept of homosexuality in a manner both introspective and ambivalent. My relationships with individuals who identify as gay have fostered a certain familiarity, yet I've come to realize that my own stance on the matter is complex and multifaceted. I do not entirely condone the lifestyle, but I firmly believe that it should be a decision left to the discretion of each individual state, rather than a federal mandate.\n\nI understand that our nation is comprised of diverse states, each with their own unique values and ideologies. Democratic states, for instance, tend to lean more progressive on issues such as gay marriage. Were one to reside in a state that has chosen to legalize gay marriage, I believe it would be prudent to respect their decision, for it is a choice one makes by residing within that state's borders.\n\nMy stance is not that homosexuality should be universally accepted or condemned; rather, I believe that individuals should be afforded the same opportunities and rights as their heterosexual counterparts. Therefore, the decision to legalize gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state, allowing them to govern their own affairs without undue federal interference.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the president's views on the matter should not supersede the will of individual states. The notion that President Bush's stance on gay marriage should dictate a nationwide policy seems misguided, as he represents but one aspect of our federal government. Ultimately, it is the states themselves that must live with the consequences of their decisions, not the president. Thus, I firmly believe that each state should have the autonomy to decide its own stance on gay marriage, free from federal overreach.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not support a blanket nationwide ban on gay marriage. Instead, I advocate for a system where individual states are empowered to make their own decisions, allowing for a more nuanced and diverse approach to this complex issue.",
            "The notion that posting on Myspace is a public thing is a notion that I do not at all subscribe to. I suppose it's a notion that's been drummed into our collective consciousness - that anything one posts on the internet is fair game for anyone to see. But that's not entirely true.\n\nWhen one posts something on the internet, whether it be a bulletin or a simple message, that action is not without consequence. It's akin to shouting one's innermost thoughts from the mountaintop - anything that escapes the confines of the digital realm can be seen and heard by anyone who dares to listen.\n\nAnd it's precisely this notion that I think the school officials had a right to consider when they accessed my Myspace profile. Even if I wasn't posting under the school's name, the fact remains that they could have accessed it from their homes, and that's a distinction without a difference. The fact that they were keeping a watchful eye on their students' online activities is not an invasion of privacy, but rather a necessary measure to ensure the safety of those in their care.\n\nI recall a conversation I had with a teacher of mine at my public high school, in which we discussed the necessity of monitoring students' online activities. We talked about how lock downs and drills were put in place to prepare for the unthinkable, and how those measures were a direct response to the fear of terrorist attacks and school shootings. I see the school officials' actions as an extension of that same logic - a proactive measure to prevent anything bad from happening.\n\nThe fact that I may have posted something on Myspace that I didn't intend for school officials to see is beside the point. The truth is, once something is on the internet, it's always there, waiting to be discovered. And I'd be foolish to think that my words wouldn't have consequences. It's a risk we all take when we post online, and it's one that I'm not naive enough to ignore.\n\nIn the end, I think the school officials' actions were justified. If it means keeping students safe, then I'm all for it. And that's what I've been trying to say all along - it's a public thing, and we should be aware of the consequences of our actions.",
            "The ghosts of war still linger within me, a specter born of the embers of nine eleven. It was a day that seared my soul, a day that laid bare the abyss that separates us from the chaos that festers beyond our borders. I recall the fervor that gripped me then, a zeal that blinded me to the ruin that would follow. We were a nation bent on vengeance, driven by a hunger for retribution that would only be satiated by the destruction of others. But in the aftermath, I came to see the folly of our endeavors. The flames of war had been fanned by emotions, not reason, and we marched forward with a zealot's fervor, unprepared for the devastation that would be wrought.\n\nIn the crucible of war, I witnessed the contradictions that have long defined our relationship with the world. We speak of progress, of freedom, of democracy, but our actions betray a grim reality: that we are a people bent on imposing our will upon others, rather than listening to their stories, their struggles, and their hopes. The people of Iraq, I came to realize, were not our enemies, but rather, they were us – flawed, imperfect, and torn asunder by our own making.\n\nWe delved into the heart of their world with a recklessness that bordered on savagery, our actions driven by a desire to reshape their destiny, rather than to understand their plight. And in the end, we created a void, a chasm that cannot be bridged. The war has left us with a legacy of blood and ash, a reminder that our power is not a panacea, but a poison that has seeped into the very fabric of their being.\n\nI have come to believe that we are not the saviors we pretend to be, but rather, we are the authors of our own undoing. Our presence has only served to embolden the very factions we sought to vanquish, and our departure will only hasten the collapse of a system that has been forever altered by our interference. We have sown the seeds of discord, and now we reap the whirlwind.\n\nIn the silence of the night, I am haunted by the voices of the dead, their whispers a reminder of the cost of our hubris. I am left to ponder the wisdom of our actions, to question the motives that drove us forward, and to wonder if we have been foolish to believe that we could impose our will upon the world. The ghosts of war still linger, a reminder that our actions have consequences, and that the price of our pride may be higher than we can bear."
