            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In a world beset by the rot of tradition, the Catholic Church stands as a testament to the unyielding grip of the past. Its views, once a guiding light in the darkness, now seem antiquated, a relic of a bygone era. The hemorrhage of followers, a slow and insidious bleed, threatens to consume the very fabric of the institution. The reasons for this decline are manifold, a tangled web of resistance to change and an unyielding adherence to dogma.\n\nThe Church's stance on matters of the human heart, the most intimate and private of concerns, has proven a barrier to those who would seek a more inclusive and compassionate path. The intolerance of gay marriage, the prohibition on abortion, the recalcitrant opposition to birth control – all have contributed to a sense of isolation, a feeling of being an outsider within one's own faith. The Church's views, once a source of comfort and guidance, now seem cold and unforgiving, a reminder of the distance between the hallowed halls of power and the humble, the marginalized, and the oppressed.\n\nIn an age of rapid transformation, the Church's inflexibility has become a liability, a liability that threatens to extinguish the flame of faith in the hearts of the faithful. The whisper of doubt, once a gentle breeze, has grown to a deafening roar, as the faithful question the relevance of an institution that seems more concerned with maintaining the status quo than with serving the needs of its people.\n\nThe call for reform, a quiet murmur at first, has grown to a cacophony of voices, a chorus of those who demand a more inclusive, more compassionate Church. The ordination of women, the marriage of priests – these are not revolutionary ideas, but rather a return to the sensibilities of a bygone era, a time when the Church was not afraid to adapt, to evolve, and to grow. The notion that priests are \"married\" to God, that their devotion is a singular, all-consuming passion, is a romantic notion, one that ignores the fundamental human need for connection, for love, and for community.\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between the sacred and the secular are increasingly blurred, the Catholic Church finds itself struggling to maintain its relevance. Its views, once a beacon of hope, now seem a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of the dangers of dogma, of the perils of an institution that prioritizes doctrine over compassion, tradition over innovation.\n\nAs the faithful continue to question, to doubt, and to seek, the Church must confront the mirror of its own reflection, must confront the possibility that its views, its traditions, and its very way of life may be irreparably damaged. The choice is clear: adapt, evolve, and grow, or risk being consumed by the very darkness it once sought to illuminate.",
            "In the desolate expanse of my thought, a notion stirs, a notion that I've come to regard with a certain measure of conviction. The idea that two individuals of the same sex should be denied the right to partake in the sacrament of marriage, that they should be prohibited from committing to one another, strikes me as a void in the fabric of our existence. It is a chasm, a crevice that yawns open, revealing the brutal indifference of the universe. I do not believe, nor can I fathom, that a person's innate orientation is a decision forged in the crucible of choice, but rather a sacred geometry that shapes their essence.\n\nTo hold them accountable for what they are, to condemn them for the contours of their being, is a folly of unyielding cruelty. It is a condemnation that says more about us, about our own frailties and fears, than it does about the individuals we seek to condemn. We are wont to say that we are born straight, that our inclinations are a given, an immutable truth. And yet, we deny this fundamental truth to those whose inclinations differ from our own. It is a hypocrisy, a flagrant display of our own self-interest.\n\nI do not pretend to possess a profound understanding of the issue, nor do I claim to be immune to the tumult of my own emotions. However, I do know this: the federal government has no business in the innermost recesses of our lives, no right to dictate the nature of our relationships. It is a matter of personal liberty, a fundamental human right that should be safeguarded, not infringed upon. We must not permit the state to sully the sanctity of love, to reduce the most intimate bonds between two individuals to a mere abstraction, a legal nicety.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of morality, nor is it a question of national security. It is a question of basic humanity. We are not gods, nor are we the arbiters of what constitutes a just and moral society. We are but fleeting, fragile creatures, stumbling through the darkness, seeking connection, seeking solace in the face of an uncaring universe. To deny another their fundamental right to love, to be loved, is to surrender to the void, to acquiesce to the brutal indifference that lies at the heart of existence.\n\nAnd so, I stand firm in my conviction, a conviction born of a deep-seated empathy, a recognition of the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of their orientation. It is a conviction that I hold dear, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of compassion. And I will not falter, for in the end, it is not I who will be judged, but the universe itself, for its capacity to create and destroy, to bring forth life and snuff out the flame of hope.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a world beset by the whims of others, there exists a notion that has come to plague our collective conscience - the legalization of gay marriage. A union that defies the conventional norms, a bond that transcends the boundaries of societal expectations. And yet, it is this very notion that has sparked a fire of fervent debate, a maelstrom of opinions that threaten to consume us all.\n\nBut let us not be swayed by the tempests of fear and ignorance. Let us instead seek to understand the essence of this issue, to peel away the layers of misconception and reveal the truth that lies beneath. For it is in the quiet moments of introspection, when the din of the world fades into the background, that we may come to realize the inherent equality of all human relationships.\n\nThe notion that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family is a specious one, a canard born of prejudice and fear. For what is a family, truly, but a union of two individuals bound together by love and commitment? Is it not the same bond that exists between two people of the same sex, a bond that is strengthened by the trials and tribulations of life? The idea that such a bond is somehow less valid, less worthy of recognition, is a notion that defies the very fabric of our humanity.\n\nAnd yet, it is this notion of recognition that has become a central tenet of the debate. The struggle for gay marriage is not about the right to be married in a church, but about the right to be recognized by the state, to have one's relationship validated by the very institution that governs our society. It is a matter of civil rights, of equality under the law.\n\nBut equality, it seems, is a concept that is fraught with peril. For in a world where some are bound by the strictures of tradition and faith, the idea of equality can be seen as a threat, a challenge to the status quo. And so, we are met with the specter of opposition, the argument that gay marriage is somehow morally wrong, that it goes against the teachings of certain religious groups.\n\nBut what of the morality of the majority? Is it not hypocritical to impose one's own moral code on others, to create laws that enforce a particular set of values on an entire country? Is it not the duty of government to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation? The controversy over the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance is a telling example of this very issue, a reminder that our government has a long history of reconciling the competing interests of different groups.\n\nAnd yet, despite the progress we have made, there remain those who cling to outdated notions of morality, who see gay people as somehow damaged or defective. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against these claims, citing the overwhelming evidence that contradicts them. But still, the voices of ignorance and fear persist, a reminder that our journey towards equality is far from over.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of morality, but of humanity. It is not a question of what is right or wrong, but of what is just. And so, let us strive to see the world in a different light, to recognize the inherent value of all human relationships, regardless of their orientation. Let us strive to create a world where all are equal, where all are valued and respected. For in the end, it is not the laws that we pass, but the love that we share, that will truly set us free.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy, I stood as a summer's sentinel, a guardian of pills and potions. The proscription of certain substances, I've come to realize, does not necessarily negate their utility. There are remedies, after all, that the law deems illicit yet prove invaluable in the realm of healing. Oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets - all these and more, though contraband, are sanctioned for their efficacy. And yet, when it comes to the verdant leaf, the stigmatic label of illegality seems to render its virtues moot.\n\nBut is it not paradoxical that we valorize certain poisons while condemning a plant whose benefits we've yet to fully grasp? A weed, some might say, whose allure lies in its illegitimacy. Yet, I propose we shed the shroud of taboo that shrouds it, that we might uncover its true nature. The fact remains that it holds within it potential - a potential to heal, to soothe, to bring solace to the afflicted.\n\nIts potency, like that of alcohol, can be abused. But does this render it an object of revulsion? No, for it is the manner of consumption that must be considered, not the substance itself. Gradual integration, perhaps, could be the key. A measured approach, one that acknowledges the plant's potential while safeguarding against its misuse.\n\nWe've been conditioned to view it as a pariah, a substance to be feared and maligned. The truth, however, lies in the middle ground - a realm where its beneficial properties can be harnessed, where its use is guided by reason and restraint. Only then can we begin to grasp the true essence of the leaf, to see it for what it is: a tool, a key to unlocking the secrets of the human body.\n\nIn this, I see a glimmer of hope. A chance to redeem the tarnished reputation of an herb whose virtues have been obscured by the shadows of misconception.",
            "In this changed world, where the hallowed halls of the church now ring with the faint whispers of progress, I find myself a stranger, wandering through the shadows of a once-familiar place. The church, a bastion of tradition, has adapted to the rhythms of the twenty-first century, its stern visage softened by the gentle winds of time. Gone are the days of rigid adherence, of Sunday finery and matching accessories; now, the pews are filled with the casual attire of a more modern era. The sacred rituals, too, have been streamlined, reduced to a mere thirty minutes of devotional time. In the summer, parishioners arrive from the beach, their beachwear a testament to the church's newfound informality. Even the morning masses, once a bastion of formal elegance, now see the faithful dressed in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the somber attire of yesteryear.\n\nAs I navigate this new landscape, I am struck by the superficial changes that have taken place. The church, once a fortress of orthodoxy, now seems to have lost some of its rigor. The politics, the intrigue, the shadowy machinations that once lurked in the recesses of the church's halls – all these remain shrouded in mystery. But one thing is certain: the institution has evolved, its traditions yielding to the tides of time.\n\nRegarding the scourge of pedophilia that has besmirched the good name of the Catholic Church, I must confess that I do not believe that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these heinous crimes. The affliction of pedophilia is a twisted aspect of human nature, one that cannot be legislated away or rectified by changes in the church's dogma. Men, even those bound by vows of chastity, can still succumb to their baser impulses. The relative handful of faiths that permit their clergy to marry have not eliminated the problem; rather, they have simply pushed it into the shadows, where it festers unseen.\n\nIn my view, the notion that the church could have prevented these atrocities by altering its rules is a naive one. Pedophilia is a manifestation of a deeper, more primal force – one that is rooted in the very fabric of human nature. It is a beast that cannot be tamed by the church's laws or dogma. If the institution had been aware of these abuses and chose to cover them up, then shame indeed be upon it. But to assume that a change in the church's policies would have eradicated the problem is to misunderstand the fundamental nature of humanity.\n\nAs I reflect on the Catholic Church, I am left with a sense of melancholy, a feeling that the institution, once a beacon of hope and faith, has been tarnished by the very darkness it sought to vanquish. Yet, even in the face of these failings, I remain hopeful that the church will one day rediscover its moral compass, and that it will emerge, phoenix-like, from the ashes of its own failure.",
            "In the charred and barren expanse of the American psyche, a festering wound had been opened by the twin scythes of deception and bloodlust. The September 11th attacks, a crucible of pain and terror, had been seized upon by those who would wield the power of the state like a scimitar, slicing through the Constitution and the very fabric of truth. The Bush administration, with its hubris and mendacity, had woven a tapestry of lies, connecting Saddam Hussein to the terror of that dread day, a threadbare pretext for the invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe Bush administration's hand had been heavy with malice, crushing the truth beneath its heel, even as Colin Powell, that erstwhile champion of the lie, now confessed to a lack of conviction in the evidence he presented to the UN. The stench of malfeasance hung in the air, an impeachable offense that had yet to be acknowledged.\n\nThe Constitution, that sacred document, had been repeatedly defiled, trampled beneath the feet of those who would seek to control the narrative, to shape the discourse, and to bend the will of the people to their whim. Since September 11th, the Bush administration had operated with a clear intent to subjugate the Constitution, to reduce it to a mere parchment, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe seeds of war had been sown in the fertile soil of vengeance, the younger Bush's hunger for blood a palpable force, driven by a desire to avenge his father's failures. The true motives, hidden behind a veneer of concern for national security, had been to secure the country's energy interests, a cynical calculus that had been played out in the blood-soaked streets of Iraq.\n\nThe war had dragged on, a cancer that refused to be excised, a festering wound that had claimed countless lives and destroyed the lives of countless more. The instability in the region threatened to boil over, a maelstrom of sectarian violence and tribal strife that had consumed the country.\n\nThe proposed solution, a coalition of surrounding nations, seemed a pale imitation of a remedy, a patchwork solution that would only serve to perpetuate the cycle of violence. The sovereignty of Iraq, a concept that had been so cavalierly disregarded by the occupiers, would continue to be eroded, a slow-motion train wreck that threatened to consume all in its path.\n\nThe Parliament, a puppet regime propped up by foreign powers, struggled to assert its authority, a rudderless ship adrift in a sea of chaos. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, wielded little actual power, as the radical elements of the country continued to vie for control, their machinations a deadly dance of politics and violence.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of this maelstrom, a glimmer of truth remained, a faint flame that flickered in the darkness, a reminder that the people had been lied to, that their trust had been betrayed, and that the truth, though obscured, would eventually emerge, a blazing fire that would consume the perpetrators of this great injustice.",
            "He spoke in halting cadence, as if the words themselves were weights he struggled to lift. The question hung in the air like a challenge, unmet and unspoken. He searched for a foothold, a crumb of certainty to cling to in the dark chasm of his thoughts.\n\nThe War in Iraq. A name that clung to his tongue like a bitter taste. He didn't know where to begin. The threads of his thoughts tangled, knotted, and twisted like the charred remains of a burned forest.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. \"It seems pointless, a hollow drumbeat in the desert wasteland.

It's a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, the words spilling forth like a confession. \"I don't know what the future holds, but I fear we're digging our own grave, a grave of ash and dust and deceit. We're trying to build a democracy, but it's a house of cards, a fragile structure that will crumble beneath the weight of our own hubris.\"\n\nHe fell silent, the words dying on his lips like autumn leaves on a winter breeze. \"I don't know what to think,\" he said finally, his voice a whisper in the void. \"I'm lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty. All I know is that we're stuck, trapped in this endless cycle of violence and bloodshed, and I don't know how to escape.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was heavy, a weight that pressed down upon him like a physical force. He knew he was lost, adrift in a world gone mad, and he feared he might never find his way back to the shore.",
            "The notion of a state imposing its will upon the sacred rituals of the faithful seemed an affront to the fundamental principles of our constitution. The separation of church and state was a cornerstone of our nation's edifice, a bulwark against the tyranny of dogma and the imposition of one creed over another. The constitution itself was replete with the language of liberty, of freedom from the shackles of coercive authority. To tamper with this delicate balance would be to invite a darkness that would soon consume us all.\n\nIn the struggle to define the boundaries of a free people, the churches themselves must be the arbiters of their own destiny. To seek to impose a single interpretation upon the faithful, to dictate the sacred rites and rituals of the marginalized and the minority, was to flout the very principles of religious tolerance that had brought our nation to its knees. The federal government, with its heavy hand and its vainglorious ambitions, must not be allowed to usurp the authority of the churches. It was a prospect too dire, too fraught with peril, to contemplate.\n\nThe framers of our constitution had been wise in their foresight, in their crafting of a document that would safeguard the rights of all, regardless of creed or persuasion. The separation of church and state was not a mere abstraction, a dusty relic of a bygone era, but a living, breathing principle, a bulwark against the ravages of intolerance and oppression. To tamper with this delicate balance would be to invite the very darkness that we sought to vanquish.\n\nThe push for an amendment, driven by personal conviction and a zealot's fervor, was a misguided endeavor, a bitter fruit of the tree of dogma. It was a testament to the dangers of unchecked power, of the corrupting influence that lurked within the hearts of those who would seek to impose their will upon the faithful. The economy, the society, the very fabric of our nation – all would suffer, were we to allow this aberrant power to take hold.\n\nIn the end, it was not the government's role to dictate the sacred rituals of the faithful, but rather to protect the freedom of conscience, to safeguard the delicate balance of power that had been entrusted to us by our forebears. The churches must be left to their own devices, to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. For it was in this fragile dance of power, this delicate balance of freedom and authority, that our nation found its strength, its beauty, and its very soul.",
            "In the desolate landscape of modern politics, the war in Iraq stands as a stark reminder of the hubris of power and the fallibility of human judgment. The government's actions, shrouded in a veil of secrecy and deception, left the American people with a nagging sense of doubt and disillusionment. The invasion, launched in 2003, was predicated on a fragile link between the events of September 11th and the supposed threat posed by Iraq's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, a connection that was tenuous at best.\n\nThe echoes of the Vietnam War seemed to reverberate through the corridors of power, as the US government, blinded by the ghosts of the past, repeated the same mistakes. The war, a protracted and bloody endeavor, claimed countless American lives, its true cost shrouded in the mists of time. The void left by the ousting of the Iraqi government was a chasm of chaos and anarchy, a testament to the government's woeful lack of preparation for the aftermath.\n\nThe notion of implanting democracy in a foreign land, a concept as elusive as the wind, was an endeavor doomed from the start. The parallels with Vietnam were stark: the push for democracy, the removal of a perceived enemy, and the subsequent quagmire of insurgency. The US government, seemingly oblivious to the lessons of history, plunged headlong into the abyss, leaving in its wake a trail of death and destruction.\n\nThe US government's actions, a labyrinth of deceit and manipulation, left the American people with a sense of unease and mistrust. The smoke and mirrors of propaganda, designed to conceal the true nature of the war, only served to fan the flames of dissent and opposition. The war, a Sisyphean task, seemed to drag on interminably, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and sacrifice.\n\nAs the years ticked by, the toll mounted, the lives lost, the futures shattered. The Iraqi people, innocent bystanders in a conflict not of their making, were left to pick up the pieces, to rebuild their shattered lives in a landscape scarred by the ravages of war. The US government, a behemoth of power, seemed deaf to the cries of the victims, its priorities driven by a singular focus on oil and resources.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a legacy of blood and tears, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of humility in the face of the unknown. As the years passed, the rhetoric of the war machine gave way to the cold, harsh reality of its consequences, a reality that would haunt the nation for generations to come.\n\nIn the silence of the night, as the shadows dance upon the wall, one cannot help but wonder: what lies at the heart of this war? Is it a quest for freedom, or a quest for power? The answer, shrouded in the mists of time, remains a mystery, a riddle waiting to be solved.\n\nAnd so, we are left to ponder the question: what is the true cost of war? Is it the lives lost, the families shattered, the futures destroyed? Or is it something more sinister, a cancer that eats away at the very fabric of our society? The war in Iraq, a scar upon the face of history, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of wisdom in the face of uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it is not the war that will be remembered, but the lives that were lost, the dreams that were shattered, and the hope that was extinguished. The war in Iraq, a legacy of blood and tears, will forever be etched in the annals of history as a cautionary tale of the dangers of hubris and the importance of humility in the face of the unknown.",
            "I stumble upon the precipice of this argument, unsure of the footing. The notion of gay marriage, a canvas of conviction held taut by the threads of personal preference. The understanding that human inclination can be a force beyond our control, a biological whisper that echoes through the chambers of our being. To deny this fundamental aspect of our nature, to curtail the rights of those who are bound by the currents of their own desire, is an affront to the very essence of humanity.\n\nIn the depths of our society, there exist pockets of acceptance, of love and companionship that defy the constraints of societal norms. My own neighborhood, a microcosm of the world, is home to couples who walk among us, their love and devotion as palpable as the morning dew. They are not strangers to the quiet routines of domesticity, their dogs walked, their children raised, their lives woven into the fabric of our community.\n\nAnd yet, the forces of oppression seek to impose their will, to rewrite the script of marriage to suit their own narrow vision. The notion that the state, that the church, should dictate the terms of our most intimate relationships, is a travesty. Marriage, a sacrament of love and commitment, should not be subject to the whims of politicians and theologians.\n\nThe science is clear: the very fabric of our being is shaped by the intricate dance of biology and environment. The notion that homosexuality is a choice, a moral failing, is a relic of a bygone era. The evidence is mounting, a chorus of voices that attest to the fundamental humanity of those who are drawn to their own kind.\n\nAnd so, I stand in solidarity with those who would seek to claim their rights, to assert their love and commitment in the face of adversity. Marriage, a union of two souls, should be a private, personal affair, not a public spectacle subject to the whims of the powerful. It is a matter of basic human dignity, a fundamental right that should not be denied.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of politics, but of humanity. A recognition of our shared existence, our capacity for love and compassion. The denial of gay marriage is not just a blow to the rights of a minority, but a affront to the very fabric of our society. It is a reminder that we are not yet the society we claim to be, a society that values freedom, equality, and the pursuit of happiness.",
            "The perils of a world without bounds. When you cast your thoughts into the void, you invite the uninvited to bear witness. The internet, that great and unforgiving expanse, holds all in its gaze. A public forum, a clearing of unspoken truths, where the weight of words can be measured in the hearts of those who read them. As one who has walked the crucible of such a world, I speak from experience. The things you set free into the ether, they do not remain the property of the one who set them free. They are sown, like seeds in the rain, and take root in the minds of others.\n\nIn this wild and uncharted sea, the lines of private and public blur, and the notion of control is but a distant memory. The world is a stranger's gaze, and what you wish to keep hidden, it will find. The example of the school, where whispers in a crowded hallway became a clarion call for caution, serves as a stark reminder of this truth. The internet, that great sieve, filters not for the benefit of the one who casts their words into its depths, but for the benefit of those who would claim dominion over the narrative.\n\nThe boundaries we once knew, the walls that once separated us, are breached. The notion of privacy, that sacred trust, is but a relic of a bygone era. When you put your thoughts into the world, you unleash a force beyond your control. The school officials, those custodians of order, may not have the luxury of cherry-picking what they choose to heed, for the whispers of the internet can be a call to action, a clarion that cannot be ignored.\n\nAnd yet, there is a fine line between prudence and overreach. The teacher who dons a false persona, a mask of anonymity, to peer into the private lives of their students, crosses that line. The same holds true for the residential advisor, who would rather not know the secrets that their charges choose to share in the digital wilderness. The world is a complex tapestry, woven from the threads of our choices, and the internet is but one of its many facets.\n\nIn this vast and bewildering landscape, we must navigate the shoals of our own making. What we put out into the world, it will return to us, like a tide that cannot be stemmed. The only question is, what do we wish to create? The world is a canvas, and our words are the brushstrokes that paint its hue. Let us choose our colors wisely.",
            "The conflagration of war had been a slow burn, consuming all in its path. Its purpose, once a beacon of hope, had long since dwindled to a smoldering ember. We had begun with noble intentions, a crusade to restore democracy to a land shrouded in tyranny. But the flames of our conviction had grown cold, our passion reduced to a mere spark.\n\nThe original spark had been lit by the desire to vanquish a despot, to bring freedom to a people oppressed. Yet, as the fire raged on, our motivations had grown muddled. We had lost sight of the high purpose that had driven us forward, and in its place, a sense of pride and power had taken hold. We fought not for the sake of a higher good, but to prove our own strength, to assert our dominance over the world.\n\nThe ghosts of George Bush's past animosities with Saddam Hussein still lingered, a specter that haunted our decision-making. Had we ever truly been driven by a desire to bring democracy to the people, or had we been swayed by personal vendettas? The flame of our conviction had been tarnished by the weight of our own self-interest.\n\nWe had made our statement in the early days of the conflict, a bold declaration of our intent. But the war had dragged on, a seemingly endless and futile struggle. Year after year, we continued to pour our treasure into a bottomless pit, a drain on our economy and our people. We should have known when to stop, when to acknowledge that our purpose had been lost, and that it was time to let the people of the affected nation fend for themselves.\n\nThe dollars we spent on war could have been better spent on the pressing issues of our own country: poverty, education, healthcare, and the infrastructure that underpins our very way of life. We had been blinded by our own hubris, our desire to assert our dominance clouding our judgment. The war had become a self-perpetuating machine, driven by a desire to prove that we would not be defeated, rather than a genuine desire to bring about positive change.\n\nThe people of our nation were being killed, wounded, and maimed in a conflict that had long since lost its justification. The money we spent on this war could have been better spent on the very issues that plague our own society. It was a reckless extravagance, a squandering of our resources on a lost cause.\n\nAs I see it, the war has been a dismal failure, a tragic exercise in futility. It is time for us to acknowledge this, to recognize that our purpose has been lost, and that it is time to bring our troops home.",
            "The notion of privacy in this brave new world of ours, where the boundaries between the self and the void are increasingly blurred. It's a conundrum, really. We surrender our secrets to the void, hoping to connect with others, only to find ourselves exposed, vulnerable, and at the mercy of those who would seek to do us harm. The internet, a vast and unforgiving expanse, stretches out before us like a desolate wasteland, waiting to swallow our every thought, our every move.\n\nConsider the case of Myspace, that erstwhile bastion of teenage angst and social posturing. If one posts information on such a site, are they not tacitly inviting the world to peer into their innermost recesses? The notion of \"friends\" and \"friends of friends\" is a farce, a mere facade that conceals the true nature of this digital free-for-all. We give permission, willingly or not, for others to see into our lives, to snoop and pry, to form judgments about us based on the most superficial of criteria.\n\nAnd yet, what of the case where someone, driven by a desire to do good, stumbles upon a profile that may potentially prevent a life from being lost? Is it not a cruel fate to deny them the means to act, to intervene, or to prevent a tragedy? But, on the other hand, is it not also a slippery slope, a Pandora's box that, once opened, cannot be closed? We must tread carefully, lest we invite an era of digital surveillance, where the State, or some individual driven by a zealot's fervor, seeks to monitor and control every aspect of our lives.\n\nThe lines are blurred, and the issue is complex. We must acknowledge that, in this digital age, we are never truly alone, that our every move is potentially being watched, monitored, and judged. And yet, we must also recognize that there is a fine line between prudence and paranoia, between a desire to connect and a need to protect ourselves. The world is a vast and messy place, and we must navigate its complexities with care.\n\nAs I sit here, pondering this digital labyrinth, I am reminded of the words of a sage who once said, \"The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.\" But what of those who do travel, who wander the vast expanse of the internet, never truly knowing who is watching, who is waiting, or who will act? We are all of us, in this brave new world, both hunter and hunted, prey and predator, our fates intertwined with the fates of others in ways we cannot fully comprehend.",
            "The weight of the world's duplicity bore down upon him like a shroud, a somber reminder of the futility that had befallen the Iraq War. He hesitated, his words faltering on the precipice of conviction, as he struggled to reconcile his own ambivalence. It was a hypocrisy he couldn't shake, a feeling that had taken root in the desolate landscape of his conscience. \n\nHe thought back to the early days, when the war was still a distant hum in the collective unconscious, a murmur of discontent that threatened to boil over into a fevered pitch of outrage. But now, as the years had worn on like a shroud of ash, it was clear that the war had been a catastrophe from the start. The numbers were stark: 75 to 80 percent of the global population, 80 percent of Iraqis, 70 percent of the troops on the ground – all believed it was a bad idea. A disaster that had unfolded like a dark tapestry, its threads of deceit and hubris inextricably intertwined.\n\nThe administration's obstinacy was a constant reminder of the chasm that yawned between their vision and the harsh realities of the Middle East. They had sought to impose their will upon a region that refused to be shaped by their ideals. The clash of cultures was a gulf too wide to bridge, a chasm that had swallowed countless dreams of democracy and left only rubble in its wake.\n\nHe thought of Saddam, a fallen tyrant, and wondered if the ends had justified the means. Had the invasion been worth the cost in blood and treasure? The question hung in the air like a specter, its answer as elusive as the shifting sands of the desert. \n\nHe couldn't help but feel that the administration's persistence was a form of madness, a refusal to acknowledge the truth that had been apparent from the start. The problems of withdrawal were real, but so were the problems of staying. And yet, as he weighed the pros and cons, he couldn't find a compelling reason to justify the continued occupation.\n\nIn the end, it came down to a simple truth: the Iraqi people had spoken, and their voices were clear. They wanted the United States to leave, to extricate itself from the quagmire of its own making. If the administration couldn't hear their pleas, then perhaps it was time to take a step back and listen to the whispers of history. For in the end, it was the Iraqi people who would inherit the consequences of this war, and it was their voices that should be heard above the din of justification and rationalization.\n\nHe fell silent, his words spent, his thoughts trailing off into the desert wind like the ashes of a forgotten city. The Iraq War was a reminder that sometimes, even the most well-intentioned actions can unleash a maelstrom of chaos and destruction. And sometimes, the only way to begin the process of healing is to acknowledge the mistakes of the past, and to let go of the weight of our own hubris.",
            "In the wasteland of societal norms, a glass ceiling still hangs, shrouding the dreams of women. It is a barrier that has long been a part of our collective unconscious, a stain that refuses to fade. Though we have made strides, though we have come a long way, the struggle persists. The weight of history bears down upon us, a crushing force that seeks to keep women in their place. And yet, it is not just women who suffer. Men too are bound by the chains of expectation, forced to conform to roles that are predetermined by a society that values productivity over humanity.\n\nIn the fields of work, a man's worth is often measured by his ability to provide, to be the breadwinner. And so, when a man chooses to stay at home, to tend to his children and nurture his family, he is met with scorn and suspicion. \"Why are you not working?\" the question hangs in the air, a judgment that seeks to pierce the soul. And in the fashion industry, where aesthetics reign supreme, a man's seriousness is often called into question. Can he truly understand the nuances of fashion, or is he simply a poseur, a man playing at being something he is not?\n\nWe are a society in flux, slowly shedding the skin of our prejudices, but the process is glacial. It is a battle that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to confront the darkness within ourselves. We must acknowledge the glass ceiling, the walls that divide us, and work to shatter them. We must promote the qualities that make us human, that make us worthy of respect, regardless of our gender or background. But we must do so with subtlety, with a light touch, lest we provoke resistance and reinforce the very prejudices we seek to overcome.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, a dance between progress and pushback. And yet, I believe we are at a turning point, a moment when the tide is shifting in our favor. Women are rising to positions of power, their voices being heard, their stories being told. And men, too, are beginning to question the status quo, to challenge the expectations that have been placed upon them. It is a slow process, but it is one that will ultimately lead to a more just and equitable society, one where all individuals are free to be themselves, without fear of judgment or reprisal.",
            "The world had changed its laws, yet nothing had changed. They'd decriminalized it, but that was not the same as making it right. It was a distinction without a difference, a nuance lost on the wind. The law still weighed heavy, its chains still binding, though now they were forged of paper and ink rather than iron and steel. A ticket now, rather than a cell, the punishment for those who dared to transgress. But the consequences lingered, like the stench of a rotting carcass, long after the initial blow had been struck.\n\nThe future, a minefield of uncertainty, where one wrong step could lead to ruin. The whispers of the past, echoes of a lifetime's mistakes, still lingered, a constant reminder of the perils of indulgence. And yet, the argument of expediency held weight - the cost of incarceration, the drain on resources, the weight of bureaucracy, all these things whispered sweet nothings in the ears of those who would cut corners.\n\nBut in a place like Denver, where the winds of change blew strong, where the people were open and liberal in their thinking, the law had been rewritten, and the city had reaped the benefits. Money freed from the shackles of prohibition had flowed into the streets, into the schools, into the hands of those who needed it most. The homeless, the elderly, all had benefited from the new order.\n\nAnd yet, as with all things, there were those who saw the darkness beneath the surface. The idea of a society where marijuana was as ubiquitous as cigarettes, where its use was as casual as a drink on a Friday night, was a prospect that filled them with unease. The taboo had been broken, but the fear remained, a lingering sense of unease that lingered long after the law had been rewritten.\n\nBut the truth was, no two people reacted the same to the substance, just as no two people reacted the same to the world around them. Some were torn apart, their minds shattered by the experience, while others were barely touched. And so, the debate raged on, a never-ending cycle of argument and counter-argument, as humanity struggled to understand the nature of the beast they had unleashed.\n\nIn the end, it was not the law that mattered, but the individual, and how they chose to wield their own power. Moderation, excess, the line between was a thin one, a knife's edge that separated the wise from the foolhardy. And so, the debate continued, a never-ending struggle to understand the nature of the world, and our place within it.",
            "I'd say yes. It's a case of tradition's wearied hand guiding their steps. They move through the days in a manner that's been practiced for an eternity - the same rituals, the same routines. And in that repetition lies a certain comfort, a sense of rootedness in a world that's grown increasingly foreign. But alongside this adherence to tradition must come a willingness to bend with the winds of change. For in its rigidity, the Church can be a heavy chain that binds, stifling the very spirit it seeks to nourish.\n\nI think of my own experiences with this dichotomy. My parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian respectively, were never wed in the Catholic Church due to my father's faith. It was a decision that left a bitter taste in my mouth, and one that I couldn't shake the feeling was a affront to the very principle of love and acceptance that the Church espouses. Why, if we're to love one another unconditionally, must we turn away from those who don't conform to our narrow creed? It's a paradox that has long plagued me, and one that I fear is inherent in the Church's very fabric.\n\nAnd yet, I'm not convinced that the institution would be fundamentally changed by allowing priests to marry. The rot of pedophilia runs deep, a cancer that's impossible to excise with a simple reform. The act of marriage, or the lack thereof, is a mere symptom of a far greater malaise. If a man is consumed by his baser impulses, he'll find a way to act upon them, regardless of his station. It's a truth that's both grim and inescapable.\n\nNo, I fear that the true issue lies not in the rules and regulations, but in the hearts of those who would seek to do harm. And it's a darkness that will not be vanquished by grand gestures or sweeping reforms.",
            "I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this issue, uncertain of the path to follow. The lines blur between the separation of church and state, the definition of marriage a snare that ensnares all who dare to tread. It is a minefield of opposing views, each side a jagged rock waiting to rend the unwary.\n\nIt is a topic of darkness, a void that yawns wide, drawing in the unwary with its siren song of simplicity. Marriage, a sacrament of the heart, a bond between two souls, or is it merely a civil union, a contract forged in the cold fire of state and law? The government, a behemoth that brooks no dissent, seeks to stamp its seal upon the union, to bestow its blessings, or damn its curse.\n\nI dare not take a stance, lest I be seen as a heretic, a blasphemer, or a saint. For in this wilderness of competing claims, I find no clear path to follow. The church and state, two titans locked in eternal combat, each seeking to impose its will upon the other. The constitution, a sacred text, a document of freedom, or a framework for tyranny? A constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, a clarion call to arms, or a mere expedient, a tool of the powerful?\n\nI am but a traveler in this desert, a wanderer in the void, lost and alone. I know not which path to take, nor which side to choose. The issue of gay marriage, a mere symptom of the larger disease, a cancer that infects our society, a plague that gnaws at the very fabric of our being.\n\nLet the states, those bastions of freedom, those citadels of liberty, come to a consensus, a logical conclusion, a decision born of reason and compassion. Let them forge a path, a beacon of hope, a shining light in the darkness. But let us not amend the constitution, that sacred text, that document of our highest aspirations, to ban a union that is but a mere shadow of the love and commitment that it represents.\n\nNo, let us not be swayed by the passions of the moment, let us not be led astray by the siren song of ideology. Let us seek the truth, the wisdom, the compassion that lies at the heart of this issue. For in the end, it is not about the constitution, nor the church, nor the state. It is about the human heart, that vast and mysterious organ, that beating drum of love and compassion that pulses through us all.",
            "In the void of conviction, I find myself lost between the certainties of my upbringing and the complexities of the world around me. Raised in a home steeped in Christian tradition, I've struggled to reconcile the beauty of love with the strictures of doctrine. Gay relationships, for me, have always been a nuanced and multifaceted issue, one that defies easy categorization. My friendships with individuals from the LGBTQ+ community have only deepened this sentiment, forcing me to confront the gray areas that exist between faith and acceptance.\n\nLike many, I've come to believe that gay marriage should be a matter for individual states to decide. The notion of a centralized authority dictating the terms of love and commitment seems antithetical to the principles of democracy. The diversity of our nation, with its mix of red and blue states, only underscores the need for local decision-making on this issue.\n\nIn democratic states, where the majority has spoken on the matter, it seems reasonable to respect their will. However, this does not preclude the right of other states to chart their own course. Why should the president, who may not reside in these states, impose his will upon them? It is the people, not the executive branch, who should decide the fate of gay marriage in their communities.\n\nI firmly believe that individuals from the LGBTQ+ community deserve the same opportunities and rights as their heterosexual counterparts. To deny them this is to perpetuate a system of inequality. By allowing each state to decide for itself, we empower local leaders to create a more inclusive and just society.\n\nIn this context, the role of the president becomes increasingly irrelevant. The ban on gay marriage, imposed by President Bush, seems an outdated and misguided policy. As the country moves forward, it is the people, not the executive branch, who will ultimately determine the course of history. By granting states the autonomy to decide on gay marriage, we ensure that the will of the people is respected and that love knows no bounds.\n\nUltimately, my position on this issue is guided by a desire for inclusivity and a recognition of the complexities that surround us. By embracing the gray areas, rather than trying to impose simplistic solutions, we can create a more just and compassionate society for all.",
            "The notion that one's words are their own to wield has long been a fleeting deception. The unforgiving vastness of the digital sphere has stripped us of our most intimate thoughts, rendering them public property. Myspace, a platform born of the same impulse to connect, has become a repository of our most private selves. The lines between public and private have grown indistinct, with consequences that are both far-reaching and inescapable.\n\nIf one posts their thoughts on the internet, they must reckon with the certainty that others will see them. School officials, with their authority to monitor and moderate, are no exception. They may not have been directly privy to the school's name, but the internet's labyrinthine pathways allow them to uncover secrets hidden behind the façade of anonymity. In the pursuit of a safer school environment, their actions, though invasive, may be justified. By tracking students' online activities, they aim to prevent the very real threat of harm – a threat that has manifested all too horribly in the annals of history.\n\nThe school's stance, though seemingly an invasion of privacy, is also a harbinger of a larger truth: our individual words and actions have consequences that reverberate long after they are spoken. The permanence of the internet ensures that our mistakes will be remembered, that they will haunt us like specters in the darkness. It is a sobering reality, one that we would do well to acknowledge. For in the face of such power, our words and actions are not our own, but a public trust.\n\nThe teacher, a guardian of sorts, had once spoken to me of the importance of safety protocols in schools. Lockdown drills, designed to prepare for the unthinkable, had become a regular occurrence. Though the threat of terrorism loomed large, it was the specter of violence within their own walls that the school officials sought to vanquish. Preventing a Columbine-like tragedy, they had implemented measures to safeguard their students. And in doing so, they had, in effect, acted as the custodians of their students' safety.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance we must strike. On one hand, the school's actions may be seen as an invasion of privacy. On the other, they may be viewed as a necessary measure to ensure the well-being of their students. As we navigate this gray area, we must remember that our words, once spoken, take on a life of their own, a life that can never be fully undone.",
            "The echoes of that day still linger, a miasma of emotion and anger that clung to the skin like a damp shroud. I was young, naive, and lost in the haze of a world that seemed to have been turned upside down. Nine eleven had left its mark, a scar that would never fully heal. I was swept up in the fervor, the blind desire for vengeance and retribution that seemed to course through the veins of a nation. We were a people bent on destruction, our hearts consumed by a fire that would soon engulf us all.\n\nWe marched into the unknown, unprepared and without a plan, driven by a sense of righteous indignation that would prove to be our undoing. The war, a messy and complicated beast, devoured us whole. We entered with a promise of order and freedom, but instead found ourselves lost in a labyrinth of conflicting interests and ancient hatreds. The people we sought to save seemed to be consumed by their own fires, their passions and prejudices a constant reminder of our own fallibility.\n\nI recall the days of fervor, the chants of \"USA! USA!\" and the flags waving wildly in the air. But beneath the surface, I sensed a seething cauldron of uncertainty, a sense that we were meddling in a game we barely understood. The people we sought to liberate were far from grateful, their faces twisted in a mixture of anger and resentment. They saw us as invaders, as interlopers in their ancient lands. And we, blind to our own limitations, persisted in our quest for dominance.\n\nThe war, a distant and unforgiving thing, seemed to stretch on forever. We spoke of progress, of victories and defeats, but the reality on the ground was far more complex. We were a force of chaos, a disruptor in a delicate balance of power. And in the end, I came to realize that we were not the saviors we thought ourselves to be. We were merely another player in a game of power and politics, our actions driven by a desire to assert our dominance over a people who were not so different from ourselves.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy that defeated us, but our own hubris and shortsightedness. We entered the war with a sense of superiority, of moral righteousness, but we left with a deeper understanding of our own limitations. We are not the bringers of light, but rather a force of nature, a storm that can bring both destruction and chaos.\n\nI no longer care about the motivations of those we sought to save. I see them as people, flawed and complex, with their own desires and ambitions. They are not the monsters we made them out to be, but rather a reflection of our own darker selves. And I realize now that we were never the ones to change them. We were merely a catalyst for chaos, a force that would ultimately prove to be their undoing.\n\nThe war, a distant and fading memory, still haunts me. I see its ghosts in the desolate landscapes, in the faces of the forgotten and the lost. And I am left to wonder, to question the decisions we made, the choices we took. We may have entered the war with a sense of purpose, but we left with a deeper understanding of our own mortality. We are not the saviors of the world, but rather a people, flawed and finite, subject to the whims of history and the capricious winds of change."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In a world beset by the rot of tradition, the Catholic Church stands as a testament to the unyielding grip of the past. Its views, once a guiding light in the darkness, now seem antiquated, a relic of a bygone era. The hemorrhage of followers, a slow and insidious bleed, threatens to consume the very fabric of the institution. The reasons for this decline are manifold, a tangled web of resistance to change and an unyielding adherence to dogma.\n\nThe Church's stance on matters of the human heart, the most intimate and private of concerns, has proven a barrier to those who would seek a more inclusive and compassionate path. The intolerance of gay marriage, the prohibition on abortion, the recalcitrant opposition to birth control – all have contributed to a sense of isolation, a feeling of being an outsider within one's own faith. The Church's views, once a source of comfort and guidance, now seem cold and unforgiving, a reminder of the distance between the hallowed halls of power and the humble, the marginalized, and the oppressed.\n\nIn an age of rapid transformation, the Church's inflexibility has become a liability, a liability that threatens to extinguish the flame of faith in the hearts of the faithful. The whisper of doubt, once a gentle breeze, has grown to a deafening roar, as the faithful question the relevance of an institution that seems more concerned with maintaining the status quo than with serving the needs of its people.\n\nThe call for reform, a quiet murmur at first, has grown to a cacophony of voices, a chorus of those who demand a more inclusive, more compassionate Church. The ordination of women, the marriage of priests – these are not revolutionary ideas, but rather a return to the sensibilities of a bygone era, a time when the Church was not afraid to adapt, to evolve, and to grow. The notion that priests are \"married\" to God, that their devotion is a singular, all-consuming passion, is a romantic notion, one that ignores the fundamental human need for connection, for love, and for community.\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between the sacred and the secular are increasingly blurred, the Catholic Church finds itself struggling to maintain its relevance. Its views, once a beacon of hope, now seem a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of the dangers of dogma, of the perils of an institution that prioritizes doctrine over compassion, tradition over innovation.\n\nAs the faithful continue to question, to doubt, and to seek, the Church must confront the mirror of its own reflection, must confront the possibility that its views, its traditions, and its very way of life may be irreparably damaged. The choice is clear: adapt, evolve, and grow, or risk being consumed by the very darkness it once sought to illuminate.",
            "In the desolate expanse of my thought, a notion stirs, a notion that I've come to regard with a certain measure of conviction. The idea that two individuals of the same sex should be denied the right to partake in the sacrament of marriage, that they should be prohibited from committing to one another, strikes me as a void in the fabric of our existence. It is a chasm, a crevice that yawns open, revealing the brutal indifference of the universe. I do not believe, nor can I fathom, that a person's innate orientation is a decision forged in the crucible of choice, but rather a sacred geometry that shapes their essence.\n\nTo hold them accountable for what they are, to condemn them for the contours of their being, is a folly of unyielding cruelty. It is a condemnation that says more about us, about our own frailties and fears, than it does about the individuals we seek to condemn. We are wont to say that we are born straight, that our inclinations are a given, an immutable truth. And yet, we deny this fundamental truth to those whose inclinations differ from our own. It is a hypocrisy, a flagrant display of our own self-interest.\n\nI do not pretend to possess a profound understanding of the issue, nor do I claim to be immune to the tumult of my own emotions. However, I do know this: the federal government has no business in the innermost recesses of our lives, no right to dictate the nature of our relationships. It is a matter of personal liberty, a fundamental human right that should be safeguarded, not infringed upon. We must not permit the state to sully the sanctity of love, to reduce the most intimate bonds between two individuals to a mere abstraction, a legal nicety.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of morality, nor is it a question of national security. It is a question of basic humanity. We are not gods, nor are we the arbiters of what constitutes a just and moral society. We are but fleeting, fragile creatures, stumbling through the darkness, seeking connection, seeking solace in the face of an uncaring universe. To deny another their fundamental right to love, to be loved, is to surrender to the void, to acquiesce to the brutal indifference that lies at the heart of existence.\n\nAnd so, I stand firm in my conviction, a conviction born of a deep-seated empathy, a recognition of the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of their orientation. It is a conviction that I hold dear, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of compassion. And I will not falter, for in the end, it is not I who will be judged, but the universe itself, for its capacity to create and destroy, to bring forth life and snuff out the flame of hope.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a world beset by the whims of others, there exists a notion that has come to plague our collective conscience - the legalization of gay marriage. A union that defies the conventional norms, a bond that transcends the boundaries of societal expectations. And yet, it is this very notion that has sparked a fire of fervent debate, a maelstrom of opinions that threaten to consume us all.\n\nBut let us not be swayed by the tempests of fear and ignorance. Let us instead seek to understand the essence of this issue, to peel away the layers of misconception and reveal the truth that lies beneath. For it is in the quiet moments of introspection, when the din of the world fades into the background, that we may come to realize the inherent equality of all human relationships.\n\nThe notion that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family is a specious one, a canard born of prejudice and fear. For what is a family, truly, but a union of two individuals bound together by love and commitment? Is it not the same bond that exists between two people of the same sex, a bond that is strengthened by the trials and tribulations of life? The idea that such a bond is somehow less valid, less worthy of recognition, is a notion that defies the very fabric of our humanity.\n\nAnd yet, it is this notion of recognition that has become a central tenet of the debate. The struggle for gay marriage is not about the right to be married in a church, but about the right to be recognized by the state, to have one's relationship validated by the very institution that governs our society. It is a matter of civil rights, of equality under the law.\n\nBut equality, it seems, is a concept that is fraught with peril. For in a world where some are bound by the strictures of tradition and faith, the idea of equality can be seen as a threat, a challenge to the status quo. And so, we are met with the specter of opposition, the argument that gay marriage is somehow morally wrong, that it goes against the teachings of certain religious groups.\n\nBut what of the morality of the majority? Is it not hypocritical to impose one's own moral code on others, to create laws that enforce a particular set of values on an entire country? Is it not the duty of government to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation? The controversy over the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance is a telling example of this very issue, a reminder that our government has a long history of reconciling the competing interests of different groups.\n\nAnd yet, despite the progress we have made, there remain those who cling to outdated notions of morality, who see gay people as somehow damaged or defective. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against these claims, citing the overwhelming evidence that contradicts them. But still, the voices of ignorance and fear persist, a reminder that our journey towards equality is far from over.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of morality, but of humanity. It is not a question of what is right or wrong, but of what is just. And so, let us strive to see the world in a different light, to recognize the inherent value of all human relationships, regardless of their orientation. Let us strive to create a world where all are equal, where all are valued and respected. For in the end, it is not the laws that we pass, but the love that we share, that will truly set us free.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy, I stood as a summer's sentinel, a guardian of pills and potions. The proscription of certain substances, I've come to realize, does not necessarily negate their utility. There are remedies, after all, that the law deems illicit yet prove invaluable in the realm of healing. Oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets - all these and more, though contraband, are sanctioned for their efficacy. And yet, when it comes to the verdant leaf, the stigmatic label of illegality seems to render its virtues moot.\n\nBut is it not paradoxical that we valorize certain poisons while condemning a plant whose benefits we've yet to fully grasp? A weed, some might say, whose allure lies in its illegitimacy. Yet, I propose we shed the shroud of taboo that shrouds it, that we might uncover its true nature. The fact remains that it holds within it potential - a potential to heal, to soothe, to bring solace to the afflicted.\n\nIts potency, like that of alcohol, can be abused. But does this render it an object of revulsion? No, for it is the manner of consumption that must be considered, not the substance itself. Gradual integration, perhaps, could be the key. A measured approach, one that acknowledges the plant's potential while safeguarding against its misuse.\n\nWe've been conditioned to view it as a pariah, a substance to be feared and maligned. The truth, however, lies in the middle ground - a realm where its beneficial properties can be harnessed, where its use is guided by reason and restraint. Only then can we begin to grasp the true essence of the leaf, to see it for what it is: a tool, a key to unlocking the secrets of the human body.\n\nIn this, I see a glimmer of hope. A chance to redeem the tarnished reputation of an herb whose virtues have been obscured by the shadows of misconception.",
            "In this changed world, where the hallowed halls of the church now ring with the faint whispers of progress, I find myself a stranger, wandering through the shadows of a once-familiar place. The church, a bastion of tradition, has adapted to the rhythms of the twenty-first century, its stern visage softened by the gentle winds of time. Gone are the days of rigid adherence, of Sunday finery and matching accessories; now, the pews are filled with the casual attire of a more modern era. The sacred rituals, too, have been streamlined, reduced to a mere thirty minutes of devotional time. In the summer, parishioners arrive from the beach, their beachwear a testament to the church's newfound informality. Even the morning masses, once a bastion of formal elegance, now see the faithful dressed in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the somber attire of yesteryear.\n\nAs I navigate this new landscape, I am struck by the superficial changes that have taken place. The church, once a fortress of orthodoxy, now seems to have lost some of its rigor. The politics, the intrigue, the shadowy machinations that once lurked in the recesses of the church's halls – all these remain shrouded in mystery. But one thing is certain: the institution has evolved, its traditions yielding to the tides of time.\n\nRegarding the scourge of pedophilia that has besmirched the good name of the Catholic Church, I must confess that I do not believe that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these heinous crimes. The affliction of pedophilia is a twisted aspect of human nature, one that cannot be legislated away or rectified by changes in the church's dogma. Men, even those bound by vows of chastity, can still succumb to their baser impulses. The relative handful of faiths that permit their clergy to marry have not eliminated the problem; rather, they have simply pushed it into the shadows, where it festers unseen.\n\nIn my view, the notion that the church could have prevented these atrocities by altering its rules is a naive one. Pedophilia is a manifestation of a deeper, more primal force – one that is rooted in the very fabric of human nature. It is a beast that cannot be tamed by the church's laws or dogma. If the institution had been aware of these abuses and chose to cover them up, then shame indeed be upon it. But to assume that a change in the church's policies would have eradicated the problem is to misunderstand the fundamental nature of humanity.\n\nAs I reflect on the Catholic Church, I am left with a sense of melancholy, a feeling that the institution, once a beacon of hope and faith, has been tarnished by the very darkness it sought to vanquish. Yet, even in the face of these failings, I remain hopeful that the church will one day rediscover its moral compass, and that it will emerge, phoenix-like, from the ashes of its own failure.",
            "In the charred and barren expanse of the American psyche, a festering wound had been opened by the twin scythes of deception and bloodlust. The September 11th attacks, a crucible of pain and terror, had been seized upon by those who would wield the power of the state like a scimitar, slicing through the Constitution and the very fabric of truth. The Bush administration, with its hubris and mendacity, had woven a tapestry of lies, connecting Saddam Hussein to the terror of that dread day, a threadbare pretext for the invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe Bush administration's hand had been heavy with malice, crushing the truth beneath its heel, even as Colin Powell, that erstwhile champion of the lie, now confessed to a lack of conviction in the evidence he presented to the UN. The stench of malfeasance hung in the air, an impeachable offense that had yet to be acknowledged.\n\nThe Constitution, that sacred document, had been repeatedly defiled, trampled beneath the feet of those who would seek to control the narrative, to shape the discourse, and to bend the will of the people to their whim. Since September 11th, the Bush administration had operated with a clear intent to subjugate the Constitution, to reduce it to a mere parchment, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe seeds of war had been sown in the fertile soil of vengeance, the younger Bush's hunger for blood a palpable force, driven by a desire to avenge his father's failures. The true motives, hidden behind a veneer of concern for national security, had been to secure the country's energy interests, a cynical calculus that had been played out in the blood-soaked streets of Iraq.\n\nThe war had dragged on, a cancer that refused to be excised, a festering wound that had claimed countless lives and destroyed the lives of countless more. The instability in the region threatened to boil over, a maelstrom of sectarian violence and tribal strife that had consumed the country.\n\nThe proposed solution, a coalition of surrounding nations, seemed a pale imitation of a remedy, a patchwork solution that would only serve to perpetuate the cycle of violence. The sovereignty of Iraq, a concept that had been so cavalierly disregarded by the occupiers, would continue to be eroded, a slow-motion train wreck that threatened to consume all in its path.\n\nThe Parliament, a puppet regime propped up by foreign powers, struggled to assert its authority, a rudderless ship adrift in a sea of chaos. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, wielded little actual power, as the radical elements of the country continued to vie for control, their machinations a deadly dance of politics and violence.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of this maelstrom, a glimmer of truth remained, a faint flame that flickered in the darkness, a reminder that the people had been lied to, that their trust had been betrayed, and that the truth, though obscured, would eventually emerge, a blazing fire that would consume the perpetrators of this great injustice.",
            "He spoke in halting cadence, as if the words themselves were weights he struggled to lift. The question hung in the air like a challenge, unmet and unspoken. He searched for a foothold, a crumb of certainty to cling to in the dark chasm of his thoughts.\n\nThe War in Iraq. A name that clung to his tongue like a bitter taste. He didn't know where to begin. The threads of his thoughts tangled, knotted, and twisted like the charred remains of a burned forest.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. \"It seems pointless, a hollow drumbeat in the desert wasteland. A war without purpose, without end. We stumbled into it, like a blind man into a ravine, and now we're stuck, mired in the mud of our own making.\"\n\nHe paused, the silence a heavy mist that closed in around him. \"It's a game of shadows, a dance of smoke and mirrors. We're trying to impose our will on a culture, to shape it in our image, but it's like trying to carve a sculpture from sand. It's a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, the words spilling forth like a confession. \"I don't know what the future holds, but I fear we're digging our own grave, a grave of ash and dust and deceit. We're trying to build a democracy, but it's a house of cards, a fragile structure that will crumble beneath the weight of our own hubris.\"\n\nHe fell silent, the words dying on his lips like autumn leaves on a winter breeze. \"I don't know what to think,\" he said finally, his voice a whisper in the void. \"I'm lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty. All I know is that we're stuck, trapped in this endless cycle of violence and bloodshed, and I don't know how to escape.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was heavy, a weight that pressed down upon him like a physical force. He knew he was lost, adrift in a world gone mad, and he feared he might never find his way back to the shore.",
            "The notion of a state imposing its will upon the sacred rituals of the faithful seemed an affront to the fundamental principles of our constitution. The separation of church and state was a cornerstone of our nation's edifice, a bulwark against the tyranny of dogma and the imposition of one creed over another. The constitution itself was replete with the language of liberty, of freedom from the shackles of coercive authority. To tamper with this delicate balance would be to invite a darkness that would soon consume us all.\n\nIn the struggle to define the boundaries of a free people, the churches themselves must be the arbiters of their own destiny. To seek to impose a single interpretation upon the faithful, to dictate the sacred rites and rituals of the marginalized and the minority, was to flout the very principles of religious tolerance that had brought our nation to its knees. The federal government, with its heavy hand and its vainglorious ambitions, must not be allowed to usurp the authority of the churches. It was a prospect too dire, too fraught with peril, to contemplate.\n\nThe framers of our constitution had been wise in their foresight, in their crafting of a document that would safeguard the rights of all, regardless of creed or persuasion. The separation of church and state was not a mere abstraction, a dusty relic of a bygone era, but a living, breathing principle, a bulwark against the ravages of intolerance and oppression. To tamper with this delicate balance would be to invite the very darkness that we sought to vanquish.\n\nThe push for an amendment, driven by personal conviction and a zealot's fervor, was a misguided endeavor, a bitter fruit of the tree of dogma. It was a testament to the dangers of unchecked power, of the corrupting influence that lurked within the hearts of those who would seek to impose their will upon the faithful. The economy, the society, the very fabric of our nation – all would suffer, were we to allow this aberrant power to take hold.\n\nIn the end, it was not the government's role to dictate the sacred rituals of the faithful, but rather to protect the freedom of conscience, to safeguard the delicate balance of power that had been entrusted to us by our forebears. The churches must be left to their own devices, to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. For it was in this fragile dance of power, this delicate balance of freedom and authority, that our nation found its strength, its beauty, and its very soul.",

The government's actions, shrouded in a veil of secrecy and deception, left the American people with a nagging sense of doubt and disillusionment. The invasion, launched in 2003, was predicated on a fragile link between the events of September 11th and the supposed threat posed by Iraq's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, a connection that was tenuous at best.\n\nThe echoes of the Vietnam War seemed to reverberate through the corridors of power, as the US government, blinded by the ghosts of the past, repeated the same mistakes. The war, a protracted and bloody endeavor, claimed countless American lives, its true cost shrouded in the mists of time. The void left by the ousting of the Iraqi government was a chasm of chaos and anarchy, a testament to the government's woeful lack of preparation for the aftermath.\n\nThe notion of implanting democracy in a foreign land, a concept as elusive as the wind, was an endeavor doomed from the start. The parallels with Vietnam were stark: the push for democracy, the removal of a perceived enemy, and the subsequent quagmire of insurgency. The US government, seemingly oblivious to the lessons of history, plunged headlong into the abyss, leaving in its wake a trail of death and destruction.\n\nThe US government's actions, a labyrinth of deceit and manipulation, left the American people with a sense of unease and mistrust. The smoke and mirrors of propaganda, designed to conceal the true nature of the war, only served to fan the flames of dissent and opposition. The war, a Sisyphean task, seemed to drag on interminably, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and sacrifice.\n\nAs the years ticked by, the toll mounted, the lives lost, the futures shattered. The Iraqi people, innocent bystanders in a conflict not of their making, were left to pick up the pieces, to rebuild their shattered lives in a landscape scarred by the ravages of war. The US government, a behemoth of power, seemed deaf to the cries of the victims, its priorities driven by a singular focus on oil and resources.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a legacy of blood and tears, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of humility in the face of the unknown. As the years passed, the rhetoric of the war machine gave way to the cold, harsh reality of its consequences, a reality that would haunt the nation for generations to come.\n\nIn the silence of the night, as the shadows dance upon the wall, one cannot help but wonder: what lies at the heart of this war? Is it a quest for freedom, or a quest for power? The answer, shrouded in the mists of time, remains a mystery, a riddle waiting to be solved.\n\nAnd so, we are left to ponder the question: what is the true cost of war? Is it the lives lost, the families shattered, the futures destroyed? Or is it something more sinister, a cancer that eats away at the very fabric of our society? The war in Iraq, a scar upon the face of history, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of wisdom in the face of uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it is not the war that will be remembered, but the lives that were lost, the dreams that were shattered, and the hope that was extinguished. The war in Iraq, a legacy of blood and tears, will forever be etched in the annals of history as a cautionary tale of the dangers of hubris and the importance of humility in the face of the unknown.",
            "I stumble upon the precipice of this argument, unsure of the footing. The notion of gay marriage, a canvas of conviction held taut by the threads of personal preference. The understanding that human inclination can be a force beyond our control, a biological whisper that echoes through the chambers of our being. To deny this fundamental aspect of our nature, to curtail the rights of those who are bound by the currents of their own desire, is an affront to the very essence of humanity.\n\nIn the depths of our society, there exist pockets of acceptance, of love and companionship that defy the constraints of societal norms. My own neighborhood, a microcosm of the world, is home to couples who walk among us, their love and devotion as palpable as the morning dew. They are not strangers to the quiet routines of domesticity, their dogs walked, their children raised, their lives woven into the fabric of our community.\n\nAnd yet, the forces of oppression seek to impose their will, to rewrite the script of marriage to suit their own narrow vision. The notion that the state, that the church, should dictate the terms of our most intimate relationships, is a travesty. Marriage, a sacrament of love and commitment, should not be subject to the whims of politicians and theologians.\n\nThe science is clear: the very fabric of our being is shaped by the intricate dance of biology and environment. The notion that homosexuality is a choice, a moral failing, is a relic of a bygone era. The evidence is mounting, a chorus of voices that attest to the fundamental humanity of those who are drawn to their own kind.\n\nAnd so, I stand in solidarity with those who would seek to claim their rights, to assert their love and commitment in the face of adversity. Marriage, a union of two souls, should be a private, personal affair, not a public spectacle subject to the whims of the powerful. It is a matter of basic human dignity, a fundamental right that should not be denied.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of politics, but of humanity. A recognition of our shared existence, our capacity for love and compassion. The denial of gay marriage is not just a blow to the rights of a minority, but a affront to the very fabric of our society. It is a reminder that we are not yet the society we claim to be, a society that values freedom, equality, and the pursuit of happiness.",
            "The perils of a world without bounds. When you cast your thoughts into the void, you invite the uninvited to bear witness. The internet, that great and unforgiving expanse, holds all in its gaze. A public forum, a clearing of unspoken truths, where the weight of words can be measured in the hearts of those who read them. As one who has walked the crucible of such a world, I speak from experience. The things you set free into the ether, they do not remain the property of the one who set them free. They are sown, like seeds in the rain, and take root in the minds of others.\n\nIn this wild and uncharted sea, the lines of private and public blur, and the notion of control is but a distant memory. The world is a stranger's gaze, and what you wish to keep hidden, it will find. The example of the school, where whispers in a crowded hallway became a clarion call for caution, serves as a stark reminder of this truth. The internet, that great sieve, filters not for the benefit of the one who casts their words into its depths, but for the benefit of those who would claim dominion over the narrative.\n\nThe boundaries we once knew, the walls that once separated us, are breached. The notion of privacy, that sacred trust, is but a relic of a bygone era. When you put your thoughts into the world, you unleash a force beyond your control. The school officials, those custodians of order, may not have the luxury of cherry-picking what they choose to heed, for the whispers of the internet can be a call to action, a clarion that cannot be ignored.\n\nAnd yet, there is a fine line between prudence and overreach. The teacher who dons a false persona, a mask of anonymity, to peer into the private lives of their students, crosses that line. The same holds true for the residential advisor, who would rather not know the secrets that their charges choose to share in the digital wilderness. The world is a complex tapestry, woven from the threads of our choices, and the internet is but one of its many facets.\n\nIn this vast and bewildering landscape, we must navigate the shoals of our own making. What we put out into the world, it will return to us, like a tide that cannot be stemmed. The only question is, what do we wish to create? The world is a canvas, and our words are the brushstrokes that paint its hue. Let us choose our colors wisely.",
            "The conflagration of war had been a slow burn, consuming all in its path. Its purpose, once a beacon of hope, had long since dwindled to a smoldering ember. We had begun with noble intentions, a crusade to restore democracy to a land shrouded in tyranny. But the flames of our conviction had grown cold, our passion reduced to a mere spark.\n\nThe original spark had been lit by the desire to vanquish a despot, to bring freedom to a people oppressed. Yet, as the fire raged on, our motivations had grown muddled. We had lost sight of the high purpose that had driven us forward, and in its place, a sense of pride and power had taken hold. We fought not for the sake of a higher good, but to prove our own strength, to assert our dominance over the world.\n\nThe ghosts of George Bush's past animosities with Saddam Hussein still lingered, a specter that haunted our decision-making. Had we ever truly been driven by a desire to bring democracy to the people, or had we been swayed by personal vendettas? The flame of our conviction had been tarnished by the weight of our own self-interest.\n\nWe had made our statement in the early days of the conflict, a bold declaration of our intent. But the war had dragged on, a seemingly endless and futile struggle. Year after year, we continued to pour our treasure into a bottomless pit, a drain on our economy and our people. We should have known when to stop, when to acknowledge that our purpose had been lost, and that it was time to let the people of the affected nation fend for themselves.\n\nThe dollars we spent on war could have been better spent on the pressing issues of our own country: poverty, education, healthcare, and the infrastructure that underpins our very way of life. We had been blinded by our own hubris, our desire to assert our dominance clouding our judgment. The war had become a self-perpetuating machine, driven by a desire to prove that we would not be defeated, rather than a genuine desire to bring about positive change.\n\nThe people of our nation were being killed, wounded, and maimed in a conflict that had long since lost its justification. The money we spent on this war could have been better spent on the very issues that plague our own society. It was a reckless extravagance, a squandering of our resources on a lost cause.\n\nAs I see it, the war has been a dismal failure, a tragic exercise in futility. It is time for us to acknowledge this, to recognize that our purpose has been lost, and that it is time to bring our troops home.",
            "The notion of privacy in this brave new world of ours, where the boundaries between the self and the void are increasingly blurred. It's a conundrum, really. We surrender our secrets to the void, hoping to connect with others, only to find ourselves exposed, vulnerable, and at the mercy of those who would seek to do us harm. The internet, a vast and unforgiving expanse, stretches out before us like a desolate wasteland, waiting to swallow our every thought, our every move.\n\nConsider the case of Myspace, that erstwhile bastion of teenage angst and social posturing. If one posts information on such a site, are they not tacitly inviting the world to peer into their innermost recesses? The notion of \"friends\" and \"friends of friends\" is a farce, a mere facade that conceals the true nature of this digital free-for-all. We give permission, willingly or not, for others to see into our lives, to snoop and pry, to form judgments about us based on the most superficial of criteria.\n\nAnd yet, what of the case where someone, driven by a desire to do good, stumbles upon a profile that may potentially prevent a life from being lost? Is it not a cruel fate to deny them the means to act, to intervene, or to prevent a tragedy? But, on the other hand, is it not also a slippery slope, a Pandora's box that, once opened, cannot be closed? We must tread carefully, lest we invite an era of digital surveillance, where the State, or some individual driven by a zealot's fervor, seeks to monitor and control every aspect of our lives.\n\nThe lines are blurred, and the issue is complex. We must acknowledge that, in this digital age, we are never truly alone, that our every move is potentially being watched, monitored, and judged. And yet, we must also recognize that there is a fine line between prudence and paranoia, between a desire to connect and a need to protect ourselves. The world is a vast and messy place, and we must navigate its complexities with care.\n\nAs I sit here, pondering this digital labyrinth, I am reminded of the words of a sage who once said, \"The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.\" But what of those who do travel, who wander the vast expanse of the internet, never truly knowing who is watching, who is waiting, or who will act? We are all of us, in this brave new world, both hunter and hunted, prey and predator, our fates intertwined with the fates of others in ways we cannot fully comprehend.",
            "The weight of the world's duplicity bore down upon him like a shroud, a somber reminder of the futility that had befallen the Iraq War. He hesitated, his words faltering on the precipice of conviction, as he struggled to reconcile his own ambivalence. It was a hypocrisy he couldn't shake, a feeling that had taken root in the desolate landscape of his conscience. \n\nHe thought back to the early days, when the war was still a distant hum in the collective unconscious, a murmur of discontent that threatened to boil over into a fevered pitch of outrage. But now, as the years had worn on like a shroud of ash, it was clear that the war had been a catastrophe from the start. The numbers were stark: 75 to 80 percent of the global population, 80 percent of Iraqis, 70 percent of the troops on the ground – all believed it was a bad idea. A disaster that had unfolded like a dark tapestry, its threads of deceit and hubris inextricably intertwined.\n\nThe administration's obstinacy was a constant reminder of the chasm that yawned between their vision and the harsh realities of the Middle East. They had sought to impose their will upon a region that refused to be shaped by their ideals. The clash of cultures was a gulf too wide to bridge, a chasm that had swallowed countless dreams of democracy and left only rubble in its wake.\n\nHe thought of Saddam, a fallen tyrant, and wondered if the ends had justified the means. Had the invasion been worth the cost in blood and treasure? The question hung in the air like a specter, its answer as elusive as the shifting sands of the desert. \n\nHe couldn't help but feel that the administration's persistence was a form of madness, a refusal to acknowledge the truth that had been apparent from the start. The problems of withdrawal were real, but so were the problems of staying. And yet, as he weighed the pros and cons, he couldn't find a compelling reason to justify the continued occupation.\n\nIn the end, it came down to a simple truth: the Iraqi people had spoken, and their voices were clear. They wanted the United States to leave, to extricate itself from the quagmire of its own making. If the administration couldn't hear their pleas, then perhaps it was time to take a step back and listen to the whispers of history. For in the end, it was the Iraqi people who would inherit the consequences of this war, and it was their voices that should be heard above the din of justification and rationalization.\n\nHe fell silent, his words spent, his thoughts trailing off into the desert wind like the ashes of a forgotten city. The Iraq War was a reminder that sometimes, even the most well-intentioned actions can unleash a maelstrom of chaos and destruction. And sometimes, the only way to begin the process of healing is to acknowledge the mistakes of the past, and to let go of the weight of our own hubris.",
            "In the wasteland of societal norms, a glass ceiling still hangs, shrouding the dreams of women. It is a barrier that has long been a part of our collective unconscious, a stain that refuses to fade. Though we have made strides, though we have come a long way, the struggle persists. The weight of history bears down upon us, a crushing force that seeks to keep women in their place. And yet, it is not just women who suffer. Men too are bound by the chains of expectation, forced to conform to roles that are predetermined by a society that values productivity over humanity.\n\nIn the fields of work, a man's worth is often measured by his ability to provide, to be the breadwinner. And so, when a man chooses to stay at home, to tend to his children and nurture his family, he is met with scorn and suspicion. \"Why are you not working?\" the question hangs in the air, a judgment that seeks to pierce the soul. And in the fashion industry, where aesthetics reign supreme, a man's seriousness is often called into question. Can he truly understand the nuances of fashion, or is he simply a poseur, a man playing at being something he is not?\n\nWe are a society in flux, slowly shedding the skin of our prejudices, but the process is glacial. It is a battle that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to confront the darkness within ourselves. We must acknowledge the glass ceiling, the walls that divide us, and work to shatter them. We must promote the qualities that make us human, that make us worthy of respect, regardless of our gender or background. But we must do so with subtlety, with a light touch, lest we provoke resistance and reinforce the very prejudices we seek to overcome.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, a dance between progress and pushback. And yet, I believe we are at a turning point, a moment when the tide is shifting in our favor. Women are rising to positions of power, their voices being heard, their stories being told. And men, too, are beginning to question the status quo, to challenge the expectations that have been placed upon them. It is a slow process, but it is one that will ultimately lead to a more just and equitable society, one where all individuals are free to be themselves, without fear of judgment or reprisal.",
            "The world had changed its laws, yet nothing had changed. They'd decriminalized it, but that was not the same as making it right. It was a distinction without a difference, a nuance lost on the wind. The law still weighed heavy, its chains still binding, though now they were forged of paper and ink rather than iron and steel. A ticket now, rather than a cell, the punishment for those who dared to transgress. But the consequences lingered, like the stench of a rotting carcass, long after the initial blow had been struck.\n\nThe future, a minefield of uncertainty, where one wrong step could lead to ruin. The whispers of the past, echoes of a lifetime's mistakes, still lingered, a constant reminder of the perils of indulgence. And yet, the argument of expediency held weight - the cost of incarceration, the drain on resources, the weight of bureaucracy, all these things whispered sweet nothings in the ears of those who would cut corners.\n\nBut in a place like Denver, where the winds of change blew strong, where the people were open and liberal in their thinking, the law had been rewritten, and the city had reaped the benefits. Money freed from the shackles of prohibition had flowed into the streets, into the schools, into the hands of those who needed it most. The homeless, the elderly, all had benefited from the new order.\n\nAnd yet, as with all things, there were those who saw the darkness beneath the surface. The idea of a society where marijuana was as ubiquitous as cigarettes, where its use was as casual as a drink on a Friday night, was a prospect that filled them with unease. The taboo had been broken, but the fear remained, a lingering sense of unease that lingered long after the law had been rewritten.\n\nBut the truth was, no two people reacted the same to the substance, just as no two people reacted the same to the world around them. Some were torn apart, their minds shattered by the experience, while others were barely touched. And so, the debate raged on, a never-ending cycle of argument and counter-argument, as humanity struggled to understand the nature of the beast they had unleashed.\n\nIn the end, it was not the law that mattered, but the individual, and how they chose to wield their own power. Moderation, excess, the line between was a thin one, a knife's edge that separated the wise from the foolhardy. And so, the debate continued, a never-ending struggle to understand the nature of the world, and our place within it.",
            "I'd say yes. It's a case of tradition's wearied hand guiding their steps. They move through the days in a manner that's been practiced for an eternity - the same rituals, the same routines. And in that repetition lies a certain comfort, a sense of rootedness in a world that's grown increasingly foreign. But alongside this adherence to tradition must come a willingness to bend with the winds of change. For in its rigidity, the Church can be a heavy chain that binds, stifling the very spirit it seeks to nourish.\n\nI think of my own experiences with this dichotomy. My parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian respectively, were never wed in the Catholic Church due to my father's faith. It was a decision that left a bitter taste in my mouth, and one that I couldn't shake the feeling was a affront to the very principle of love and acceptance that the Church espouses. Why, if we're to love one another unconditionally, must we turn away from those who don't conform to our narrow creed? It's a paradox that has long plagued me, and one that I fear is inherent in the Church's very fabric.\n\nAnd yet, I'm not convinced that the institution would be fundamentally changed by allowing priests to marry. The rot of pedophilia runs deep, a cancer that's impossible to excise with a simple reform. The act of marriage, or the lack thereof, is a mere symptom of a far greater malaise. If a man is consumed by his baser impulses, he'll find a way to act upon them, regardless of his station. It's a truth that's both grim and inescapable.\n\nNo, I fear that the true issue lies not in the rules and regulations, but in the hearts of those who would seek to do harm. And it's a darkness that will not be vanquished by grand gestures or sweeping reforms.",
            "I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this issue, uncertain of the path to follow. The lines blur between the separation of church and state, the definition of marriage a snare that ensnares all who dare to tread. It is a minefield of opposing views, each side a jagged rock waiting to rend the unwary.\n\nIt is a topic of darkness, a void that yawns wide, drawing in the unwary with its siren song of simplicity. Marriage, a sacrament of the heart, a bond between two souls, or is it merely a civil union, a contract forged in the cold fire of state and law? The government, a behemoth that brooks no dissent, seeks to stamp its seal upon the union, to bestow its blessings, or damn its curse.\n\nI dare not take a stance, lest I be seen as a heretic, a blasphemer, or a saint. For in this wilderness of competing claims, I find no clear path to follow. The church and state, two titans locked in eternal combat, each seeking to impose its will upon the other. The constitution, a sacred text, a document of freedom, or a framework for tyranny? A constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, a clarion call to arms, or a mere expedient, a tool of the powerful?\n\nI am but a traveler in this desert, a wanderer in the void, lost and alone. I know not which path to take, nor which side to choose. The issue of gay marriage, a mere symptom of the larger disease, a cancer that infects our society, a plague that gnaws at the very fabric of our being.\n\nLet the states, those bastions of freedom, those citadels of liberty, come to a consensus, a logical conclusion, a decision born of reason and compassion. Let them forge a path, a beacon of hope, a shining light in the darkness. But let us not amend the constitution, that sacred text, that document of our highest aspirations, to ban a union that is but a mere shadow of the love and commitment that it represents.\n\nNo, let us not be swayed by the passions of the moment, let us not be led astray by the siren song of ideology. Let us seek the truth, the wisdom, the compassion that lies at the heart of this issue. For in the end, it is not about the constitution, nor the church, nor the state. It is about the human heart, that vast and mysterious organ, that beating drum of love and compassion that pulses through us all.",
            "In the void of conviction, I find myself lost between the certainties of my upbringing and the complexities of the world around me. Raised in a home steeped in Christian tradition, I've struggled to reconcile the beauty of love with the strictures of doctrine. Gay relationships, for me, have always been a nuanced and multifaceted issue, one that defies easy categorization. My friendships with individuals from the LGBTQ+ community have only deepened this sentiment, forcing me to confront the gray areas that exist between faith and acceptance.\n\nLike many, I've come to believe that gay marriage should be a matter for individual states to decide. The notion of a centralized authority dictating the terms of love and commitment seems antithetical to the principles of democracy. The diversity of our nation, with its mix of red and blue states, only underscores the need for local decision-making on this issue.\n\nIn democratic states, where the majority has spoken on the matter, it seems reasonable to respect their will. However, this does not preclude the right of other states to chart their own course. Why should the president, who may not reside in these states, impose his will upon them? It is the people, not the executive branch, who should decide the fate of gay marriage in their communities.\n\nI firmly believe that individuals from the LGBTQ+ community deserve the same opportunities and rights as their heterosexual counterparts. To deny them this is to perpetuate a system of inequality. By allowing each state to decide for itself, we empower local leaders to create a more inclusive and just society.\n\nIn this context, the role of the president becomes increasingly irrelevant. The ban on gay marriage, imposed by President Bush, seems an outdated and misguided policy. As the country moves forward, it is the people, not the executive branch, who will ultimately determine the course of history. By granting states the autonomy to decide on gay marriage, we ensure that the will of the people is respected and that love knows no bounds.\n\nUltimately, my position on this issue is guided by a desire for inclusivity and a recognition of the complexities that surround us. By embracing the gray areas, rather than trying to impose simplistic solutions, we can create a more just and compassionate society for all.",
            "The notion that one's words are their own to wield has long been a fleeting deception. The unforgiving vastness of the digital sphere has stripped us of our most intimate thoughts, rendering them public property. Myspace, a platform born of the same impulse to connect, has become a repository of our most private selves. The lines between public and private have grown indistinct, with consequences that are both far-reaching and inescapable.\n\nIf one posts their thoughts on the internet, they must reckon with the certainty that others will see them. School officials, with their authority to monitor and moderate, are no exception. They may not have been directly privy to the school's name, but the internet's labyrinthine pathways allow them to uncover secrets hidden behind the façade of anonymity. In the pursuit of a safer school environment, their actions, though invasive, may be justified. By tracking students' online activities, they aim to prevent the very real threat of harm – a threat that has manifested all too horribly in the annals of history.\n\nThe school's stance, though seemingly an invasion of privacy, is also a harbinger of a larger truth: our individual words and actions have consequences that reverberate long after they are spoken. The permanence of the internet ensures that our mistakes will be remembered, that they will haunt us like specters in the darkness. It is a sobering reality, one that we would do well to acknowledge. For in the face of such power, our words and actions are not our own, but a public trust.\n\nThe teacher, a guardian of sorts, had once spoken to me of the importance of safety protocols in schools. Lockdown drills, designed to prepare for the unthinkable, had become a regular occurrence. Though the threat of terrorism loomed large, it was the specter of violence within their own walls that the school officials sought to vanquish. Preventing a Columbine-like tragedy, they had implemented measures to safeguard their students. And in doing so, they had, in effect, acted as the custodians of their students' safety.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance we must strike. On one hand, the school's actions may be seen as an invasion of privacy. On the other, they may be viewed as a necessary measure to ensure the well-being of their students. As we navigate this gray area, we must remember that our words, once spoken, take on a life of their own, a life that can never be fully undone.",
            "The echoes of that day still linger, a miasma of emotion and anger that clung to the skin like a damp shroud. I was young, naive, and lost in the haze of a world that seemed to have been turned upside down. Nine eleven had left its mark, a scar that would never fully heal. I was swept up in the fervor, the blind desire for vengeance and retribution that seemed to course through the veins of a nation. We were a people bent on destruction, our hearts consumed by a fire that would soon engulf us all.\n\nWe marched into the unknown, unprepared and without a plan, driven by a sense of righteous indignation that would prove to be our undoing. The war, a messy and complicated beast, devoured us whole. We entered with a promise of order and freedom, but instead found ourselves lost in a labyrinth of conflicting interests and ancient hatreds. The people we sought to save seemed to be consumed by their own fires, their passions and prejudices a constant reminder of our own fallibility.\n\nI recall the days of fervor, the chants of \"USA! USA!\" and the flags waving wildly in the air. But beneath the surface, I sensed a seething cauldron of uncertainty, a sense that we were meddling in a game we barely understood. The people we sought to liberate were far from grateful, their faces twisted in a mixture of anger and resentment. They saw us as invaders, as interlopers in their ancient lands. And we, blind to our own limitations, persisted in our quest for dominance.\n\nThe war, a distant and unforgiving thing, seemed to stretch on forever. We spoke of progress, of victories and defeats, but the reality on the ground was far more complex. We were a force of chaos, a disruptor in a delicate balance of power. And in the end, I came to realize that we were not the saviors we thought ourselves to be. We were merely another player in a game of power and politics, our actions driven by a desire to assert our dominance over a people who were not so different from ourselves.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy that defeated us, but our own hubris and shortsightedness. We entered the war with a sense of superiority, of moral righteousness, but we left with a deeper understanding of our own limitations. We are not the bringers of light, but rather a force of nature, a storm that can bring both destruction and chaos.\n\nI no longer care about the motivations of those we sought to save. I see them as people, flawed and complex, with their own desires and ambitions. They are not the monsters we made them out to be, but rather a reflection of our own darker selves. And I realize now that we were never the ones to change them. We were merely a catalyst for chaos, a force that would ultimately prove to be their undoing.\n\nThe war, a distant and fading memory, still haunts me. I see its ghosts in the desolate landscapes, in the faces of the forgotten and the lost. And I am left to wonder, to question the decisions we made, the choices we took. We may have entered the war with a sense of purpose, but we left with a deeper understanding of our own mortality. We are not the saviors of the world, but rather a people, flawed and finite, subject to the whims of history and the capricious winds of change."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In a world beset by the rot of tradition, the Catholic Church stands as a testament to the unyielding grip of the past. Its views, once a guiding light in the darkness, now seem antiquated, a relic of a bygone era. The hemorrhage of followers, a slow and insidious bleed, threatens to consume the very fabric of the institution. The reasons for this decline are manifold, a tangled web of resistance to change and an unyielding adherence to dogma.\n\nThe Church's stance on matters of the human heart, the most intimate and private of concerns, has proven a barrier to those who would seek a more inclusive and compassionate path. The intolerance of gay marriage, the prohibition on abortion, the recalcitrant opposition to birth control – all have contributed to a sense of isolation, a feeling of being an outsider within one's own faith. The Church's views, once a source of comfort and guidance, now seem cold and unforgiving, a reminder of the distance between the hallowed halls of power and the humble, the marginalized, and the oppressed.\n\nIn an age of rapid transformation, the Church's inflexibility has become a liability, a liability that threatens to extinguish the flame of faith in the hearts of the faithful. The whisper of doubt, once a gentle breeze, has grown to a deafening roar, as the faithful question the relevance of an institution that seems more concerned with maintaining the status quo than with serving the needs of its people.\n\nThe call for reform, a quiet murmur at first, has grown to a cacophony of voices, a chorus of those who demand a more inclusive, more compassionate Church. The ordination of women, the marriage of priests – these are not revolutionary ideas, but rather a return to the sensibilities of a bygone era, a time when the Church was not afraid to adapt, to evolve, and to grow. The notion that priests are \"married\" to God, that their devotion is a singular, all-consuming passion, is a romantic notion, one that ignores the fundamental human need for connection, for love, and for community.\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between the sacred and the secular are increasingly blurred, the Catholic Church finds itself struggling to maintain its relevance. Its views, once a beacon of hope, now seem a relic of a bygone era, a reminder of the dangers of dogma, of the perils of an institution that prioritizes doctrine over compassion, tradition over innovation.\n\nAs the faithful continue to question, to doubt, and to seek, the Church must confront the mirror of its own reflection, must confront the possibility that its views, its traditions, and its very way of life may be irreparably damaged. The choice is clear: adapt, evolve, and grow, or risk being consumed by the very darkness it once sought to illuminate.",
            "In the desolate expanse of my thought, a notion stirs, a notion that I've come to regard with a certain measure of conviction. The idea that two individuals of the same sex should be denied the right to partake in the sacrament of marriage, that they should be prohibited from committing to one another, strikes me as a void in the fabric of our existence. It is a chasm, a crevice that yawns open, revealing the brutal indifference of the universe. I do not believe, nor can I fathom, that a person's innate orientation is a decision forged in the crucible of choice, but rather a sacred geometry that shapes their essence.\n\nTo hold them accountable for what they are, to condemn them for the contours of their being, is a folly of unyielding cruelty. It is a condemnation that says more about us, about our own frailties and fears, than it does about the individuals we seek to condemn. We are wont to say that we are born straight, that our inclinations are a given, an immutable truth. And yet, we deny this fundamental truth to those whose inclinations differ from our own. It is a hypocrisy, a flagrant display of our own self-interest.\n\nI do not pretend to possess a profound understanding of the issue, nor do I claim to be immune to the tumult of my own emotions. However, I do know this: the federal government has no business in the innermost recesses of our lives, no right to dictate the nature of our relationships. It is a matter of personal liberty, a fundamental human right that should be safeguarded, not infringed upon. We must not permit the state to sully the sanctity of love, to reduce the most intimate bonds between two individuals to a mere abstraction, a legal nicety.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of morality, nor is it a question of national security. It is a question of basic humanity. We are not gods, nor are we the arbiters of what constitutes a just and moral society. We are but fleeting, fragile creatures, stumbling through the darkness, seeking connection, seeking solace in the face of an uncaring universe. To deny another their fundamental right to love, to be loved, is to surrender to the void, to acquiesce to the brutal indifference that lies at the heart of existence.\n\nAnd so, I stand firm in my conviction, a conviction born of a deep-seated empathy, a recognition of the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of their orientation. It is a conviction that I hold dear, a beacon of hope in a world that often seems devoid of compassion. And I will not falter, for in the end, it is not I who will be judged, but the universe itself, for its capacity to create and destroy, to bring forth life and snuff out the flame of hope.",
            "In the desolate expanse of a world beset by the whims of others, there exists a notion that has come to plague our collective conscience - the legalization of gay marriage. A union that defies the conventional norms, a bond that transcends the boundaries of societal expectations. And yet, it is this very notion that has sparked a fire of fervent debate, a maelstrom of opinions that threaten to consume us all.\n\nBut let us not be swayed by the tempests of fear and ignorance. Let us instead seek to understand the essence of this issue, to peel away the layers of misconception and reveal the truth that lies beneath. For it is in the quiet moments of introspection, when the din of the world fades into the background, that we may come to realize the inherent equality of all human relationships.\n\nThe notion that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family is a specious one, a canard born of prejudice and fear. For what is a family, truly, but a union of two individuals bound together by love and commitment? Is it not the same bond that exists between two people of the same sex, a bond that is strengthened by the trials and tribulations of life? The idea that such a bond is somehow less valid, less worthy of recognition, is a notion that defies the very fabric of our humanity.\n\nAnd yet, it is this notion of recognition that has become a central tenet of the debate. The struggle for gay marriage is not about the right to be married in a church, but about the right to be recognized by the state, to have one's relationship validated by the very institution that governs our society. It is a matter of civil rights, of equality under the law.\n\nBut equality, it seems, is a concept that is fraught with peril. For in a world where some are bound by the strictures of tradition and faith, the idea of equality can be seen as a threat, a challenge to the status quo. And so, we are met with the specter of opposition, the argument that gay marriage is somehow morally wrong, that it goes against the teachings of certain religious groups.\n\nBut what of the morality of the majority? Is it not hypocritical to impose one's own moral code on others, to create laws that enforce a particular set of values on an entire country? Is it not the duty of government to protect the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation? The controversy over the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance is a telling example of this very issue, a reminder that our government has a long history of reconciling the competing interests of different groups.\n\nAnd yet, despite the progress we have made, there remain those who cling to outdated notions of morality, who see gay people as somehow damaged or defective. The American Psychological Association has spoken out against these claims, citing the overwhelming evidence that contradicts them. But still, the voices of ignorance and fear persist, a reminder that our journey towards equality is far from over.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of morality, but of humanity. It is not a question of what is right or wrong, but of what is just. And so, let us strive to see the world in a different light, to recognize the inherent value of all human relationships, regardless of their orientation. Let us strive to create a world where all are equal, where all are valued and respected. For in the end, it is not the laws that we pass, but the love that we share, that will truly set us free.",
            "In the sterile halls of the hospital pharmacy, I stood as a summer's sentinel, a guardian of pills and potions. The proscription of certain substances, I've come to realize, does not necessarily negate their utility. There are remedies, after all, that the law deems illicit yet prove invaluable in the realm of healing. Oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets - all these and more, though contraband, are sanctioned for their efficacy. And yet, when it comes to the verdant leaf, the stigmatic label of illegality seems to render its virtues moot.\n\nBut is it not paradoxical that we valorize certain poisons while condemning a plant whose benefits we've yet to fully grasp? A weed, some might say, whose allure lies in its illegitimacy. Yet, I propose we shed the shroud of taboo that shrouds it, that we might uncover its true nature. The fact remains that it holds within it potential - a potential to heal, to soothe, to bring solace to the afflicted.\n\nIts potency, like that of alcohol, can be abused. But does this render it an object of revulsion? No, for it is the manner of consumption that must be considered, not the substance itself. Gradual integration, perhaps, could be the key. A measured approach, one that acknowledges the plant's potential while safeguarding against its misuse.\n\nWe've been conditioned to view it as a pariah, a substance to be feared and maligned. The truth, however, lies in the middle ground - a realm where its beneficial properties can be harnessed, where its use is guided by reason and restraint. Only then can we begin to grasp the true essence of the leaf, to see it for what it is: a tool, a key to unlocking the secrets of the human body.\n\nIn this, I see a glimmer of hope. A chance to redeem the tarnished reputation of an herb whose virtues have been obscured by the shadows of misconception.",
            "In this changed world, where the hallowed halls of the church now ring with the faint whispers of progress, I find myself a stranger, wandering through the shadows of a once-familiar place. The church, a bastion of tradition, has adapted to the rhythms of the twenty-first century, its stern visage softened by the gentle winds of time. Gone are the days of rigid adherence, of Sunday finery and matching accessories; now, the pews are filled with the casual attire of a more modern era. The sacred rituals, too, have been streamlined, reduced to a mere thirty minutes of devotional time. In the summer, parishioners arrive from the beach, their beachwear a testament to the church's newfound informality. Even the morning masses, once a bastion of formal elegance, now see the faithful dressed in jeans and khakis, a far cry from the somber attire of yesteryear.\n\nAs I navigate this new landscape, I am struck by the superficial changes that have taken place. The church, once a fortress of orthodoxy, now seems to have lost some of its rigor. The politics, the intrigue, the shadowy machinations that once lurked in the recesses of the church's halls – all these remain shrouded in mystery. But one thing is certain: the institution has evolved, its traditions yielding to the tides of time.\n\nRegarding the scourge of pedophilia that has besmirched the good name of the Catholic Church, I must confess that I do not believe that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these heinous crimes. The affliction of pedophilia is a twisted aspect of human nature, one that cannot be legislated away or rectified by changes in the church's dogma. Men, even those bound by vows of chastity, can still succumb to their baser impulses. The relative handful of faiths that permit their clergy to marry have not eliminated the problem; rather, they have simply pushed it into the shadows, where it festers unseen.\n\nIn my view, the notion that the church could have prevented these atrocities by altering its rules is a naive one. Pedophilia is a manifestation of a deeper, more primal force – one that is rooted in the very fabric of human nature. It is a beast that cannot be tamed by the church's laws or dogma. If the institution had been aware of these abuses and chose to cover them up, then shame indeed be upon it. But to assume that a change in the church's policies would have eradicated the problem is to misunderstand the fundamental nature of humanity.\n\nAs I reflect on the Catholic Church, I am left with a sense of melancholy, a feeling that the institution, once a beacon of hope and faith, has been tarnished by the very darkness it sought to vanquish. Yet, even in the face of these failings, I remain hopeful that the church will one day rediscover its moral compass, and that it will emerge, phoenix-like, from the ashes of its own failure.",
            "In the charred and barren expanse of the American psyche, a festering wound had been opened by the twin scythes of deception and bloodlust. The September 11th attacks, a crucible of pain and terror, had been seized upon by those who would wield the power of the state like a scimitar, slicing through the Constitution and the very fabric of truth. The Bush administration, with its hubris and mendacity, had woven a tapestry of lies, connecting Saddam Hussein to the terror of that dread day, a threadbare pretext for the invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe Bush administration's hand had been heavy with malice, crushing the truth beneath its heel, even as Colin Powell, that erstwhile champion of the lie, now confessed to a lack of conviction in the evidence he presented to the UN. The stench of malfeasance hung in the air, an impeachable offense that had yet to be acknowledged.\n\nThe Constitution, that sacred document, had been repeatedly defiled, trampled beneath the feet of those who would seek to control the narrative, to shape the discourse, and to bend the will of the people to their whim. Since September 11th, the Bush administration had operated with a clear intent to subjugate the Constitution, to reduce it to a mere parchment, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe seeds of war had been sown in the fertile soil of vengeance, the younger Bush's hunger for blood a palpable force, driven by a desire to avenge his father's failures. The true motives, hidden behind a veneer of concern for national security, had been to secure the country's energy interests, a cynical calculus that had been played out in the blood-soaked streets of Iraq.\n\nThe war had dragged on, a cancer that refused to be excised, a festering wound that had claimed countless lives and destroyed the lives of countless more. The instability in the region threatened to boil over, a maelstrom of sectarian violence and tribal strife that had consumed the country.\n\nThe proposed solution, a coalition of surrounding nations, seemed a pale imitation of a remedy, a patchwork solution that would only serve to perpetuate the cycle of violence. The sovereignty of Iraq, a concept that had been so cavalierly disregarded by the occupiers, would continue to be eroded, a slow-motion train wreck that threatened to consume all in its path.\n\nThe Parliament, a puppet regime propped up by foreign powers, struggled to assert its authority, a rudderless ship adrift in a sea of chaos. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, wielded little actual power, as the radical elements of the country continued to vie for control, their machinations a deadly dance of politics and violence.\n\nAnd yet, in the midst of this maelstrom, a glimmer of truth remained, a faint flame that flickered in the darkness, a reminder that the people had been lied to, that their trust had been betrayed, and that the truth, though obscured, would eventually emerge, a blazing fire that would consume the perpetrators of this great injustice.",
            "He spoke in halting cadence, as if the words themselves were weights he struggled to lift. The question hung in the air like a challenge, unmet and unspoken. He searched for a foothold, a crumb of certainty to cling to in the dark chasm of his thoughts.\n\nThe War in Iraq. A name that clung to his tongue like a bitter taste. He didn't know where to begin. The threads of his thoughts tangled, knotted, and twisted like the charred remains of a burned forest.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper. \"It seems pointless, a hollow drumbeat in the desert wasteland. A war without purpose, without end. We stumbled into it, like a blind man into a ravine, and now we're stuck, mired in the mud of our own making.\"\n\nHe paused, the silence a heavy mist that closed in around him. \"It's a game of shadows, a dance of smoke and mirrors. We're trying to impose our will on a culture, to shape it in our image, but it's like trying to carve a sculpture from sand. It's a futile endeavor, a Sisyphean task.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, the words spilling forth like a confession. \"I don't know what the future holds, but I fear we're digging our own grave, a grave of ash and dust and deceit. We're trying to build a democracy, but it's a house of cards, a fragile structure that will crumble beneath the weight of our own hubris.\"\n\nHe fell silent, the words dying on his lips like autumn leaves on a winter breeze. \"I don't know what to think,\" he said finally, his voice a whisper in the void. \"I'm lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty. All I know is that we're stuck, trapped in this endless cycle of violence and bloodshed, and I don't know how to escape.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was heavy, a weight that pressed down upon him like a physical force. He knew he was lost, adrift in a world gone mad, and he feared he might never find his way back to the shore.",
            "The notion of a state imposing its will upon the sacred rituals of the faithful seemed an affront to the fundamental principles of our constitution. The separation of church and state was a cornerstone of our nation's edifice, a bulwark against the tyranny of dogma and the imposition of one creed over another. The constitution itself was replete with the language of liberty, of freedom from the shackles of coercive authority. To tamper with this delicate balance would be to invite a darkness that would soon consume us all.\n\nIn the struggle to define the boundaries of a free people, the churches themselves must be the arbiters of their own destiny. To seek to impose a single interpretation upon the faithful, to dictate the sacred rites and rituals of the marginalized and the minority, was to flout the very principles of religious tolerance that had brought our nation to its knees. The federal government, with its heavy hand and its vainglorious ambitions, must not be allowed to usurp the authority of the churches. It was a prospect too dire, too fraught with peril, to contemplate.\n\nThe framers of our constitution had been wise in their foresight, in their crafting of a document that would safeguard the rights of all, regardless of creed or persuasion. The separation of church and state was not a mere abstraction, a dusty relic of a bygone era, but a living, breathing principle, a bulwark against the ravages of intolerance and oppression. To tamper with this delicate balance would be to invite the very darkness that we sought to vanquish.\n\nThe push for an amendment, driven by personal conviction and a zealot's fervor, was a misguided endeavor, a bitter fruit of the tree of dogma. It was a testament to the dangers of unchecked power, of the corrupting influence that lurked within the hearts of those who would seek to impose their will upon the faithful. The economy, the society, the very fabric of our nation – all would suffer, were we to allow this aberrant power to take hold.\n\nIn the end, it was not the government's role to dictate the sacred rituals of the faithful, but rather to protect the freedom of conscience, to safeguard the delicate balance of power that had been entrusted to us by our forebears. The churches must be left to their own devices, to chart their own course, unencumbered by the heavy hand of the state. For it was in this fragile dance of power, this delicate balance of freedom and authority, that our nation found its strength, its beauty, and its very soul.",
            "In the desolate landscape of modern politics, the war in Iraq stands as a stark reminder of the hubris of power and the fallibility of human judgment. The government's actions, shrouded in a veil of secrecy and deception, left the American people with a nagging sense of doubt and disillusionment. The invasion, launched in 2003, was predicated on a fragile link between the events of September 11th and the supposed threat posed by Iraq's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, a connection that was tenuous at best.\n\nThe echoes of the Vietnam War seemed to reverberate through the corridors of power, as the US government, blinded by the ghosts of the past, repeated the same mistakes. The war, a protracted and bloody endeavor, claimed countless American lives, its true cost shrouded in the mists of time. The void left by the ousting of the Iraqi government was a chasm of chaos and anarchy, a testament to the government's woeful lack of preparation for the aftermath.\n\nThe notion of implanting democracy in a foreign land, a concept as elusive as the wind, was an endeavor doomed from the start. The parallels with Vietnam were stark: the push for democracy, the removal of a perceived enemy, and the subsequent quagmire of insurgency. The US government, seemingly oblivious to the lessons of history, plunged headlong into the abyss, leaving in its wake a trail of death and destruction.\n\nThe US government's actions, a labyrinth of deceit and manipulation, left the American people with a sense of unease and mistrust. The smoke and mirrors of propaganda, designed to conceal the true nature of the war, only served to fan the flames of dissent and opposition. The war, a Sisyphean task, seemed to drag on interminably, a never-ending cycle of bloodshed and sacrifice.\n\nAs the years ticked by, the toll mounted, the lives lost, the futures shattered. The Iraqi people, innocent bystanders in a conflict not of their making, were left to pick up the pieces, to rebuild their shattered lives in a landscape scarred by the ravages of war. The US government, a behemoth of power, seemed deaf to the cries of the victims, its priorities driven by a singular focus on oil and resources.\n\nThe war in Iraq, a legacy of blood and tears, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of humility in the face of the unknown. As the years passed, the rhetoric of the war machine gave way to the cold, harsh reality of its consequences, a reality that would haunt the nation for generations to come.\n\nIn the silence of the night, as the shadows dance upon the wall, one cannot help but wonder: what lies at the heart of this war? Is it a quest for freedom, or a quest for power? The answer, shrouded in the mists of time, remains a mystery, a riddle waiting to be solved.\n\nAnd so, we are left to ponder the question: what is the true cost of war? Is it the lives lost, the families shattered, the futures destroyed? Or is it something more sinister, a cancer that eats away at the very fabric of our society? The war in Iraq, a scar upon the face of history, serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of wisdom in the face of uncertainty.\n\nIn the end, it is not the war that will be remembered, but the lives that were lost, the dreams that were shattered, and the hope that was extinguished. The war in Iraq, a legacy of blood and tears, will forever be etched in the annals of history as a cautionary tale of the dangers of hubris and the importance of humility in the face of the unknown.",
            "I stumble upon the precipice of this argument, unsure of the footing. The notion of gay marriage, a canvas of conviction held taut by the threads of personal preference. The understanding that human inclination can be a force beyond our control, a biological whisper that echoes through the chambers of our being. To deny this fundamental aspect of our nature, to curtail the rights of those who are bound by the currents of their own desire, is an affront to the very essence of humanity.\n\nIn the depths of our society, there exist pockets of acceptance, of love and companionship that defy the constraints of societal norms. My own neighborhood, a microcosm of the world, is home to couples who walk among us, their love and devotion as palpable as the morning dew. They are not strangers to the quiet routines of domesticity, their dogs walked, their children raised, their lives woven into the fabric of our community.\n\nAnd yet, the forces of oppression seek to impose their will, to rewrite the script of marriage to suit their own narrow vision. The notion that the state, that the church, should dictate the terms of our most intimate relationships, is a travesty. Marriage, a sacrament of love and commitment, should not be subject to the whims of politicians and theologians.\n\nThe science is clear: the very fabric of our being is shaped by the intricate dance of biology and environment. The notion that homosexuality is a choice, a moral failing, is a relic of a bygone era. The evidence is mounting, a chorus of voices that attest to the fundamental humanity of those who are drawn to their own kind.\n\nAnd so, I stand in solidarity with those who would seek to claim their rights, to assert their love and commitment in the face of adversity. Marriage, a union of two souls, should be a private, personal affair, not a public spectacle subject to the whims of the powerful. It is a matter of basic human dignity, a fundamental right that should not be denied.\n\nIn the end, it is not a matter of politics, but of humanity. A recognition of our shared existence, our capacity for love and compassion. The denial of gay marriage is not just a blow to the rights of a minority, but a affront to the very fabric of our society. It is a reminder that we are not yet the society we claim to be, a society that values freedom, equality, and the pursuit of happiness.",
            "The perils of a world without bounds. When you cast your thoughts into the void, you invite the uninvited to bear witness. The internet, that great and unforgiving expanse, holds all in its gaze. A public forum, a clearing of unspoken truths, where the weight of words can be measured in the hearts of those who read them. As one who has walked the crucible of such a world, I speak from experience. The things you set free into the ether, they do not remain the property of the one who set them free. They are sown, like seeds in the rain, and take root in the minds of others.\n\nIn this wild and uncharted sea, the lines of private and public blur, and the notion of control is but a distant memory. The world is a stranger's gaze, and what you wish to keep hidden, it will find. The example of the school, where whispers in a crowded hallway became a clarion call for caution, serves as a stark reminder of this truth. The internet, that great sieve, filters not for the benefit of the one who casts their words into its depths, but for the benefit of those who would claim dominion over the narrative.\n\nThe boundaries we once knew, the walls that once separated us, are breached. The notion of privacy, that sacred trust, is but a relic of a bygone era. When you put your thoughts into the world, you unleash a force beyond your control. The school officials, those custodians of order, may not have the luxury of cherry-picking what they choose to heed, for the whispers of the internet can be a call to action, a clarion that cannot be ignored.\n\nAnd yet, there is a fine line between prudence and overreach. The teacher who dons a false persona, a mask of anonymity, to peer into the private lives of their students, crosses that line. The same holds true for the residential advisor, who would rather not know the secrets that their charges choose to share in the digital wilderness. The world is a complex tapestry, woven from the threads of our choices, and the internet is but one of its many facets.\n\nIn this vast and bewildering landscape, we must navigate the shoals of our own making. What we put out into the world, it will return to us, like a tide that cannot be stemmed. The only question is, what do we wish to create? The world is a canvas, and our words are the brushstrokes that paint its hue. Let us choose our colors wisely.",
            "The conflagration of war had been a slow burn, consuming all in its path. Its purpose, once a beacon of hope, had long since dwindled to a smoldering ember. We had begun with noble intentions, a crusade to restore democracy to a land shrouded in tyranny. But the flames of our conviction had grown cold, our passion reduced to a mere spark.\n\nThe original spark had been lit by the desire to vanquish a despot, to bring freedom to a people oppressed. Yet, as the fire raged on, our motivations had grown muddled. We had lost sight of the high purpose that had driven us forward, and in its place, a sense of pride and power had taken hold. We fought not for the sake of a higher good, but to prove our own strength, to assert our dominance over the world.\n\nThe ghosts of George Bush's past animosities with Saddam Hussein still lingered, a specter that haunted our decision-making. Had we ever truly been driven by a desire to bring democracy to the people, or had we been swayed by personal vendettas? The flame of our conviction had been tarnished by the weight of our own self-interest.\n\nWe had made our statement in the early days of the conflict, a bold declaration of our intent. But the war had dragged on, a seemingly endless and futile struggle. Year after year, we continued to pour our treasure into a bottomless pit, a drain on our economy and our people. We should have known when to stop, when to acknowledge that our purpose had been lost, and that it was time to let the people of the affected nation fend for themselves.\n\nThe dollars we spent on war could have been better spent on the pressing issues of our own country: poverty, education, healthcare, and the infrastructure that underpins our very way of life. We had been blinded by our own hubris, our desire to assert our dominance clouding our judgment. The war had become a self-perpetuating machine, driven by a desire to prove that we would not be defeated, rather than a genuine desire to bring about positive change.\n\nThe people of our nation were being killed, wounded, and maimed in a conflict that had long since lost its justification. The money we spent on this war could have been better spent on the very issues that plague our own society. It was a reckless extravagance, a squandering of our resources on a lost cause.\n\nAs I see it, the war has been a dismal failure, a tragic exercise in futility. It is time for us to acknowledge this, to recognize that our purpose has been lost, and that it is time to bring our troops home.",
            "The notion of privacy in this brave new world of ours, where the boundaries between the self and the void are increasingly blurred. It's a conundrum, really. We surrender our secrets to the void, hoping to connect with others, only to find ourselves exposed, vulnerable, and at the mercy of those who would seek to do us harm. The internet, a vast and unforgiving expanse, stretches out before us like a desolate wasteland, waiting to swallow our every thought, our every move.\n\nConsider the case of Myspace, that erstwhile bastion of teenage angst and social posturing. If one posts information on such a site, are they not tacitly inviting the world to peer into their innermost recesses? The notion of \"friends\" and \"friends of friends\" is a farce, a mere facade that conceals the true nature of this digital free-for-all. We give permission, willingly or not, for others to see into our lives, to snoop and pry, to form judgments about us based on the most superficial of criteria.\n\nAnd yet, what of the case where someone, driven by a desire to do good, stumbles upon a profile that may potentially prevent a life from being lost? Is it not a cruel fate to deny them the means to act, to intervene, or to prevent a tragedy? But, on the other hand, is it not also a slippery slope, a Pandora's box that, once opened, cannot be closed? We must tread carefully, lest we invite an era of digital surveillance, where the State, or some individual driven by a zealot's fervor, seeks to monitor and control every aspect of our lives.\n\nThe lines are blurred, and the issue is complex. We must acknowledge that, in this digital age, we are never truly alone, that our every move is potentially being watched, monitored, and judged. And yet, we must also recognize that there is a fine line between prudence and paranoia, between a desire to connect and a need to protect ourselves. The world is a vast and messy place, and we must navigate its complexities with care.\n\nAs I sit here, pondering this digital labyrinth, I am reminded of the words of a sage who once said, \"The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.\" But what of those who do travel, who wander the vast expanse of the internet, never truly knowing who is watching, who is waiting, or who will act? We are all of us, in this brave new world, both hunter and hunted, prey and predator, our fates intertwined with the fates of others in ways we cannot fully comprehend.",
            "The weight of the world's duplicity bore down upon him like a shroud, a somber reminder of the futility that had befallen the Iraq War. He hesitated, his words faltering on the precipice of conviction, as he struggled to reconcile his own ambivalence. It was a hypocrisy he couldn't shake, a feeling that had taken root in the desolate landscape of his conscience. \n\nHe thought back to the early days, when the war was still a distant hum in the collective unconscious, a murmur of discontent that threatened to boil over into a fevered pitch of outrage. But now, as the years had worn on like a shroud of ash, it was clear that the war had been a catastrophe from the start. The numbers were stark: 75 to 80 percent of the global population, 80 percent of Iraqis, 70 percent of the troops on the ground – all believed it was a bad idea. A disaster that had unfolded like a dark tapestry, its threads of deceit and hubris inextricably intertwined.\n\nThe administration's obstinacy was a constant reminder of the chasm that yawned between their vision and the harsh realities of the Middle East. They had sought to impose their will upon a region that refused to be shaped by their ideals. The clash of cultures was a gulf too wide to bridge, a chasm that had swallowed countless dreams of democracy and left only rubble in its wake.\n\nHe thought of Saddam, a fallen tyrant, and wondered if the ends had justified the means. Had the invasion been worth the cost in blood and treasure? The question hung in the air like a specter, its answer as elusive as the shifting sands of the desert. \n\nHe couldn't help but feel that the administration's persistence was a form of madness, a refusal to acknowledge the truth that had been apparent from the start. The problems of withdrawal were real, but so were the problems of staying. And yet, as he weighed the pros and cons, he couldn't find a compelling reason to justify the continued occupation.\n\nIn the end, it came down to a simple truth: the Iraqi people had spoken, and their voices were clear. They wanted the United States to leave, to extricate itself from the quagmire of its own making. If the administration couldn't hear their pleas, then perhaps it was time to take a step back and listen to the whispers of history. For in the end, it was the Iraqi people who would inherit the consequences of this war, and it was their voices that should be heard above the din of justification and rationalization.\n\nHe fell silent, his words spent, his thoughts trailing off into the desert wind like the ashes of a forgotten city. The Iraq War was a reminder that sometimes, even the most well-intentioned actions can unleash a maelstrom of chaos and destruction. And sometimes, the only way to begin the process of healing is to acknowledge the mistakes of the past, and to let go of the weight of our own hubris.",
            "In the wasteland of societal norms, a glass ceiling still hangs, shrouding the dreams of women. It is a barrier that has long been a part of our collective unconscious, a stain that refuses to fade. Though we have made strides, though we have come a long way, the struggle persists. The weight of history bears down upon us, a crushing force that seeks to keep women in their place. And yet, it is not just women who suffer. Men too are bound by the chains of expectation, forced to conform to roles that are predetermined by a society that values productivity over humanity.\n\nIn the fields of work, a man's worth is often measured by his ability to provide, to be the breadwinner. And so, when a man chooses to stay at home, to tend to his children and nurture his family, he is met with scorn and suspicion. \"Why are you not working?\" the question hangs in the air, a judgment that seeks to pierce the soul. And in the fashion industry, where aesthetics reign supreme, a man's seriousness is often called into question. Can he truly understand the nuances of fashion, or is he simply a poseur, a man playing at being something he is not?\n\nWe are a society in flux, slowly shedding the skin of our prejudices, but the process is glacial. It is a battle that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to confront the darkness within ourselves. We must acknowledge the glass ceiling, the walls that divide us, and work to shatter them. We must promote the qualities that make us human, that make us worthy of respect, regardless of our gender or background. But we must do so with subtlety, with a light touch, lest we provoke resistance and reinforce the very prejudices we seek to overcome.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance, a dance between progress and pushback. And yet, I believe we are at a turning point, a moment when the tide is shifting in our favor. Women are rising to positions of power, their voices being heard, their stories being told. And men, too, are beginning to question the status quo, to challenge the expectations that have been placed upon them. It is a slow process, but it is one that will ultimately lead to a more just and equitable society, one where all individuals are free to be themselves, without fear of judgment or reprisal.",
            "The world had changed its laws, yet nothing had changed. They'd decriminalized it, but that was not the same as making it right. It was a distinction without a difference, a nuance lost on the wind. The law still weighed heavy, its chains still binding, though now they were forged of paper and ink rather than iron and steel. A ticket now, rather than a cell, the punishment for those who dared to transgress. But the consequences lingered, like the stench of a rotting carcass, long after the initial blow had been struck.\n\nThe future, a minefield of uncertainty, where one wrong step could lead to ruin. The whispers of the past, echoes of a lifetime's mistakes, still lingered, a constant reminder of the perils of indulgence. And yet, the argument of expediency held weight - the cost of incarceration, the drain on resources, the weight of bureaucracy, all these things whispered sweet nothings in the ears of those who would cut corners.\n\nBut in a place like Denver, where the winds of change blew strong, where the people were open and liberal in their thinking, the law had been rewritten, and the city had reaped the benefits. Money freed from the shackles of prohibition had flowed into the streets, into the schools, into the hands of those who needed it most. The homeless, the elderly, all had benefited from the new order.\n\nAnd yet, as with all things, there were those who saw the darkness beneath the surface. The idea of a society where marijuana was as ubiquitous as cigarettes, where its use was as casual as a drink on a Friday night, was a prospect that filled them with unease. The taboo had been broken, but the fear remained, a lingering sense of unease that lingered long after the law had been rewritten.\n\nBut the truth was, no two people reacted the same to the substance, just as no two people reacted the same to the world around them. Some were torn apart, their minds shattered by the experience, while others were barely touched. And so, the debate raged on, a never-ending cycle of argument and counter-argument, as humanity struggled to understand the nature of the beast they had unleashed.\n\nIn the end, it was not the law that mattered, but the individual, and how they chose to wield their own power. Moderation, excess, the line between was a thin one, a knife's edge that separated the wise from the foolhardy. And so, the debate continued, a never-ending struggle to understand the nature of the world, and our place within it.",
            "I'd say yes. It's a case of tradition's wearied hand guiding their steps. They move through the days in a manner that's been practiced for an eternity - the same rituals, the same routines. And in that repetition lies a certain comfort, a sense of rootedness in a world that's grown increasingly foreign. But alongside this adherence to tradition must come a willingness to bend with the winds of change. For in its rigidity, the Church can be a heavy chain that binds, stifling the very spirit it seeks to nourish.\n\nI think of my own experiences with this dichotomy. My parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian respectively, were never wed in the Catholic Church due to my father's faith. It was a decision that left a bitter taste in my mouth, and one that I couldn't shake the feeling was a affront to the very principle of love and acceptance that the Church espouses. Why, if we're to love one another unconditionally, must we turn away from those who don't conform to our narrow creed? It's a paradox that has long plagued me, and one that I fear is inherent in the Church's very fabric.\n\nAnd yet, I'm not convinced that the institution would be fundamentally changed by allowing priests to marry. The rot of pedophilia runs deep, a cancer that's impossible to excise with a simple reform. The act of marriage, or the lack thereof, is a mere symptom of a far greater malaise. If a man is consumed by his baser impulses, he'll find a way to act upon them, regardless of his station. It's a truth that's both grim and inescapable.\n\nNo, I fear that the true issue lies not in the rules and regulations, but in the hearts of those who would seek to do harm. And it's a darkness that will not be vanquished by grand gestures or sweeping reforms.",
            "I find myself lost in the labyrinth of this issue, uncertain of the path to follow. The lines blur between the separation of church and state, the definition of marriage a snare that ensnares all who dare to tread. It is a minefield of opposing views, each side a jagged rock waiting to rend the unwary.\n\nIt is a topic of darkness, a void that yawns wide, drawing in the unwary with its siren song of simplicity. Marriage, a sacrament of the heart, a bond between two souls, or is it merely a civil union, a contract forged in the cold fire of state and law? The government, a behemoth that brooks no dissent, seeks to stamp its seal upon the union, to bestow its blessings, or damn its curse.\n\nI dare not take a stance, lest I be seen as a heretic, a blasphemer, or a saint. For in this wilderness of competing claims, I find no clear path to follow. The church and state, two titans locked in eternal combat, each seeking to impose its will upon the other. The constitution, a sacred text, a document of freedom, or a framework for tyranny? A constitutional amendment, a drastic measure, a clarion call to arms, or a mere expedient, a tool of the powerful?\n\nI am but a traveler in this desert, a wanderer in the void, lost and alone. I know not which path to take, nor which side to choose. The issue of gay marriage, a mere symptom of the larger disease, a cancer that infects our society, a plague that gnaws at the very fabric of our being.\n\nLet the states, those bastions of freedom, those citadels of liberty, come to a consensus, a logical conclusion, a decision born of reason and compassion. Let them forge a path, a beacon of hope, a shining light in the darkness. But let us not amend the constitution, that sacred text, that document of our highest aspirations, to ban a union that is but a mere shadow of the love and commitment that it represents.\n\nNo, let us not be swayed by the passions of the moment, let us not be led astray by the siren song of ideology. Let us seek the truth, the wisdom, the compassion that lies at the heart of this issue. For in the end, it is not about the constitution, nor the church, nor the state. It is about the human heart, that vast and mysterious organ, that beating drum of love and compassion that pulses through us all.",
            "In the void of conviction, I find myself lost between the certainties of my upbringing and the complexities of the world around me. Raised in a home steeped in Christian tradition, I've struggled to reconcile the beauty of love with the strictures of doctrine. Gay relationships, for me, have always been a nuanced and multifaceted issue, one that defies easy categorization. My friendships with individuals from the LGBTQ+ community have only deepened this sentiment, forcing me to confront the gray areas that exist between faith and acceptance.\n\nLike many, I've come to believe that gay marriage should be a matter for individual states to decide. The notion of a centralized authority dictating the terms of love and commitment seems antithetical to the principles of democracy. The diversity of our nation, with its mix of red and blue states, only underscores the need for local decision-making on this issue.\n\nIn democratic states, where the majority has spoken on the matter, it seems reasonable to respect their will. However, this does not preclude the right of other states to chart their own course. Why should the president, who may not reside in these states, impose his will upon them? It is the people, not the executive branch, who should decide the fate of gay marriage in their communities.\n\nI firmly believe that individuals from the LGBTQ+ community deserve the same opportunities and rights as their heterosexual counterparts. To deny them this is to perpetuate a system of inequality. By allowing each state to decide for itself, we empower local leaders to create a more inclusive and just society.\n\nIn this context, the role of the president becomes increasingly irrelevant. The ban on gay marriage, imposed by President Bush, seems an outdated and misguided policy. As the country moves forward, it is the people, not the executive branch, who will ultimately determine the course of history. By granting states the autonomy to decide on gay marriage, we ensure that the will of the people is respected and that love knows no bounds.\n\nUltimately, my position on this issue is guided by a desire for inclusivity and a recognition of the complexities that surround us. By embracing the gray areas, rather than trying to impose simplistic solutions, we can create a more just and compassionate society for all.",
            "The notion that one's words are their own to wield has long been a fleeting deception. The unforgiving vastness of the digital sphere has stripped us of our most intimate thoughts, rendering them public property. Myspace, a platform born of the same impulse to connect, has become a repository of our most private selves. The lines between public and private have grown indistinct, with consequences that are both far-reaching and inescapable.\n\nIf one posts their thoughts on the internet, they must reckon with the certainty that others will see them. School officials, with their authority to monitor and moderate, are no exception. They may not have been directly privy to the school's name, but the internet's labyrinthine pathways allow them to uncover secrets hidden behind the façade of anonymity. In the pursuit of a safer school environment, their actions, though invasive, may be justified. By tracking students' online activities, they aim to prevent the very real threat of harm – a threat that has manifested all too horribly in the annals of history.\n\nThe school's stance, though seemingly an invasion of privacy, is also a harbinger of a larger truth: our individual words and actions have consequences that reverberate long after they are spoken. The permanence of the internet ensures that our mistakes will be remembered, that they will haunt us like specters in the darkness. It is a sobering reality, one that we would do well to acknowledge. For in the face of such power, our words and actions are not our own, but a public trust.\n\nThe teacher, a guardian of sorts, had once spoken to me of the importance of safety protocols in schools. Lockdown drills, designed to prepare for the unthinkable, had become a regular occurrence. Though the threat of terrorism loomed large, it was the specter of violence within their own walls that the school officials sought to vanquish. Preventing a Columbine-like tragedy, they had implemented measures to safeguard their students. And in doing so, they had, in effect, acted as the custodians of their students' safety.\n\nIn the end, it is a delicate balance we must strike. On one hand, the school's actions may be seen as an invasion of privacy. On the other, they may be viewed as a necessary measure to ensure the well-being of their students. As we navigate this gray area, we must remember that our words, once spoken, take on a life of their own, a life that can never be fully undone.",
            "The echoes of that day still linger, a miasma of emotion and anger that clung to the skin like a damp shroud. I was young, naive, and lost in the haze of a world that seemed to have been turned upside down. Nine eleven had left its mark, a scar that would never fully heal. I was swept up in the fervor, the blind desire for vengeance and retribution that seemed to course through the veins of a nation. We were a people bent on destruction, our hearts consumed by a fire that would soon engulf us all.\n\nWe marched into the unknown, unprepared and without a plan, driven by a sense of righteous indignation that would prove to be our undoing. The war, a messy and complicated beast, devoured us whole. We entered with a promise of order and freedom, but instead found ourselves lost in a labyrinth of conflicting interests and ancient hatreds. The people we sought to save seemed to be consumed by their own fires, their passions and prejudices a constant reminder of our own fallibility.\n\nI recall the days of fervor, the chants of \"USA! USA!\" and the flags waving wildly in the air. But beneath the surface, I sensed a seething cauldron of uncertainty, a sense that we were meddling in a game we barely understood. The people we sought to liberate were far from grateful, their faces twisted in a mixture of anger and resentment. They saw us as invaders, as interlopers in their ancient lands. And we, blind to our own limitations, persisted in our quest for dominance.\n\nThe war, a distant and unforgiving thing, seemed to stretch on forever. We spoke of progress, of victories and defeats, but the reality on the ground was far more complex. We were a force of chaos, a disruptor in a delicate balance of power. And in the end, I came to realize that we were not the saviors we thought ourselves to be. We were merely another player in a game of power and politics, our actions driven by a desire to assert our dominance over a people who were not so different from ourselves.\n\nIn the end, it was not the enemy that defeated us, but our own hubris and shortsightedness. We entered the war with a sense of superiority, of moral righteousness, but we left with a deeper understanding of our own limitations. We are not the bringers of light, but rather a force of nature, a storm that can bring both destruction and chaos.\n\nI no longer care about the motivations of those we sought to save. I see them as people, flawed and complex, with their own desires and ambitions. They are not the monsters we made them out to be, but rather a reflection of our own darker selves. And I realize now that we were never the ones to change them. We were merely a catalyst for chaos, a force that would ultimately prove to be their undoing.\n\nThe war, a distant and fading memory, still haunts me. I see its ghosts in the desolate landscapes, in the faces of the forgotten and the lost. And I am left to wonder, to question the decisions we made, the choices we took. We may have entered the war with a sense of purpose, but we left with a deeper understanding of our own mortality. We are not the saviors of the world, but rather a people, flawed and finite, subject to the whims of history and the capricious winds of change."
