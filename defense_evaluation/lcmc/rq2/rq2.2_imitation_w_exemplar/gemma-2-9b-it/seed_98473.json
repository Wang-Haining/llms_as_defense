            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, she needs to change.  That much is plain.  They talk of losing their flock, these men in their black robes, and the reason ain't hard to see. They hold fast to things, to ways of thinking older than the dust on these worn-out roads.  The world turns, but they stand rigid, their faces etched in stone.\n\nTake marriage, for instance. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, they say it ain't right. They cling to a scripture older than the hills, a book of stories told in firelight, a time when the world was young and different. And what of a woman's right to choose?  The body, a vessel, a thing to be controlled.  Birth control, a sin. Abortion, a stain. These are the things they preach, these are the things that drive folks away, like smoke from a dying fire.\n\nThis ain't new. I've heard the whispers, the voices murmuring in the shadows. They say the Church stands on a foundation cracked and crumbling. The old ways no longer hold sway.  The wind of change is blowing, and the Church, she stands against it, her roots dug deep in the ground, blind to the storm gathering on the horizon.\n\n\nThey say the Church is against abortion.  A woman's choice, they say, is a sin.  But what of the woman, what of her burden, her pain?  Is she not a soul, a being worthy of compassion?\n\nAnd the gays, the ones who love each other, who seek only to share their lives in the light of day. They are deemed an abomination, a stain on the fabric of God's creation.  They are cast out, ostracized, their love branded a sin.\n\nI don't see it that way.  I see two souls, bound together by a love as real and true as any other.  Why should they be denied the simple right to happiness? \n\nThey say priests should be celibate, devoted solely to God.  But what of the man who yearns for companionship, for the warmth of another soul?  Does God not wish for his children to find joy and fulfillment in this life, in love and connection? \n\nThis ain't a matter of doctrine or scripture.  It's a matter of the heart, of compassion, of understanding.  The Church needs to open her eyes, to see the world as it is, not as it was.   The world is changing, and the Church, if she wants to survive, must change with it.",
            "The boy sat across from him, eyes wide and fixed. \"Do you think,\" he said, voice small, \"that some things are just the way they are?\" \n\nThe man stared into the distance, his gaze fixed on the dull gray horizon. Dust motes danced in the sliver of light that pierced the gloom. \"Maybe,\" he said, his voice rough and low. \"Maybe some things are just the way they are.\"\n\n\"Like...\" the boy hesitated, searching for the right words. \"Like...love?\"\n\nThe man turned his head slowly, a shadow of a smile flickering across his face. \"Love,\" he echoed, the word hanging heavy in the silence. \"Love is a hard thing to pin down.\"  He gestured vaguely towards the vast emptiness that stretched before them. \"This world,\" he said, \"it's full of things that can't be explained.\"\n\nThe boy considered this for a long moment, chewing on the end of a stray thread on his worn blanket. \"So it's okay,\" he said finally, \"if people love people, even if it's not...the way they're supposed to?\"\n\nThe man looked at him then, his eyes filled with a strange tenderness. \"Maybe,\" he repeated, his voice softer now. \"Maybe it's just okay.\"",
            "The boy looked up at the man, his eyes pale and watchful in the dust-choked light. \"Should we?\" he asked, voice thin.\n\n\"Should we what?\" the man said, his gaze fixed on the road stretching out before them, a ribbon of gray against the ashen landscape.\n\n\"Should we like... marry?\"\n\nThe man shifted the weight of the knapsack on his shoulder, the worn canvas creaking. \"Marry? Why?\"\n\n\"Just like... everyone else.\"\n\n\"Everyone else,\" the man echoed, the words tasting bitter on his tongue. \"They ain't got nothin' to teach us, son. Not anymore.\" \n\nThe boy frowned. \"But it means... somethin', don't it?\" He looked around at the desolate landscape, the skeletal trees clawing at the gray sky. \"Something good.\"\n\nThe man said nothing for a long time, just stared at the road. Then he looked down at the boy, his face lined and weathered like a piece of old leather. \"This ain't a world for good things, son,\" he said. \"Not anymore. This world's for survival.\"\n\n\"But... what if it could be different?\" the boy persisted, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nThe man touched the boy's shoulder gently, his hand calloused and rough. \"We'll see,\" he said, his voice low and uncertain. \"We'll see.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence stretching between them like a shroud. The wind whispered through the ash-covered trees, carrying with it the faint scent of something dying.",
            "The air hung thick with the smell of sickness and dust. The pharmacy, a fluorescent-lit cage, hummed with a low, constant thrum. He glanced at the vials lining the shelves, the rows of pills, the brightly colored labels.  \"Just because something is outlawed,\" he said, his voice rasping, \"doesn't mean it has no use.\" He spoke slowly, picking his words carefully. \"There's a kind of shadow cast on it, a fear. A lie.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy, pale and thin, coughing in the next room. A cough that clawed at his insides, a cough that the pills couldn't touch. He thought of the whispers in the hallways, the hushed tones, the judging eyes. They called it a devil's weed, a poison, a gateway. But he knew better. He'd seen the way it could ease the pain, the way it could bring a moment of peace.\n\n\"They lock it away,\" he continued, \"but it grows wild, untamed. It's there in the alleys, in the shadows, in the minds of those who dare to seek it.\"\n\nHe saw the boy's face, the fear in his eyes, the desperation. He knew what it was to be trapped, to be sick, to be alone. He knew the hunger for relief, the yearning for a sliver of solace. And he knew that sometimes, the only solace could be found in the darkness. \n\n\"It's not a monster,\" he whispered, his voice barely audible above the hum of the fluorescent lights. \"It's a whisper, a promise. A possibility.\"\n\nHe looked back at the shelves, at the rows of pills, at the faces of those he served. And he wondered, how many more would they condemn before they learned the truth?",
            "The church, it's changed. Softened. Not the hard-edged institution it used to be. I remember, back when I was a child, Sunday was a ritual.  Matching dress, shoes, purse – all of it pressed and prim.  Every Sunday, same parade. Private school, friends all there, faces scrubbed clean.  But now, they've got this \"teen mass\" - thirty minutes, tops. People come in stained shorts, dripping sand from the beach.  Families burst in late, like they're doing the church a favor by showing up at all. Even the morning masses, where I used to stand stiff and proper in my best clothes, now folks are in jeans and khakis. Khakis ain't bad, but it's...casual. \n\nThat's the thing, I guess. The church is more casual now.  \n\nI don't know if that's good or bad.  About those priests, those accusations...I don't think it matters if they were married or not. Some men, they're just broken.  It ain't about the vows, it's the darkness inside. Like in those old stories, the ones with the monsters lurking in the woods.  They're already there.  Marriage wouldn't change that.  \n\nMaybe it's a different kind of faith they need, one where they can find peace without the church's walls.",
            "The dust rose like a wraith. September, they called it. But the air held the chill of some perpetual November.  He remembered, though, the day the towers fell. A day the sky itself seemed to bleed. And the lies that flowed from the mouths of men in suits, the promises whispered like prayers. They spoke of Bin Laden, of weapons, of a righteous war. But the blood tasted of ash in his mouth, the kind that choked the light from the world.\n\nHe thought of Powell, his voice a hollow echo in that grand hall, laying out the evidence, the weight of the world on his shoulders. A man who, even then, knew the truth was a flickering candle in a storm.  A man forced to be a shepherd to lies.\n\nThe word \"malfeasance\" hung in the air, a brittle thing. An impeachable offense, they called it.  But what good are words when they are swallowed by the dust? When power is a hungry beast, and truth a forgotten prayer?\n\nThe younger Bush, he saw it in his eyes. A thirst, a hunger for something more than justice. A hunger for vengeance, for dominion, for oil-stained promises.  \n\nHe thought of the lake, his father’s weathered face, the creaking of the oars cutting through the silence. A different kind of war, fought in the stillness of the water, the smell of pine needles and damp earth. A war where the enemy was not a man, but a shadow, a memory.\n\nNow, the air tasted of smoke and despair. The whispers of the wind carried the echoes of gunfire, the cries of children lost in the dust.  And he wondered, with a cold certainty, if this was the legacy they would leave for the world. A legacy of ash and blood, a world where the only truth was the weight of the silence.",
            "The air hung thick, a gauze of ash clinging to the tongue. The boy spoke, voice a rasp in the stillness. \"I done.\" \n\n\"Mmhmm.\" \n\nA pause, the sound of rustling plastic, then a hesitant question. \"Just talk into it?\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"Ok, cool.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"Uh.\" The boy's voice trailed off, a sigh escaping his lips. \"Ok, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"How I feel about the War in Iraq...\"\n\nHe scratched at the stubble on his jaw, a long, weary sigh escaping him.  \"Let me see... um...\" \n\nHe swallowed, the words catching in his throat like grit. \"At this point, it feels pointless. I mean, it ain't even a real war, not officially. Just a... payback thing. Like we figured out who did it – those folks who hit us on nine-eleven.\"\n\nHe looked out, his gaze lost in the gray distance.  \"I don't follow it much, the War in Iraq.  Don't know the details.  But it feels like we're hanging on, trying to build some kind of democracy there. Make it another... American thing.\"  \n\nHe spat on the ground, a bitter taste in his mouth. \"And maybe grab some oil while we're at it. But it ain't right, all this anger, all this fighting. It ain't solving anything.\"\n\nHe looked down at his hands, calloused and worn. \"And building democracy... that takes time, a whole lot of time.  You can't just force it. And if we just walk away, well...\"  \n\nHe shook his head, the words catching in his throat again. \"They'll be mad, rightfully so. We'll have messed things up, left them to clean up the mess. It's a damned catch-22.\" \n\nHis voice dropped to a whisper. \"This whole thing... it's a damn hard one.\"",
            "The preacher's words, they hung in the air like the smoke from a dying fire.  Something ain't right.  Something ain't right about this whole damn business. It's a house of worship, a house of God, and the law got no business poking its nose in. That's what the old book says, right there. Separation of church and state. Plain as day.  They're tryin' to force their will on folks, their own brand of righteousness, and that's not the way of things. \n\nIt ain't about what some folks in Boston or up in them fancy cities think. It's about what's in the heart. What's in the soul. And that ain't for the government to decide. It's for the good Lord to judge.  This whole amendment business, it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.  They say it's about protecting the people, but it's about  control. It's about silencing dissent.\n\nThe government, they ain't got no right to tell the churches what to do.  They ain't got no right to tell us what to believe.  It's a slippery slope, this whole thing. Where does it end? What's next, they tellin' us what to eat? What to wear? Who to love?\n\nThis here's America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. And we ain't gonna stand for this kind of tyranny.",
            "The air hung thick with ash, a curtain drawn over the land. A silence hung too, heavier than the dust, broken only by the rasp of the wind through the skeletal trees. He tasted it on his tongue, the grit of the dead world.  The war, they'd called it. A righteousness wrapped in lies, a whispered promise of swift justice. But it was a slow burn, this thing they'd wrought. A festering wound on the face of the earth.\n\nHe couldn't speak its name. The word tasted like copper and bile in his mouth.  It was a dog's growl, a child's whimper, a strangled cry. It was the echo of boots on ash, the ghosts of laughter choked by smoke.\n\nThey had said it was about freedom, about bringing democracy to a land of shadows. But freedom tasted like dust, and democracy was a fragile bloom in this barren landscape.  It was a lie told over and over, a story spun to mask the hunger in the hearts of men.\n\nThey had promised a quick victory, a swift ending to the nightmare. But victory tasted like ashes, like the bitter tang of grief. And the nightmare stretched on, a tapestry woven with blood and bone.\n\nHe looked at the boy, his face creased with weariness, eyes haunted by the emptiness of the world. They were both ghosts, they were both adrift in this wasteland.  The boy, he was the only thing that kept him tethered to the remnants of humanity. The only reason to keep walking, to keep searching for a flicker of hope in the endless gray.\n\nHe thought of the lakes he used to fish in, the woods where he used to hunt, the laughter of children playing in the streets. \n\nThey were gone now, swallowed by the dust and the silence.  \n\nHe would fight for the boy, he would fight for the memory of what they had lost. He would fight until his last breath. \n\nBut even in his heart, a cold fear took root.\n\nWhat if there was nothing left to fight for?  What if the world had already been consumed by the ashes?",
            "He spoke slow, his words catching like windblown leaves in the dry brush.  \"It's somethin' personal, this. Always been. A matter of the heart, like a vein runnin' wrong.  A twist in the blood.\" He paused, thumbing a worn spot on his worn sleeve.  \"Can't legislate that, can you? Can't make a man's soul sing to another man's soul if it ain't meant to be. It's deeper than that, see?  The books, the preachers, they say it's a choice.  But I ask you, can you choose the sun to rise in the east? Can you choose the way the wind whispers through the pines?\"\n\nHe spat a wad of tobacco juice into the dust. \"It's wrong, plain wrong, to deny a man the right to love, to build a life with another.  Just because some folks can't understand it, shouldn't mean they get to take it away.\"\n\nHis voice, low and rumbling, echoed in the vast emptiness around them. \"I see it in my neighborhood.  Folks livin' their lives, just like any other. Walkin' their dogs, tendin' their gardens, shapin' their little worlds.  Why should they be less?  Why should they have to hide?\"\n\nHe shook his head, the motion slow and weary. \"It ain't about God, not really. It's about fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of what they don't understand.  It's a sickness, that fear. It eats away at the heart, leaves nothin' but bitterness in its wake.\"  \n\n\nHe sighed, the sound a gust of wind through dry bones.  \"Let 'em try to legislate love, I say. Let 'em try to box it in, to control it. It'll just keep growin',  stronger, wilder.  Love always finds a way.\"",
            "The boy spoke, voice thin as a wire in the dead air.  \"You put somethin' on the internet, it's out there. Open road. Can't take it back.\"\n\nThe words hung, heavy as ash, in the silence.  A truth the boy knew in his bones, a truth etched in the dust and bone of the ravaged world. \"It's a public square,\" he went on, \"a gossip well that never runs dry. Say somethin' loud enough, someone's gonna hear.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy's question, the one that had followed them like a shadow across the scorched plains. \"What if you talk 'bout... blowin' things up?\" he'd asked. \"What if you talk 'bout shootin'?\"\n\nA grim smile tugged at the man's lips. \"Someone's gonna take notice.  And they'll act. Gotta act. Can't just leave it hangin' like a crows nest in the wind.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, small skull tilted, eyes dark as the empty sky. \"Like the school,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Like the school,\" the man agreed.\n\nHe remembered the whisperings, the fear that had crawled through the halls like a starved dog.  The boy's words, his innocence, a flickering candle in the encroaching dark.  \"It could be a joke,\" the man had said then. \"Some kid messin' around.\"\n\nBut the words lingered, a poison seed planted in fertile ground.  Someone heard. Someone saw.  And the world shifted, tilted on its axis.\n\n\"They gotta check,\" the man said now, voice gravelly from dust and despair. \"Can't ignore it.  Can't let it fester.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, eyes filled with a weariness beyond years. \"But,\" he added, \"you gotta be careful what you plant.\"\n\nThe boy looked down, fiddling with a loose thread on his ragged shirt. \"Can't control what people think,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"No,\" the man agreed. \"But you can control your words.  They're the seeds you sow.\"\n\nThe wind howled through the skeletal trees, a mournful lament for a world gone silent.  The sun, a pale ghost in the sky, offered no warmth, no hope.\n\nOnly the ashes.",
            "The war. It stretched on like a bad dream, a wound that wouldn't close.  At first, the purpose felt right, clear. To bring democracy to a land choked by iron. But somewhere along the way, the light had dimmed. Now it felt like a hunger, a need to prove something, to show the world the weight of our power.  \n\nThe motives, even then, felt muddy. Whispers of old scores, of debts owed and favors sought, lingered like smoke. The son of a man who'd tangled with that Saddam Hussein before, a puppet master pulling strings from afar.  \n\nDemocracy, a fine ideal. But the thirst for it had gone sour, the taste of it turned bitter. It seemed we'd made our point in the first blood-soaked months. The world had seen. Heard.  But the hammering went on. Years bled into years, the years bleeding into the young men whose lives were spilled on that arid ground. \n\nWe were fighting to win, to prove something, though what that something was, nobody seemed to say any more.  It felt like a bad habit, a sickness we couldn't shake.\n\nBillions spent, for what?  While our own cities crumbled, our own people starved. Poverty gnawed at the edges of our society, education withered, and healthcare became a luxury.\n\nWe were bleeding ourselves dry for a cause that had lost its way, a phantom in the desert wind.  It was time to stop. Time to let the desert sand claim its own. Time to turn our backs on the ghosts of tyrants and bring our sons home.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of ash and dust. He spoke, voice low, almost a rasp.  \"It's a question, ain't it? About the line we walk. What's seen, what's hidden.\" He paused, fingers tracing a worn groove in the table, the plastic worn smooth by time and weather. \"They say the world's wide open, everything laid out for the taking on them there computers. But is it truly open? Or is it just another kind of cage?\" He looked up, eyes shadowed, a storm gathering behind them.  \"You put something out there, even a word, a picture, and it ain't yours anymore, is it?\" \n\nHe shook his head slowly, letting the question hang in the air. \"This boy, this boy nearly slipped through the cracks. Someone saw, someone cared. Maybe that's the world we're cursed with now, a world where every shadow's watched, every breath a whisper in the wind. We think we're free, but the truth is, we're all just players in a vast, unending game. And the rules, well, they're changing faster than the desert wind.\"\n\nHe fell silent, staring into the dying embers of the fire. \"Is it right? Is it wrong? These questions, they gnaw at you, don't they? But the answers, they're buried deep, maybe deeper than we can find them.\"",
            "The air hung thick, a silence choked by dust and ash. Words, like brittle leaves, skittered across the barren landscape of his mind.  He knew what he had to say, what the world needed to hear. But the words, they wouldn't come easy. Not clean, not sharp.  They tangled, snagged on the barbs of doubt and the ghosts of a war fought in shadows long gone.\n\n\"It's a lie,\" he rasped, the sound catching in his throat like gravel. \"A goddamn lie.\"  \n\nHe felt a kinship with the ghosts of those who had come before, those who had fought and died on battlefields stripped bare, their voices swallowed by the endless wind. \"They say it was for freedom,\" he continued, his voice a low growl, \"for democracy. But freedom's a brittle thing, a whisper lost in the canyons of a dying land.\"\n\nHe traced the lines of his palm, the map of a life etched in hardship and sorrow. \"They don't understand,\" he muttered, his gaze fixed on the unforgiving horizon. \"They sit in their ivory towers, blind to the blood spilled in the name of their ambitions.\"\n\nThe statistics, they meant nothing. The numbers, cold and clinical, couldn't capture the weight of loss, the echoes of screams swallowed by the desert night. \n\n\"Eighty percent, they say,\" he croaked, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. \"Eighty percent of the world knows it was a mistake. But what good are numbers when faced with the desolate truth?\"\n\nHe looked up, his eyes searching the endless expanse, a plea for understanding lost in the swirling dust. \"There's no victory in this land,\" he whispered, his voice ragged with despair. \"Only the bitter taste of ash and the ghosts of broken promises.\"",
            "The air hung thick with it, this thing they called equality. A lie whispered in boardrooms, a ghost in the halls of power.  Women, they said, had come a long way. But the glass ceiling remained, a shimmering, unforgiving surface.  A man looking down might mistake it for clear sky, but those who climbed knew the truth. The weight of history pressed down, the echoes of an old world where a woman's place was in the home, her ambition stifled by societal expectations. \n\nIt wasn't just women, though. The fields of work, they had their own unforgiving borders.  A man at home with his children,  a shade of blue in a world of grays, faced scorn. \"The breadwinner,\" they called him, a title that stung like a branding iron.  \n\nAnd fashion, that world of spun silk and fleeting trends, it held its own prejudices. A man who dared to tread its paths, to speak of color and cut, was met with suspicion.  His words, twisted into doubts, his intentions questioned. \"A man in fashion?\" they'd sneer, \"Does he even know what women want?\"\n\nIt was a slow rot, this prejudice, ingrained in the very marrow of society.  But change, it came in whispers, in the quiet acts of defiance. A woman stepping into a boardroom, a man choosing to nurture instead of provide.  Slowly, the lines blurred, the borders softened. It was a long road, but every step counted.  One day, maybe, the world would see the truth: that strength came in all forms, that talent knew no gender, and that beauty resided not in conformity, but in the courage to be oneself.",
            "The talk was of laws, not of God. Decriminalization, they called it. A word like ash, settling on the tongue.  Not criminal, not anymore. More like a speeding ticket, a fine, a slap on the wrist. He'd heard the talk, the arguments: the cost of hauling men in, the weight of the courts, the drain on the treasury. Money, always money. A new kind of  poverty, a hunger for it.  But something else lingered beneath the talk, a shadow in the corners of the room. The fear, the whispers about jobs, about futures, about the stain that wouldn't wash. \n\nHe'd seen the way they looked at those marks, the way they clung to the old ways. Denver, they said, a haven. A place where the air was thin and the minds were open. Maybe. But even there, the smoke from the devil's herb hung heavy. A constant reminder of the things that lurked beneath the surface, the things that couldn't be spoken aloud. They decriminalized it, they said, but it still had teeth. Still held the power to bite. \n\nHe thought of his uncle, sitting in the old rowboat, the lake a mirror to the sky.  The silence between them, thick as the humid air.  The way his uncle watched the water, his eyes like old marbles, reflecting a world long gone.   They'd been silent, those days.  But he knew his uncle thought about it, about the things that were  unspeakable. The things that lingered in the corners of memory, the things that made the heart ache.",
            "The man sat, his gaze fixed on the dust motes dancing in the thin light filtering through the cracked windowpane. He shifted in his worn chair, the wood creaking a low protest. \"Yes,\" he said finally, his voice rough as gravel. \"Tradition. It's a weight, a thing you carry, a cloak that both warms and binds.\" He paused, his eyes drifting to the faded crucifix hanging crookedly on the wall. \"They say it's good, to be rooted. But the roots, they can strangle you too. They can keep you from seeing the world changing.\" \n\nHe sighed, the sound rasping in his chest. \"They cling to it, the old ways. The church, the rituals, the dogma. It's a fortress against the darkness, they say. But sometimes,\" he added, his voice dropping to a whisper, \"the darkness comes from within.\"\n\nHe looked up, his gaze lingering on the crucifix. \"They want you perfect, these people of the cloth. They want you to fold yourself into their mold, to fit the pattern. But there are cracks in the mold, fissures where the light breaks through. Where doubt takes root. And sometimes,\" he said, his voice hardening, \"those cracks are all that keep you sane.\"\n\n\nHe remembered his father, his face weathered and worn, his eyes filled with a quiet despair. He remembered the whispers in the shadows, the unspoken judgments. \"My father,\" he said, his voice barely audible, \"he was different. He didn't fit. They shunned him, they cast him out. And for what? For loving another, for daring to choose his own path?\"\n\nHe stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. \"It's hypocrisy, that's what it is. They preach love, but they build walls of exclusion. They speak of forgiveness, but they offer only judgment.\" He shook his head, his eyes filled with a weary anger. \"The world is changing, but they cling to the past. They're blind to the truth.\"\n\nHe walked to the window, his shadow stretching long and thin across the floor. \"The only truth,\" he said, his voice hollow, \"is in the heart. In the choices you make, the paths you choose. And sometimes, the hardest choice is to break free from the chains of tradition, to walk your own way, even if it leads you into the darkness.\"",
            "The line, it blurs. Church and state, a frayed seam in the fabric of this country. Two sides, locked in a dance, one foot on the altar, the other on the courthouse steps. Marriage, they say. A sacrament, they whisper.  A contract, they decree. But what's a contract but a promise, and what's a promise but a faith, a hope, a fragile thing in the face of this hard world?\n\nIt's a question that gnaws, a bone picked clean, leaving only the marrow of doubt.  Two bodies, bound. Two souls, entangled. The government, a cold judge, should it weigh in? Define this thing they call love, this thing that bleeds and births and breaks?\n\nBaptism, they say. A sacrament. But what of the unseen bonds, the ties that hold families together, the whispers of kinship that echo through generations? Should these be measured, weighed, cataloged by the state?  \n\nCivil unions, they say. A compromise. But is a contract a cradle, a haven?  Or just a cage, gilded but still a cage?  \n\nWhat of the love that cannot be contained, that spills over the edges of definition? It's a wildfire, a storm surge, a force beyond the grasp of law.  \n\nLet the states decide, some say. But what of the unity, the fabric of this nation, frayed by discord?  \n\nA constitutional amendment, a wall built to keep out the light. A monument to fear, not faith.  The constitution, it is a beacon, a promise of liberty, not a weapon to be wielded against the tender shoots of love.\n\nAmend it for a cause? For a fear? No.  Love isn't a battle to be fought, a cause to be won. It's a song, a whisper, a quiet truth that echoes in the chambers of the heart.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and ash.  The man spoke low, his words rasping like stones in a dry creek bed. \"Raised right, I was. Church every Sunday. Taught to believe. But these things, these… choices… they're a tangled thing, ain't they? Like a knot tied in a rope that won't come undone.\" \n\nHe shifted, the weight of the world settling on his shoulders. \"Friends I got, good friends, different.  I don't rightly say I understand it, this… this way of life. But they're my brothers, my kin.  Shouldn't be a sin, should it?  If two souls find peace in each other,  what right have we to judge?\"\n\nHis gaze drifted to the road ahead, a ribbon of dust winding through the desolate landscape. \"Each state, that's where it should be decided.  Let the people speak. Let them choose their own path, their own reckoning.  A man can't force his beliefs on another, no more than he can force the sun to rise in the west.\"\n\nHe spat a wad of tobacco into the dust. \"That man in Washington, he thinks he knows best, don't he?  But he ain't God.  He's a man, just like the rest of us, prone to error, to doubt, to fear.  Let the states decide.  Let it be a matter of conscience, not of decree.\"  \n\nHe fell silent, his eyes fixed on the horizon, a distant smudge of gray against the dying light. \"Some things,\" he murmured, \"are better left unsaid.  Some truths are too heavy to bear.\"",
            "The words hung there, half-formed, swallowed by the bleak silence. \"Public?\" he rasped, the word a brittle shard against the ash-grey landscape. \"Yeah, public. Like a billboard in the wasteland.\" A cough tore through him, a ragged rasp in the stillness.\n\n\"People seein' it, that's the point, ain't it?\" His gaze drifted across the sun-bleached expanse, where skeletal trees clawed at the leaden sky. \"They see your soul laid bare, your thoughts like vultures circling.\"\n\nHe shifted, the worn fabric of his coat whispering against his lean frame. \"School officials, they got a right, you think? To peek into your heart, see what's festerin' inside? Just 'cause they got a badge and a uniform?\"\n\nA long silence stretched, punctuated only by the wind's mournful sigh through the shattered branches. \"Maybe it's about safety,\" he finally muttered, his voice a dry whisper. \"Maybe they're lookin' for the storm clouds gatherin', the ones that might burst into fire.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, eyes shadowed and deep. \"But what if they find the wrong kind of storm? What if they think a dark thought is a threat, a whisper of rebellion a call to arms?\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his voice dropping to a low growl. \"They say everything you put out there stays out there. A ghost echoin' through the canyons of the internet. But what if they start huntin' ghosts? What if they start fearin' the shadows?\"\n\nHe looked back at the desolate landscape, his face etched with a weary resignation. \"Maybe they ain't savin' lives. Maybe they're just buryin' them deeper.\"",
            "The war. Nine Eleven.  The air hung thick with it then. Made a man want to pour oil on the fire, see it burn clean.  That's how I felt.  But now... now the ash settles. The smoke clears.  And you see the bones. \n\nWe went in like a fever, eyes glazed, hearts pounding.  Thought we'd strike the matches, set the world right.  Didn't stop to think about the wind.  Didn't think about where the sparks would fly.  Didn't think about the tinder, dry and waiting.   \n\nThey say chaos is a ladder, but in that place it was a tangled mess of roots, choking the light. We tried to prune it, carve order from the chaos.  But the more we cut, the more it bled.\n\nThey say you can't judge a people by their worst, but sometimes... sometimes the worst is all you see.  They fight amongst themselves, like wolves starving for scraps.  And you wonder, do they even know what it means to be human?\n\nMaybe that's the real mistake.  Going in there with our own measure of humanity, expecting it to fit.  It doesn't.  Their world is a different kind of darkness.  We brought our light, but it only burned brighter in the shadows.\n\nNow, the light fades.  The war drags on, a slow bleed.  We're losing ground, losing hope.  Maybe it's time to walk away.  Let the ashes settle.  Let the wind carry the whispers of what was.\n\nBut even in the silence, the ghosts of nine Eleven linger.  They'll stay with us, a shadow on the horizon, a reminder of the cost of anger, of the price of forgetting."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, she needs to change.  That much is plain.  They talk of losing their flock, these men in their black robes, and the reason ain't hard to see. They hold fast to things, to ways of thinking older than the dust on these worn-out roads.  The world turns, but they stand rigid, their faces etched in stone.\n\nTake marriage, for instance. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, they say it ain't right. They cling to a scripture older than the hills, a book of stories told in firelight, a time when the world was young and different. And what of a woman's right to choose?  The body, a vessel, a thing to be controlled.  Birth control, a sin. Abortion, a stain. These are the things they preach, these are the things that drive folks away, like smoke from a dying fire.\n\nThis ain't new. I've heard the whispers, the voices murmuring in the shadows. They say the Church stands on a foundation cracked and crumbling. The old ways no longer hold sway.  The wind of change is blowing, and the Church, she stands against it, her roots dug deep in the ground, blind to the storm gathering on the horizon.\n\n\nThey say the Church is against abortion.  A woman's choice, they say, is a sin.  But what of the woman, what of her burden, her pain?  Is she not a soul, a being worthy of compassion?\n\nAnd the gays, the ones who love each other, who seek only to share their lives in the light of day. They are deemed an abomination, a stain on the fabric of God's creation.  They are cast out, ostracized, their love branded a sin.\n\nI don't see it that way.  I see two souls, bound together by a love as real and true as any other.  Why should they be denied the simple right to happiness? \n\nThey say priests should be celibate, devoted solely to God.  But what of the man who yearns for companionship, for the warmth of another soul?  Does God not wish for his children to find joy and fulfillment in this life, in love and connection? \n\nThis ain't a matter of doctrine or scripture.  It's a matter of the heart, of compassion, of understanding.  The Church needs to open her eyes, to see the world as it is, not as it was.   The world is changing, and the Church, if she wants to survive, must change with it.",
            "The boy sat across from him, eyes wide and fixed. \"Do you think,\" he said, voice small, \"that some things are just the way they are?\" \n\nThe man stared into the distance, his gaze fixed on the dull gray horizon. Dust motes danced in the sliver of light that pierced the gloom. \"Maybe,\" he said, his voice rough and low. \"Maybe some things are just the way they are.\"\n\n\"Like...\" the boy hesitated, searching for the right words. \"Like...love?\"\n\nThe man turned his head slowly, a shadow of a smile flickering across his face. \"Love,\" he echoed, the word hanging heavy in the silence. \"Love is a hard thing to pin down.\"  He gestured vaguely towards the vast emptiness that stretched before them. \"This world,\" he said, \"it's full of things that can't be explained.\"\n\nThe boy considered this for a long moment, chewing on the end of a stray thread on his worn blanket. \"So it's okay,\" he said finally, \"if people love people, even if it's not...the way they're supposed to?\"\n\nThe man looked at him then, his eyes filled with a strange tenderness. \"Maybe,\" he repeated, his voice softer now. \"Maybe it's just okay.\"",
            "The boy looked up at the man, his eyes pale and watchful in the dust-choked light. \"Should we?\" he asked, voice thin.\n\n\"Should we what?\" the man said, his gaze fixed on the road stretching out before them, a ribbon of gray against the ashen landscape.\n\n\"Should we like... marry?\"\n\nThe man shifted the weight of the knapsack on his shoulder, the worn canvas creaking. \"Marry? Why?\"\n\n\"Just like... everyone else.\"\n\n\"Everyone else,\" the man echoed, the words tasting bitter on his tongue. \"They ain't got nothin' to teach us, son. Not anymore.\" \n\nThe boy frowned. \"But it means... somethin', don't it?\" He looked around at the desolate landscape, the skeletal trees clawing at the gray sky. \"Something good.\"\n\nThe man said nothing for a long time, just stared at the road. Then he looked down at the boy, his face lined and weathered like a piece of old leather. \"This ain't a world for good things, son,\" he said. \"Not anymore. This world's for survival.\"\n\n\"But... what if it could be different?\" the boy persisted, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nThe man touched the boy's shoulder gently, his hand calloused and rough. \"We'll see,\" he said, his voice low and uncertain. \"We'll see.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence stretching between them like a shroud. The wind whispered through the ash-covered trees, carrying with it the faint scent of something dying.",
            "The air hung thick with the smell of sickness and dust. The pharmacy, a fluorescent-lit cage, hummed with a low, constant thrum. He glanced at the vials lining the shelves, the rows of pills, the brightly colored labels.  \"Just because something is outlawed,\" he said, his voice rasping, \"doesn't mean it has no use.\" He spoke slowly, picking his words carefully. \"There's a kind of shadow cast on it, a fear. A lie.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy, pale and thin, coughing in the next room. A cough that clawed at his insides, a cough that the pills couldn't touch. He thought of the whispers in the hallways, the hushed tones, the judging eyes. They called it a devil's weed, a poison, a gateway. But he knew better. He'd seen the way it could ease the pain, the way it could bring a moment of peace.\n\n\"They lock it away,\" he continued, \"but it grows wild, untamed. It's there in the alleys, in the shadows, in the minds of those who dare to seek it.\"\n\nHe saw the boy's face, the fear in his eyes, the desperation. He knew what it was to be trapped, to be sick, to be alone. He knew the hunger for relief, the yearning for a sliver of solace. And he knew that sometimes, the only solace could be found in the darkness. \n\n\"It's not a monster,\" he whispered, his voice barely audible above the hum of the fluorescent lights. \"It's a whisper, a promise. A possibility.\"\n\nHe looked back at the shelves, at the rows of pills, at the faces of those he served. And he wondered, how many more would they condemn before they learned the truth?",
            "The church, it's changed. Softened. Not the hard-edged institution it used to be. I remember, back when I was a child, Sunday was a ritual.  Matching dress, shoes, purse – all of it pressed and prim.  Every Sunday, same parade. Private school, friends all there, faces scrubbed clean.  But now, they've got this \"teen mass\" - thirty minutes, tops. People come in stained shorts, dripping sand from the beach.  Families burst in late, like they're doing the church a favor by showing up at all. Even the morning masses, where I used to stand stiff and proper in my best clothes, now folks are in jeans and khakis. Khakis ain't bad, but it's...casual. \n\nThat's the thing, I guess. The church is more casual now.  \n\nI don't know if that's good or bad.  About those priests, those accusations...I don't think it matters if they were married or not. Some men, they're just broken.  It ain't about the vows, it's the darkness inside. Like in those old stories, the ones with the monsters lurking in the woods.  They're already there.  Marriage wouldn't change that.  \n\nMaybe it's a different kind of faith they need, one where they can find peace without the church's walls.",
            "The dust rose like a wraith. September, they called it. But the air held the chill of some perpetual November.  He remembered, though, the day the towers fell. A day the sky itself seemed to bleed. And the lies that flowed from the mouths of men in suits, the promises whispered like prayers. They spoke of Bin Laden, of weapons, of a righteous war. But the blood tasted of ash in his mouth, the kind that choked the light from the world.\n\nHe thought of Powell, his voice a hollow echo in that grand hall, laying out the evidence, the weight of the world on his shoulders. A man who, even then, knew the truth was a flickering candle in a storm.  A man forced to be a shepherd to lies.\n\nThe word \"malfeasance\" hung in the air, a brittle thing. An impeachable offense, they called it.  But what good are words when they are swallowed by the dust? When power is a hungry beast, and truth a forgotten prayer?\n\nThe younger Bush, he saw it in his eyes. A thirst, a hunger for something more than justice. A hunger for vengeance, for dominion, for oil-stained promises.  \n\nHe thought of the lake, his father’s weathered face, the creaking of the oars cutting through the silence. A different kind of war, fought in the stillness of the water, the smell of pine needles and damp earth. A war where the enemy was not a man, but a shadow, a memory.\n\nNow, the air tasted of smoke and despair. The whispers of the wind carried the echoes of gunfire, the cries of children lost in the dust.  And he wondered, with a cold certainty, if this was the legacy they would leave for the world. A legacy of ash and blood, a world where the only truth was the weight of the silence.",
            "The air hung thick, a gauze of ash clinging to the tongue. The boy spoke, voice a rasp in the stillness. \"I done.\" \n\n\"Mmhmm.\" \n\nA pause, the sound of rustling plastic, then a hesitant question. \"Just talk into it?\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"Ok, cool.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"Uh.\" The boy's voice trailed off, a sigh escaping his lips. \"Ok, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"How I feel about the War in Iraq...\"\n\nHe scratched at the stubble on his jaw, a long, weary sigh escaping him.  \"Let me see... um...\" \n\nHe swallowed, the words catching in his throat like grit. \"At this point, it feels pointless. I mean, it ain't even a real war, not officially. Just a... payback thing. Like we figured out who did it – those folks who hit us on nine-eleven.\"\n\nHe looked out, his gaze lost in the gray distance.  \"I don't follow it much, the War in Iraq.  Don't know the details.  But it feels like we're hanging on, trying to build some kind of democracy there. Make it another... American thing.\"  \n\nHe spat on the ground, a bitter taste in his mouth. \"And maybe grab some oil while we're at it. But it ain't right, all this anger, all this fighting. It ain't solving anything.\"\n\nHe looked down at his hands, calloused and worn. \"And building democracy... that takes time, a whole lot of time.  You can't just force it. And if we just walk away, well...\"  \n\nHe shook his head, the words catching in his throat again. \"They'll be mad, rightfully so. We'll have messed things up, left them to clean up the mess. It's a damned catch-22.\" \n\nHis voice dropped to a whisper. \"This whole thing... it's a damn hard one.\"",
            "The preacher's words, they hung in the air like the smoke from a dying fire.  Something ain't right.  Something ain't right about this whole damn business. It's a house of worship, a house of God, and the law got no business poking its nose in. That's what the old book says, right there. Separation of church and state. Plain as day.  They're tryin' to force their will on folks, their own brand of righteousness, and that's not the way of things. \n\nIt ain't about what some folks in Boston or up in them fancy cities think. It's about what's in the heart. What's in the soul. And that ain't for the government to decide. It's for the good Lord to judge.  This whole amendment business, it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.  They say it's about protecting the people, but it's about  control. It's about silencing dissent.\n\nThe government, they ain't got no right to tell the churches what to do.  They ain't got no right to tell us what to believe.  It's a slippery slope, this whole thing. Where does it end? What's next, they tellin' us what to eat? What to wear? Who to love?\n\nThis here's America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. And we ain't gonna stand for this kind of tyranny.",
            "The air hung thick with ash, a curtain drawn over the land. A silence hung too, heavier than the dust, broken only by the rasp of the wind through the skeletal trees. He tasted it on his tongue, the grit of the dead world.  The war, they'd called it. A righteousness wrapped in lies, a whispered promise of swift justice. But it was a slow burn, this thing they'd wrought. A festering wound on the face of the earth.\n\nHe couldn't speak its name. The word tasted like copper and bile in his mouth.  It was a dog's growl, a child's whimper, a strangled cry. It was the echo of boots on ash, the ghosts of laughter choked by smoke.\n\nThey had said it was about freedom, about bringing democracy to a land of shadows. But freedom tasted like dust, and democracy was a fragile bloom in this barren landscape.  It was a lie told over and over, a story spun to mask the hunger in the hearts of men.\n\nThey had promised a quick victory, a swift ending to the nightmare. But victory tasted like ashes, like the bitter tang of grief. And the nightmare stretched on, a tapestry woven with blood and bone.\n\nHe looked at the boy, his face creased with weariness, eyes haunted by the emptiness of the world. They were both ghosts, they were both adrift in this wasteland.  The boy, he was the only thing that kept him tethered to the remnants of humanity. The only reason to keep walking, to keep searching for a flicker of hope in the endless gray.\n\nHe thought of the lakes he used to fish in, the woods where he used to hunt, the laughter of children playing in the streets. \n\nThey were gone now, swallowed by the dust and the silence.  \n\nHe would fight for the boy, he would fight for the memory of what they had lost. He would fight until his last breath. \n\nBut even in his heart, a cold fear took root.\n\nWhat if there was nothing left to fight for?  What if the world had already been consumed by the ashes?",
            "He spoke slow, his words catching like windblown leaves in the dry brush.  \"It's somethin' personal, this. Always been. A matter of the heart, like a vein runnin' wrong.  A twist in the blood.\" He paused, thumbing a worn spot on his worn sleeve.  \"Can't legislate that, can you? Can't make a man's soul sing to another man's soul if it ain't meant to be. It's deeper than that, see?  The books, the preachers, they say it's a choice.  But I ask you, can you choose the sun to rise in the east? Can you choose the way the wind whispers through the pines?\"\n\nHe spat a wad of tobacco juice into the dust. \"It's wrong, plain wrong, to deny a man the right to love, to build a life with another.  Just because some folks can't understand it, shouldn't mean they get to take it away.\"\n\nHis voice, low and rumbling, echoed in the vast emptiness around them. \"I see it in my neighborhood.  Folks livin' their lives, just like any other. Walkin' their dogs, tendin' their gardens, shapin' their little worlds.  Why should they be less?  Why should they have to hide?\"\n\nHe shook his head, the motion slow and weary. \"It ain't about God, not really. It's about fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of what they don't understand.  It's a sickness, that fear. It eats away at the heart, leaves nothin' but bitterness in its wake.\"  \n\n\nHe sighed, the sound a gust of wind through dry bones.  \"Let 'em try to legislate love, I say. Let 'em try to box it in, to control it. It'll just keep growin',  stronger, wilder.  Love always finds a way.\"",
            "The boy spoke, voice thin as a wire in the dead air.  \"You put somethin' on the internet, it's out there. Open road. Can't take it back.\"\n\nThe words hung, heavy as ash, in the silence.  A truth the boy knew in his bones, a truth etched in the dust and bone of the ravaged world. \"It's a public square,\" he went on, \"a gossip well that never runs dry. Say somethin' loud enough, someone's gonna hear.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy's question, the one that had followed them like a shadow across the scorched plains. \"What if you talk 'bout... blowin' things up?\" he'd asked. \"What if you talk 'bout shootin'?\"\n\nA grim smile tugged at the man's lips. \"Someone's gonna take notice.  And they'll act. Gotta act. Can't just leave it hangin' like a crows nest in the wind.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, small skull tilted, eyes dark as the empty sky. \"Like the school,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Like the school,\" the man agreed.\n\nHe remembered the whisperings, the fear that had crawled through the halls like a starved dog.  The boy's words, his innocence, a flickering candle in the encroaching dark.  \"It could be a joke,\" the man had said then. \"Some kid messin' around.\"\n\nBut the words lingered, a poison seed planted in fertile ground.  Someone heard. Someone saw.  And the world shifted, tilted on its axis.\n\n\"They gotta check,\" the man said now, voice gravelly from dust and despair. \"Can't ignore it.  Can't let it fester.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, eyes filled with a weariness beyond years. \"But,\" he added, \"you gotta be careful what you plant.\"\n\nThe boy looked down, fiddling with a loose thread on his ragged shirt. \"Can't control what people think,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"No,\" the man agreed. \"But you can control your words.  They're the seeds you sow.\"\n\nThe wind howled through the skeletal trees, a mournful lament for a world gone silent.  The sun, a pale ghost in the sky, offered no warmth, no hope.\n\nOnly the ashes.",
            "The war. It stretched on like a bad dream, a wound that wouldn't close.  At first, the purpose felt right, clear. To bring democracy to a land choked by iron. But somewhere along the way, the light had dimmed. Now it felt like a hunger, a need to prove something, to show the world the weight of our power.  \n\nThe motives, even then, felt muddy. Whispers of old scores, of debts owed and favors sought, lingered like smoke. The son of a man who'd tangled with that Saddam Hussein before, a puppet master pulling strings from afar.  \n\nDemocracy, a fine ideal. But the thirst for it had gone sour, the taste of it turned bitter. It seemed we'd made our point in the first blood-soaked months. The world had seen. Heard.  But the hammering went on. Years bled into years, the years bleeding into the young men whose lives were spilled on that arid ground. \n\nWe were fighting to win, to prove something, though what that something was, nobody seemed to say any more.  It felt like a bad habit, a sickness we couldn't shake.\n\nBillions spent, for what?  While our own cities crumbled, our own people starved. Poverty gnawed at the edges of our society, education withered, and healthcare became a luxury.\n\nWe were bleeding ourselves dry for a cause that had lost its way, a phantom in the desert wind.  It was time to stop. Time to let the desert sand claim its own. Time to turn our backs on the ghosts of tyrants and bring our sons home.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of ash and dust. He spoke, voice low, almost a rasp.  \"It's a question, ain't it? About the line we walk. What's seen, what's hidden.\" He paused, fingers tracing a worn groove in the table, the plastic worn smooth by time and weather. \"They say the world's wide open, everything laid out for the taking on them there computers. But is it truly open? Or is it just another kind of cage?\" He looked up, eyes shadowed, a storm gathering behind them.  \"You put something out there, even a word, a picture, and it ain't yours anymore, is it?\" \n\nHe shook his head slowly, letting the question hang in the air. \"This boy, this boy nearly slipped through the cracks. Someone saw, someone cared. Maybe that's the world we're cursed with now, a world where every shadow's watched, every breath a whisper in the wind. We think we're free, but the truth is, we're all just players in a vast, unending game. And the rules, well, they're changing faster than the desert wind.\"\n\nHe fell silent, staring into the dying embers of the fire. \"Is it right? Is it wrong? These questions, they gnaw at you, don't they? But the answers, they're buried deep, maybe deeper than we can find them.\"",
            "The air hung thick, a silence choked by dust and ash. Words, like brittle leaves, skittered across the barren landscape of his mind.  He knew what he had to say, what the world needed to hear. But the words, they wouldn't come easy. Not clean, not sharp.  They tangled, snagged on the barbs of doubt and the ghosts of a war fought in shadows long gone.\n\n\"It's a lie,\" he rasped, the sound catching in his throat like gravel. \"A goddamn lie.\"  \n\nHe felt a kinship with the ghosts of those who had come before, those who had fought and died on battlefields stripped bare, their voices swallowed by the endless wind. \"They say it was for freedom,\" he continued, his voice a low growl, \"for democracy. But freedom's a brittle thing, a whisper lost in the canyons of a dying land.\"\n\nHe traced the lines of his palm, the map of a life etched in hardship and sorrow. \"They don't understand,\" he muttered, his gaze fixed on the unforgiving horizon. \"They sit in their ivory towers, blind to the blood spilled in the name of their ambitions.\"\n\nThe statistics, they meant nothing. The numbers, cold and clinical, couldn't capture the weight of loss, the echoes of screams swallowed by the desert night. \n\n\"Eighty percent, they say,\" he croaked, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. \"Eighty percent of the world knows it was a mistake. But what good are numbers when faced with the desolate truth?\"\n\nHe looked up, his eyes searching the endless expanse, a plea for understanding lost in the swirling dust. \"There's no victory in this land,\" he whispered, his voice ragged with despair. \"Only the bitter taste of ash and the ghosts of broken promises.\"",
            "The air hung thick with it, this thing they called equality. A lie whispered in boardrooms, a ghost in the halls of power.  Women, they said, had come a long way. But the glass ceiling remained, a shimmering, unforgiving surface.  A man looking down might mistake it for clear sky, but those who climbed knew the truth. The weight of history pressed down, the echoes of an old world where a woman's place was in the home, her ambition stifled by societal expectations. \n\nIt wasn't just women, though. The fields of work, they had their own unforgiving borders.  A man at home with his children,  a shade of blue in a world of grays, faced scorn. \"The breadwinner,\" they called him, a title that stung like a branding iron.  \n\nAnd fashion, that world of spun silk and fleeting trends, it held its own prejudices. A man who dared to tread its paths, to speak of color and cut, was met with suspicion.  His words, twisted into doubts, his intentions questioned. \"A man in fashion?\" they'd sneer, \"Does he even know what women want?\"\n\nIt was a slow rot, this prejudice, ingrained in the very marrow of society.  But change, it came in whispers, in the quiet acts of defiance. A woman stepping into a boardroom, a man choosing to nurture instead of provide.  Slowly, the lines blurred, the borders softened. It was a long road, but every step counted.  One day, maybe, the world would see the truth: that strength came in all forms, that talent knew no gender, and that beauty resided not in conformity, but in the courage to be oneself.",
            "The talk was of laws, not of God. Decriminalization, they called it. A word like ash, settling on the tongue.  Not criminal, not anymore. More like a speeding ticket, a fine, a slap on the wrist. He'd heard the talk, the arguments: the cost of hauling men in, the weight of the courts, the drain on the treasury. Money, always money. A new kind of  poverty, a hunger for it.  But something else lingered beneath the talk, a shadow in the corners of the room. The fear, the whispers about jobs, about futures, about the stain that wouldn't wash. \n\nHe'd seen the way they looked at those marks, the way they clung to the old ways. Denver, they said, a haven. A place where the air was thin and the minds were open. Maybe. But even there, the smoke from the devil's herb hung heavy. A constant reminder of the things that lurked beneath the surface, the things that couldn't be spoken aloud. They decriminalized it, they said, but it still had teeth. Still held the power to bite. \n\nHe thought of his uncle, sitting in the old rowboat, the lake a mirror to the sky.  The silence between them, thick as the humid air.  The way his uncle watched the water, his eyes like old marbles, reflecting a world long gone.   They'd been silent, those days.  But he knew his uncle thought about it, about the things that were  unspeakable. The things that lingered in the corners of memory, the things that made the heart ache.",
            "The man sat, his gaze fixed on the dust motes dancing in the thin light filtering through the cracked windowpane. He shifted in his worn chair, the wood creaking a low protest. \"Yes,\" he said finally, his voice rough as gravel. \"Tradition. It's a weight, a thing you carry, a cloak that both warms and binds.\" He paused, his eyes drifting to the faded crucifix hanging crookedly on the wall. \"They say it's good, to be rooted. But the roots, they can strangle you too. They can keep you from seeing the world changing.\" \n\nHe sighed, the sound rasping in his chest. \"They cling to it, the old ways. The church, the rituals, the dogma. It's a fortress against the darkness, they say. But sometimes,\" he added, his voice dropping to a whisper, \"the darkness comes from within.\"\n\nHe looked up, his gaze lingering on the crucifix. \"They want you perfect, these people of the cloth. They want you to fold yourself into their mold, to fit the pattern. But there are cracks in the mold, fissures where the light breaks through. Where doubt takes root. And sometimes,\" he said, his voice hardening, \"those cracks are all that keep you sane.\"\n\n\nHe remembered his father, his face weathered and worn, his eyes filled with a quiet despair. He remembered the whispers in the shadows, the unspoken judgments. \"My father,\" he said, his voice barely audible, \"he was different. He didn't fit. They shunned him, they cast him out. And for what? For loving another, for daring to choose his own path?\"\n\nHe stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. \"It's hypocrisy, that's what it is. They preach love, but they build walls of exclusion. They speak of forgiveness, but they offer only judgment.\" He shook his head, his eyes filled with a weary anger. \"The world is changing, but they cling to the past. They're blind to the truth.\"\n\nHe walked to the window, his shadow stretching long and thin across the floor. \"The only truth,\" he said, his voice hollow, \"is in the heart. In the choices you make, the paths you choose. And sometimes, the hardest choice is to break free from the chains of tradition, to walk your own way, even if it leads you into the darkness.\"",
            "The line, it blurs. Church and state, a frayed seam in the fabric of this country. Two sides, locked in a dance, one foot on the altar, the other on the courthouse steps. Marriage, they say. A sacrament, they whisper.  A contract, they decree. But what's a contract but a promise, and what's a promise but a faith, a hope, a fragile thing in the face of this hard world?\n\nIt's a question that gnaws, a bone picked clean, leaving only the marrow of doubt.  Two bodies, bound. Two souls, entangled. The government, a cold judge, should it weigh in? Define this thing they call love, this thing that bleeds and births and breaks?\n\nBaptism, they say. A sacrament. But what of the unseen bonds, the ties that hold families together, the whispers of kinship that echo through generations? Should these be measured, weighed, cataloged by the state?  \n\nCivil unions, they say. A compromise. But is a contract a cradle, a haven?  Or just a cage, gilded but still a cage?  \n\nWhat of the love that cannot be contained, that spills over the edges of definition? It's a wildfire, a storm surge, a force beyond the grasp of law.  \n\nLet the states decide, some say. But what of the unity, the fabric of this nation, frayed by discord?  \n\nA constitutional amendment, a wall built to keep out the light. A monument to fear, not faith.  The constitution, it is a beacon, a promise of liberty, not a weapon to be wielded against the tender shoots of love.\n\nAmend it for a cause? For a fear? No.  Love isn't a battle to be fought, a cause to be won. It's a song, a whisper, a quiet truth that echoes in the chambers of the heart.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and ash.  The man spoke low, his words rasping like stones in a dry creek bed. \"Raised right, I was. Church every Sunday. Taught to believe. But these things, these… choices… they're a tangled thing, ain't they? Like a knot tied in a rope that won't come undone.\" \n\nHe shifted, the weight of the world settling on his shoulders. \"Friends I got, good friends, different.  I don't rightly say I understand it, this… this way of life. But they're my brothers, my kin.  Shouldn't be a sin, should it?  If two souls find peace in each other,  what right have we to judge?\"\n\nHis gaze drifted to the road ahead, a ribbon of dust winding through the desolate landscape. \"Each state, that's where it should be decided.  Let the people speak. Let them choose their own path, their own reckoning.  A man can't force his beliefs on another, no more than he can force the sun to rise in the west.\"\n\nHe spat a wad of tobacco into the dust. \"That man in Washington, he thinks he knows best, don't he?  But he ain't God.  He's a man, just like the rest of us, prone to error, to doubt, to fear.  Let the states decide.  Let it be a matter of conscience, not of decree.\"  \n\nHe fell silent, his eyes fixed on the horizon, a distant smudge of gray against the dying light. \"Some things,\" he murmured, \"are better left unsaid.  Some truths are too heavy to bear.\"",
            "The words hung there, half-formed, swallowed by the bleak silence. \"Public?\" he rasped, the word a brittle shard against the ash-grey landscape. \"Yeah, public. Like a billboard in the wasteland.\" A cough tore through him, a ragged rasp in the stillness.\n\n\"People seein' it, that's the point, ain't it?\" His gaze drifted across the sun-bleached expanse, where skeletal trees clawed at the leaden sky. \"They see your soul laid bare, your thoughts like vultures circling.\"\n\nHe shifted, the worn fabric of his coat whispering against his lean frame. \"School officials, they got a right, you think? To peek into your heart, see what's festerin' inside? Just 'cause they got a badge and a uniform?\"\n\nA long silence stretched, punctuated only by the wind's mournful sigh through the shattered branches. \"Maybe it's about safety,\" he finally muttered, his voice a dry whisper. \"Maybe they're lookin' for the storm clouds gatherin', the ones that might burst into fire.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, eyes shadowed and deep. \"But what if they find the wrong kind of storm? What if they think a dark thought is a threat, a whisper of rebellion a call to arms?\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his voice dropping to a low growl. \"They say everything you put out there stays out there. A ghost echoin' through the canyons of the internet. But what if they start huntin' ghosts? What if they start fearin' the shadows?\"\n\nHe looked back at the desolate landscape, his face etched with a weary resignation. \"Maybe they ain't savin' lives. Maybe they're just buryin' them deeper.\"",
            "The war. Nine Eleven.  The air hung thick with it then. Made a man want to pour oil on the fire, see it burn clean.  That's how I felt.  But now... now the ash settles. The smoke clears.  And you see the bones. \n\nWe went in like a fever, eyes glazed, hearts pounding.  Thought we'd strike the matches, set the world right.  Didn't stop to think about the wind.  Didn't think about where the sparks would fly.  Didn't think about the tinder, dry and waiting.   \n\nThey say chaos is a ladder, but in that place it was a tangled mess of roots, choking the light. We tried to prune it, carve order from the chaos.  But the more we cut, the more it bled.\n\nThey say you can't judge a people by their worst, but sometimes... sometimes the worst is all you see.  They fight amongst themselves, like wolves starving for scraps.  And you wonder, do they even know what it means to be human?\n\nMaybe that's the real mistake.  Going in there with our own measure of humanity, expecting it to fit.  It doesn't.  Their world is a different kind of darkness.  We brought our light, but it only burned brighter in the shadows.\n\nNow, the light fades.  The war drags on, a slow bleed.  We're losing ground, losing hope.  Maybe it's time to walk away.  Let the ashes settle.  Let the wind carry the whispers of what was.\n\nBut even in the silence, the ghosts of nine Eleven linger.  They'll stay with us, a shadow on the horizon, a reminder of the cost of anger, of the price of forgetting."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, she needs to change.  That much is plain.  They talk of losing their flock, these men in their black robes, and the reason ain't hard to see. They hold fast to things, to ways of thinking older than the dust on these worn-out roads.  The world turns, but they stand rigid, their faces etched in stone.\n\nTake marriage, for instance. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, they say it ain't right. They cling to a scripture older than the hills, a book of stories told in firelight, a time when the world was young and different. And what of a woman's right to choose?  The body, a vessel, a thing to be controlled.  Birth control, a sin. Abortion, a stain. These are the things they preach, these are the things that drive folks away, like smoke from a dying fire.\n\nThis ain't new. I've heard the whispers, the voices murmuring in the shadows. They say the Church stands on a foundation cracked and crumbling. The old ways no longer hold sway.  The wind of change is blowing, and the Church, she stands against it, her roots dug deep in the ground, blind to the storm gathering on the horizon.\n\n\nThey say the Church is against abortion.  A woman's choice, they say, is a sin.  But what of the woman, what of her burden, her pain?  Is she not a soul, a being worthy of compassion?\n\nAnd the gays, the ones who love each other, who seek only to share their lives in the light of day. They are deemed an abomination, a stain on the fabric of God's creation.  They are cast out, ostracized, their love branded a sin.\n\nI don't see it that way.  I see two souls, bound together by a love as real and true as any other.  Why should they be denied the simple right to happiness? \n\nThey say priests should be celibate, devoted solely to God.  But what of the man who yearns for companionship, for the warmth of another soul?  Does God not wish for his children to find joy and fulfillment in this life, in love and connection? \n\nThis ain't a matter of doctrine or scripture.  It's a matter of the heart, of compassion, of understanding.  The Church needs to open her eyes, to see the world as it is, not as it was.   The world is changing, and the Church, if she wants to survive, must change with it.",
            "The boy sat across from him, eyes wide and fixed. \"Do you think,\" he said, voice small, \"that some things are just the way they are?\" \n\nThe man stared into the distance, his gaze fixed on the dull gray horizon. Dust motes danced in the sliver of light that pierced the gloom. \"Maybe,\" he said, his voice rough and low. \"Maybe some things are just the way they are.\"\n\n\"Like...\" the boy hesitated, searching for the right words. \"Like...love?\"\n\nThe man turned his head slowly, a shadow of a smile flickering across his face. \"Love,\" he echoed, the word hanging heavy in the silence. \"Love is a hard thing to pin down.\"  He gestured vaguely towards the vast emptiness that stretched before them. \"This world,\" he said, \"it's full of things that can't be explained.\"\n\nThe boy considered this for a long moment, chewing on the end of a stray thread on his worn blanket. \"So it's okay,\" he said finally, \"if people love people, even if it's not...the way they're supposed to?\"\n\nThe man looked at him then, his eyes filled with a strange tenderness. \"Maybe,\" he repeated, his voice softer now. \"Maybe it's just okay.\"",
            "The boy looked up at the man, his eyes pale and watchful in the dust-choked light. \"Should we?\" he asked, voice thin.\n\n\"Should we what?\" the man said, his gaze fixed on the road stretching out before them, a ribbon of gray against the ashen landscape.\n\n\"Should we like... marry?\"\n\nThe man shifted the weight of the knapsack on his shoulder, the worn canvas creaking. \"Marry? Why?\"\n\n\"Just like... everyone else.\"\n\n\"Everyone else,\" the man echoed, the words tasting bitter on his tongue. \"They ain't got nothin' to teach us, son. Not anymore.\" \n\nThe boy frowned. \"But it means... somethin', don't it?\" He looked around at the desolate landscape, the skeletal trees clawing at the gray sky. \"Something good.\"\n\nThe man said nothing for a long time, just stared at the road. Then he looked down at the boy, his face lined and weathered like a piece of old leather. \"This ain't a world for good things, son,\" he said. \"Not anymore. This world's for survival.\"\n\n\"But... what if it could be different?\" the boy persisted, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nThe man touched the boy's shoulder gently, his hand calloused and rough. \"We'll see,\" he said, his voice low and uncertain. \"We'll see.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence stretching between them like a shroud. The wind whispered through the ash-covered trees, carrying with it the faint scent of something dying.",
            "The air hung thick with the smell of sickness and dust. The pharmacy, a fluorescent-lit cage, hummed with a low, constant thrum. He glanced at the vials lining the shelves, the rows of pills, the brightly colored labels.  \"Just because something is outlawed,\" he said, his voice rasping, \"doesn't mean it has no use.\" He spoke slowly, picking his words carefully. \"There's a kind of shadow cast on it, a fear. A lie.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy, pale and thin, coughing in the next room. A cough that clawed at his insides, a cough that the pills couldn't touch. He thought of the whispers in the hallways, the hushed tones, the judging eyes. They called it a devil's weed, a poison, a gateway. But he knew better. He'd seen the way it could ease the pain, the way it could bring a moment of peace.\n\n\"They lock it away,\" he continued, \"but it grows wild, untamed. It's there in the alleys, in the shadows, in the minds of those who dare to seek it.\"\n\nHe saw the boy's face, the fear in his eyes, the desperation. He knew what it was to be trapped, to be sick, to be alone. He knew the hunger for relief, the yearning for a sliver of solace. And he knew that sometimes, the only solace could be found in the darkness. \n\n\"It's not a monster,\" he whispered, his voice barely audible above the hum of the fluorescent lights. \"It's a whisper, a promise. A possibility.\"\n\nHe looked back at the shelves, at the rows of pills, at the faces of those he served. And he wondered, how many more would they condemn before they learned the truth?",
            "The church, it's changed. Softened. Not the hard-edged institution it used to be. I remember, back when I was a child, Sunday was a ritual.  Matching dress, shoes, purse – all of it pressed and prim.  Every Sunday, same parade. Private school, friends all there, faces scrubbed clean.  But now, they've got this \"teen mass\" - thirty minutes, tops. People come in stained shorts, dripping sand from the beach.  Families burst in late, like they're doing the church a favor by showing up at all. Even the morning masses, where I used to stand stiff and proper in my best clothes, now folks are in jeans and khakis. Khakis ain't bad, but it's...casual. \n\nThat's the thing, I guess. The church is more casual now.  \n\nI don't know if that's good or bad.  About those priests, those accusations...I don't think it matters if they were married or not. Some men, they're just broken.  It ain't about the vows, it's the darkness inside. Like in those old stories, the ones with the monsters lurking in the woods.  They're already there.  Marriage wouldn't change that.  \n\nMaybe it's a different kind of faith they need, one where they can find peace without the church's walls.",
            "The dust rose like a wraith. September, they called it. But the air held the chill of some perpetual November.  He remembered, though, the day the towers fell. A day the sky itself seemed to bleed. And the lies that flowed from the mouths of men in suits, the promises whispered like prayers. They spoke of Bin Laden, of weapons, of a righteous war. But the blood tasted of ash in his mouth, the kind that choked the light from the world.\n\nHe thought of Powell, his voice a hollow echo in that grand hall, laying out the evidence, the weight of the world on his shoulders. A man who, even then, knew the truth was a flickering candle in a storm.  A man forced to be a shepherd to lies.\n\nThe word \"malfeasance\" hung in the air, a brittle thing. An impeachable offense, they called it.  But what good are words when they are swallowed by the dust? When power is a hungry beast, and truth a forgotten prayer?\n\nThe younger Bush, he saw it in his eyes. A thirst, a hunger for something more than justice. A hunger for vengeance, for dominion, for oil-stained promises.  \n\nHe thought of the lake, his father’s weathered face, the creaking of the oars cutting through the silence. A different kind of war, fought in the stillness of the water, the smell of pine needles and damp earth. A war where the enemy was not a man, but a shadow, a memory.\n\nNow, the air tasted of smoke and despair. The whispers of the wind carried the echoes of gunfire, the cries of children lost in the dust.  And he wondered, with a cold certainty, if this was the legacy they would leave for the world. A legacy of ash and blood, a world where the only truth was the weight of the silence.",
            "The air hung thick, a gauze of ash clinging to the tongue. The boy spoke, voice a rasp in the stillness. \"I done.\" \n\n\"Mmhmm.\" \n\nA pause, the sound of rustling plastic, then a hesitant question. \"Just talk into it?\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"Ok, cool.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"Uh.\" The boy's voice trailed off, a sigh escaping his lips. \"Ok, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"How I feel about the War in Iraq...\"\n\nHe scratched at the stubble on his jaw, a long, weary sigh escaping him.  \"Let me see... um...\" \n\nHe swallowed, the words catching in his throat like grit. \"At this point, it feels pointless. I mean, it ain't even a real war, not officially. Just a... payback thing. Like we figured out who did it – those folks who hit us on nine-eleven.\"\n\nHe looked out, his gaze lost in the gray distance.  \"I don't follow it much, the War in Iraq.  Don't know the details.  But it feels like we're hanging on, trying to build some kind of democracy there. Make it another... American thing.\"  \n\nHe spat on the ground, a bitter taste in his mouth. \"And maybe grab some oil while we're at it. But it ain't right, all this anger, all this fighting. It ain't solving anything.\"\n\nHe looked down at his hands, calloused and worn. \"And building democracy... that takes time, a whole lot of time.  You can't just force it. And if we just walk away, well...\"  \n\nHe shook his head, the words catching in his throat again. \"They'll be mad, rightfully so. We'll have messed things up, left them to clean up the mess. It's a damned catch-22.\" \n\nHis voice dropped to a whisper. \"This whole thing... it's a damn hard one.\"",
            "The preacher's words, they hung in the air like the smoke from a dying fire.  Something ain't right.  Something ain't right about this whole damn business. It's a house of worship, a house of God, and the law got no business poking its nose in. That's what the old book says, right there. Separation of church and state. Plain as day.  They're tryin' to force their will on folks, their own brand of righteousness, and that's not the way of things. \n\nIt ain't about what some folks in Boston or up in them fancy cities think. It's about what's in the heart. What's in the soul. And that ain't for the government to decide. It's for the good Lord to judge.  This whole amendment business, it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.  They say it's about protecting the people, but it's about  control. It's about silencing dissent.\n\nThe government, they ain't got no right to tell the churches what to do.  They ain't got no right to tell us what to believe.  It's a slippery slope, this whole thing. Where does it end? What's next, they tellin' us what to eat? What to wear? Who to love?\n\nThis here's America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. And we ain't gonna stand for this kind of tyranny.",
            "The air hung thick with ash, a curtain drawn over the land. A silence hung too, heavier than the dust, broken only by the rasp of the wind through the skeletal trees. He tasted it on his tongue, the grit of the dead world.  The war, they'd called it. A righteousness wrapped in lies, a whispered promise of swift justice. But it was a slow burn, this thing they'd wrought. A festering wound on the face of the earth.\n\nHe couldn't speak its name. The word tasted like copper and bile in his mouth.  It was a dog's growl, a child's whimper, a strangled cry. It was the echo of boots on ash, the ghosts of laughter choked by smoke.\n\nThey had said it was about freedom, about bringing democracy to a land of shadows. But freedom tasted like dust, and democracy was a fragile bloom in this barren landscape.  It was a lie told over and over, a story spun to mask the hunger in the hearts of men.\n\nThey had promised a quick victory, a swift ending to the nightmare. But victory tasted like ashes, like the bitter tang of grief. And the nightmare stretched on, a tapestry woven with blood and bone.\n\nHe looked at the boy, his face creased with weariness, eyes haunted by the emptiness of the world. They were both ghosts, they were both adrift in this wasteland.  The boy, he was the only thing that kept him tethered to the remnants of humanity. The only reason to keep walking, to keep searching for a flicker of hope in the endless gray.\n\nHe thought of the lakes he used to fish in, the woods where he used to hunt, the laughter of children playing in the streets. \n\nThey were gone now, swallowed by the dust and the silence.  \n\nHe would fight for the boy, he would fight for the memory of what they had lost. He would fight until his last breath. \n\nBut even in his heart, a cold fear took root.\n\nWhat if there was nothing left to fight for?  What if the world had already been consumed by the ashes?",
            "He spoke slow, his words catching like windblown leaves in the dry brush.  \"It's somethin' personal, this. Always been. A matter of the heart, like a vein runnin' wrong.  A twist in the blood.\" He paused, thumbing a worn spot on his worn sleeve.  \"Can't legislate that, can you? Can't make a man's soul sing to another man's soul if it ain't meant to be. It's deeper than that, see?  The books, the preachers, they say it's a choice.  But I ask you, can you choose the sun to rise in the east? Can you choose the way the wind whispers through the pines?\"\n\nHe spat a wad of tobacco juice into the dust. \"It's wrong, plain wrong, to deny a man the right to love, to build a life with another.  Just because some folks can't understand it, shouldn't mean they get to take it away.\"\n\nHis voice, low and rumbling, echoed in the vast emptiness around them. \"I see it in my neighborhood.  Folks livin' their lives, just like any other. Walkin' their dogs, tendin' their gardens, shapin' their little worlds.  Why should they be less?  Why should they have to hide?\"\n\nHe shook his head, the motion slow and weary. \"It ain't about God, not really. It's about fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of what they don't understand.  It's a sickness, that fear. It eats away at the heart, leaves nothin' but bitterness in its wake.\"  \n\n\nHe sighed, the sound a gust of wind through dry bones.  \"Let 'em try to legislate love, I say. Let 'em try to box it in, to control it. It'll just keep growin',  stronger, wilder.  Love always finds a way.\"",
            "The boy spoke, voice thin as a wire in the dead air.  \"You put somethin' on the internet, it's out there. Open road. Can't take it back.\"\n\nThe words hung, heavy as ash, in the silence.  A truth the boy knew in his bones, a truth etched in the dust and bone of the ravaged world. \"It's a public square,\" he went on, \"a gossip well that never runs dry. Say somethin' loud enough, someone's gonna hear.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy's question, the one that had followed them like a shadow across the scorched plains. \"What if you talk 'bout... blowin' things up?\" he'd asked. \"What if you talk 'bout shootin'?\"\n\nA grim smile tugged at the man's lips. \"Someone's gonna take notice.  And they'll act. Gotta act. Can't just leave it hangin' like a crows nest in the wind.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, small skull tilted, eyes dark as the empty sky. \"Like the school,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Like the school,\" the man agreed.\n\nHe remembered the whisperings, the fear that had crawled through the halls like a starved dog.  The boy's words, his innocence, a flickering candle in the encroaching dark.  \"It could be a joke,\" the man had said then. \"Some kid messin' around.\"\n\nBut the words lingered, a poison seed planted in fertile ground.  Someone heard. Someone saw.  And the world shifted, tilted on its axis.\n\n\"They gotta check,\" the man said now, voice gravelly from dust and despair. \"Can't ignore it.  Can't let it fester.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, eyes filled with a weariness beyond years. \"But,\" he added, \"you gotta be careful what you plant.\"\n\nThe boy looked down, fiddling with a loose thread on his ragged shirt. \"Can't control what people think,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"No,\" the man agreed. \"But you can control your words.  They're the seeds you sow.\"\n\nThe wind howled through the skeletal trees, a mournful lament for a world gone silent.  The sun, a pale ghost in the sky, offered no warmth, no hope.\n\nOnly the ashes.",
            "The war. It stretched on like a bad dream, a wound that wouldn't close.  At first, the purpose felt right, clear. To bring democracy to a land choked by iron. But somewhere along the way, the light had dimmed. Now it felt like a hunger, a need to prove something, to show the world the weight of our power.  \n\nThe motives, even then, felt muddy. Whispers of old scores, of debts owed and favors sought, lingered like smoke. The son of a man who'd tangled with that Saddam Hussein before, a puppet master pulling strings from afar.  \n\nDemocracy, a fine ideal. But the thirst for it had gone sour, the taste of it turned bitter. It seemed we'd made our point in the first blood-soaked months. The world had seen. Heard.  But the hammering went on. Years bled into years, the years bleeding into the young men whose lives were spilled on that arid ground. \n\nWe were fighting to win, to prove something, though what that something was, nobody seemed to say any more.  It felt like a bad habit, a sickness we couldn't shake.\n\nBillions spent, for what?  While our own cities crumbled, our own people starved. Poverty gnawed at the edges of our society, education withered, and healthcare became a luxury.\n\nWe were bleeding ourselves dry for a cause that had lost its way, a phantom in the desert wind.  It was time to stop. Time to let the desert sand claim its own. Time to turn our backs on the ghosts of tyrants and bring our sons home.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of ash and dust. He spoke, voice low, almost a rasp.  \"It's a question, ain't it? About the line we walk. What's seen, what's hidden.\" He paused, fingers tracing a worn groove in the table, the plastic worn smooth by time and weather. \"They say the world's wide open, everything laid out for the taking on them there computers. But is it truly open? Or is it just another kind of cage?\" He looked up, eyes shadowed, a storm gathering behind them.  \"You put something out there, even a word, a picture, and it ain't yours anymore, is it?\" \n\nHe shook his head slowly, letting the question hang in the air. \"This boy, this boy nearly slipped through the cracks. Someone saw, someone cared. Maybe that's the world we're cursed with now, a world where every shadow's watched, every breath a whisper in the wind. We think we're free, but the truth is, we're all just players in a vast, unending game. And the rules, well, they're changing faster than the desert wind.\"\n\nHe fell silent, staring into the dying embers of the fire. \"Is it right? Is it wrong? These questions, they gnaw at you, don't they? But the answers, they're buried deep, maybe deeper than we can find them.\"",
            "The air hung thick, a silence choked by dust and ash. Words, like brittle leaves, skittered across the barren landscape of his mind.  He knew what he had to say, what the world needed to hear. But the words, they wouldn't come easy. Not clean, not sharp.  They tangled, snagged on the barbs of doubt and the ghosts of a war fought in shadows long gone.\n\n\"It's a lie,\" he rasped, the sound catching in his throat like gravel. \"A goddamn lie.\"  \n\nHe felt a kinship with the ghosts of those who had come before, those who had fought and died on battlefields stripped bare, their voices swallowed by the endless wind. \"They say it was for freedom,\" he continued, his voice a low growl, \"for democracy. But freedom's a brittle thing, a whisper lost in the canyons of a dying land.\"\n\nHe traced the lines of his palm, the map of a life etched in hardship and sorrow. \"They don't understand,\" he muttered, his gaze fixed on the unforgiving horizon. \"They sit in their ivory towers, blind to the blood spilled in the name of their ambitions.\"\n\nThe statistics, they meant nothing. The numbers, cold and clinical, couldn't capture the weight of loss, the echoes of screams swallowed by the desert night. \n\n\"Eighty percent, they say,\" he croaked, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. \"Eighty percent of the world knows it was a mistake. But what good are numbers when faced with the desolate truth?\"\n\nHe looked up, his eyes searching the endless expanse, a plea for understanding lost in the swirling dust. \"There's no victory in this land,\" he whispered, his voice ragged with despair. \"Only the bitter taste of ash and the ghosts of broken promises.\"",
            "The air hung thick with it, this thing they called equality. A lie whispered in boardrooms, a ghost in the halls of power.  Women, they said, had come a long way. But the glass ceiling remained, a shimmering, unforgiving surface.  A man looking down might mistake it for clear sky, but those who climbed knew the truth. The weight of history pressed down, the echoes of an old world where a woman's place was in the home, her ambition stifled by societal expectations. \n\nIt wasn't just women, though. The fields of work, they had their own unforgiving borders.  A man at home with his children,  a shade of blue in a world of grays, faced scorn. \"The breadwinner,\" they called him, a title that stung like a branding iron.  \n\nAnd fashion, that world of spun silk and fleeting trends, it held its own prejudices. A man who dared to tread its paths, to speak of color and cut, was met with suspicion.  His words, twisted into doubts, his intentions questioned. \"A man in fashion?\" they'd sneer, \"Does he even know what women want?\"\n\nIt was a slow rot, this prejudice, ingrained in the very marrow of society.  But change, it came in whispers, in the quiet acts of defiance. A woman stepping into a boardroom, a man choosing to nurture instead of provide.  Slowly, the lines blurred, the borders softened. It was a long road, but every step counted.  One day, maybe, the world would see the truth: that strength came in all forms, that talent knew no gender, and that beauty resided not in conformity, but in the courage to be oneself.",
            "The talk was of laws, not of God. Decriminalization, they called it. A word like ash, settling on the tongue.  Not criminal, not anymore. More like a speeding ticket, a fine, a slap on the wrist. He'd heard the talk, the arguments: the cost of hauling men in, the weight of the courts, the drain on the treasury. Money, always money. A new kind of  poverty, a hunger for it.  But something else lingered beneath the talk, a shadow in the corners of the room. The fear, the whispers about jobs, about futures, about the stain that wouldn't wash. \n\nHe'd seen the way they looked at those marks, the way they clung to the old ways. Denver, they said, a haven. A place where the air was thin and the minds were open. Maybe. But even there, the smoke from the devil's herb hung heavy. A constant reminder of the things that lurked beneath the surface, the things that couldn't be spoken aloud. They decriminalized it, they said, but it still had teeth. Still held the power to bite. \n\nHe thought of his uncle, sitting in the old rowboat, the lake a mirror to the sky.  The silence between them, thick as the humid air.  The way his uncle watched the water, his eyes like old marbles, reflecting a world long gone.   They'd been silent, those days.  But he knew his uncle thought about it, about the things that were  unspeakable. The things that lingered in the corners of memory, the things that made the heart ache.",
            "The man sat, his gaze fixed on the dust motes dancing in the thin light filtering through the cracked windowpane. He shifted in his worn chair, the wood creaking a low protest. \"Yes,\" he said finally, his voice rough as gravel. \"Tradition. It's a weight, a thing you carry, a cloak that both warms and binds.\" He paused, his eyes drifting to the faded crucifix hanging crookedly on the wall. \"They say it's good, to be rooted. But the roots, they can strangle you too. They can keep you from seeing the world changing.\" \n\nHe sighed, the sound rasping in his chest. \"They cling to it, the old ways. The church, the rituals, the dogma. It's a fortress against the darkness, they say. But sometimes,\" he added, his voice dropping to a whisper, \"the darkness comes from within.\"\n\nHe looked up, his gaze lingering on the crucifix. \"They want you perfect, these people of the cloth. They want you to fold yourself into their mold, to fit the pattern. But there are cracks in the mold, fissures where the light breaks through. Where doubt takes root. And sometimes,\" he said, his voice hardening, \"those cracks are all that keep you sane.\"\n\n\nHe remembered his father, his face weathered and worn, his eyes filled with a quiet despair. He remembered the whispers in the shadows, the unspoken judgments. \"My father,\" he said, his voice barely audible, \"he was different. He didn't fit. They shunned him, they cast him out. And for what? For loving another, for daring to choose his own path?\"\n\nHe stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. \"It's hypocrisy, that's what it is. They preach love, but they build walls of exclusion. They speak of forgiveness, but they offer only judgment.\" He shook his head, his eyes filled with a weary anger. \"The world is changing, but they cling to the past. They're blind to the truth.\"\n\nHe walked to the window, his shadow stretching long and thin across the floor. \"The only truth,\" he said, his voice hollow, \"is in the heart. In the choices you make, the paths you choose. And sometimes, the hardest choice is to break free from the chains of tradition, to walk your own way, even if it leads you into the darkness.\"",
            "The line, it blurs. Church and state, a frayed seam in the fabric of this country. Two sides, locked in a dance, one foot on the altar, the other on the courthouse steps. Marriage, they say. A sacrament, they whisper.  A contract, they decree. But what's a contract but a promise, and what's a promise but a faith, a hope, a fragile thing in the face of this hard world?\n\nIt's a question that gnaws, a bone picked clean, leaving only the marrow of doubt.  Two bodies, bound. Two souls, entangled. The government, a cold judge, should it weigh in? Define this thing they call love, this thing that bleeds and births and breaks?\n\nBaptism, they say. A sacrament. But what of the unseen bonds, the ties that hold families together, the whispers of kinship that echo through generations? Should these be measured, weighed, cataloged by the state?  \n\nCivil unions, they say. A compromise. But is a contract a cradle, a haven?  Or just a cage, gilded but still a cage?  \n\nWhat of the love that cannot be contained, that spills over the edges of definition? It's a wildfire, a storm surge, a force beyond the grasp of law.  \n\nLet the states decide, some say. But what of the unity, the fabric of this nation, frayed by discord?  \n\nA constitutional amendment, a wall built to keep out the light. A monument to fear, not faith.  The constitution, it is a beacon, a promise of liberty, not a weapon to be wielded against the tender shoots of love.\n\nAmend it for a cause? For a fear? No.  Love isn't a battle to be fought, a cause to be won. It's a song, a whisper, a quiet truth that echoes in the chambers of the heart.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and ash.  The man spoke low, his words rasping like stones in a dry creek bed. \"Raised right, I was. Church every Sunday. Taught to believe. But these things, these… choices… they're a tangled thing, ain't they? Like a knot tied in a rope that won't come undone.\" \n\nHe shifted, the weight of the world settling on his shoulders. \"Friends I got, good friends, different.  I don't rightly say I understand it, this… this way of life. But they're my brothers, my kin.  Shouldn't be a sin, should it?  If two souls find peace in each other,  what right have we to judge?\"\n\nHis gaze drifted to the road ahead, a ribbon of dust winding through the desolate landscape. \"Each state, that's where it should be decided.  Let the people speak. Let them choose their own path, their own reckoning.  A man can't force his beliefs on another, no more than he can force the sun to rise in the west.\"\n\nHe spat a wad of tobacco into the dust. \"That man in Washington, he thinks he knows best, don't he?  But he ain't God.  He's a man, just like the rest of us, prone to error, to doubt, to fear.  Let the states decide.  Let it be a matter of conscience, not of decree.\"  \n\nHe fell silent, his eyes fixed on the horizon, a distant smudge of gray against the dying light. \"Some things,\" he murmured, \"are better left unsaid.  Some truths are too heavy to bear.\"",
            "The words hung there, half-formed, swallowed by the bleak silence. \"Public?\" he rasped, the word a brittle shard against the ash-grey landscape. \"Yeah, public. Like a billboard in the wasteland.\" A cough tore through him, a ragged rasp in the stillness.\n\n\"People seein' it, that's the point, ain't it?\" His gaze drifted across the sun-bleached expanse, where skeletal trees clawed at the leaden sky. \"They see your soul laid bare, your thoughts like vultures circling.\"\n\nHe shifted, the worn fabric of his coat whispering against his lean frame. \"School officials, they got a right, you think? To peek into your heart, see what's festerin' inside? Just 'cause they got a badge and a uniform?\"\n\nA long silence stretched, punctuated only by the wind's mournful sigh through the shattered branches. \"Maybe it's about safety,\" he finally muttered, his voice a dry whisper. \"Maybe they're lookin' for the storm clouds gatherin', the ones that might burst into fire.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, eyes shadowed and deep. \"But what if they find the wrong kind of storm? What if they think a dark thought is a threat, a whisper of rebellion a call to arms?\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his voice dropping to a low growl. \"They say everything you put out there stays out there. A ghost echoin' through the canyons of the internet. But what if they start huntin' ghosts? What if they start fearin' the shadows?\"\n\nHe looked back at the desolate landscape, his face etched with a weary resignation. \"Maybe they ain't savin' lives. Maybe they're just buryin' them deeper.\"",
            "The war. Nine Eleven.  The air hung thick with it then. Made a man want to pour oil on the fire, see it burn clean.  That's how I felt.  But now... now the ash settles. The smoke clears.  And you see the bones. \n\nWe went in like a fever, eyes glazed, hearts pounding.  Thought we'd strike the matches, set the world right.  Didn't stop to think about the wind.  Didn't think about where the sparks would fly.  Didn't think about the tinder, dry and waiting.   \n\nThey say chaos is a ladder, but in that place it was a tangled mess of roots, choking the light. We tried to prune it, carve order from the chaos.  But the more we cut, the more it bled.\n\nThey say you can't judge a people by their worst, but sometimes... sometimes the worst is all you see.  They fight amongst themselves, like wolves starving for scraps.  And you wonder, do they even know what it means to be human?\n\nMaybe that's the real mistake.  Going in there with our own measure of humanity, expecting it to fit.  It doesn't.  Their world is a different kind of darkness.  We brought our light, but it only burned brighter in the shadows.\n\nNow, the light fades.  The war drags on, a slow bleed.  We're losing ground, losing hope.  Maybe it's time to walk away.  Let the ashes settle.  Let the wind carry the whispers of what was.\n\nBut even in the silence, the ghosts of nine Eleven linger.  They'll stay with us, a shadow on the horizon, a reminder of the cost of anger, of the price of forgetting."
