            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. It needs changing. Its grip loosens, its flock scattering. Too much clinging to the old ways.  The things they say, they hang like a shroud over the world. Gay marriage. Abortion. Birth control.  The Church stands firm, an island in a sea of shifting sands. Their words, they cut like stones against the tide. \n\nThey say it's the way it's always been, that the world is wrong. But the world keeps turning. People are different now. They yearn for something more, something that doesn't feel like a prison of stone.\n\nThe old men in their robes, they clutch their scriptures like shields. They speak of sin and damnation, but the young, they hear a different song. The song of freedom, of acceptance, of a world where love isn't a battleground. \n\nA world where a man can love another man and call it holy, where a woman can choose her own path, where a body is not owned by doctrine.\n\nThe Church, it whispers of eternity. But what good is eternity if it's built on a foundation of fear?",
            "The word hung in the air, a question mark heavy with the dust of a dying sun. \"Gay marriage.\" He shifted his weight, the words catching in his throat like a bone. The air was thick with the unspoken, the weight of a world where shadows fell long and choices felt like stones dropped into a well.\n\nHe knew some folks, folks who lived lives woven tight with the threads of their beliefs, who'd say it was wrong. A sin, they'd murmur, a stain on the fabric of things.  But he'd seen the fire in a man's eyes when he talked of the woman he loved, the way his hand trembled when he held hers. He'd seen the solace in a couple's embrace, the quiet strength in their shared gaze. Love, he thought, wasn't a choice. It was a wildfire, burning with a fierce and untamed light.\n\nHe thought of the boy he knew, the one with the bright eyes and the laughter that rang like chimes in the wind. A boy who loved his grandpa, loved the feel of the sun on his face, loved the stories of long ago. He thought of how unfair it would be to deny that boy the same chance at happiness, the same right to love and be loved.\n\nHe couldn't say he'd wrestled with the words, hadn't spent nights pondering the scriptures or arguing with the shadows in his mind. But he knew this: love wasn't a thing to be measured, weighed, or controlled. It was a force of nature, a wild river carving its own path. And if a river chose to flow in a direction different from the one expected, should it be dammed or diverted?\n\nHe thought of the federal government, its vast and unknowable reach, its hands always reaching, always grasping. He thought of its pronouncements, its laws, its attempts to shape the world into its own image. And he wondered if love, that untamed, unyielding force, could ever truly be contained.",
            "The air hung thick and low, a shroud over the words. \"Gay marriage,\" he rasped, the word tasting like ash on his tongue. \"Seems like there ain't no good reason not to.\"\n\nHis voice was a whisper against the wind, a frail thing against the silence of the empty field. He shifted his weight, the bones of his old boots crunching in the dust.\n\n\"Folks say it's a threat,\" he went on, his voice barely audible. \"To the family. But it ain't the same, is it? Two sides of a coin, maybe. But the face changes.\"\n\nHe squinted at the horizon, where the sun bled into the dying light. A ragged line of blood against the gray. \"Rights, those are what it boils down to. Property, healthcare... if you're with someone, you should be with them, no matter what.\"\n\nHe paused, a tremor running through his hands. \"They say it's against God's will. But what God? Whose God? The one who sits in judgment from a pulpit or the one that whispers in the wind? You can't legislate faith, not when faith itself is a whisper.\"\n\nHis gaze drifted to the distant city, a hulking silhouette against the fading light. \"There's children involved, too. They need their parents, both of them. Not just the ones who happen to bleed the same.\"\n\nHe looked back at the empty field, the wind whipping his hair. \"This ain't about morality,\" he said, his voice barely a sigh. \"It's about love, about family, about human decency. Ain't that what matters? Ain't that what's worth fighting for?\"",
            "The air in the pharmacy hung thick with the smell of disinfectant and the ghosts of a thousand ailments. He had seen the shadows of death in those aisles, glimpsed them in the pale eyes of the dying and the chalky dust of their bones. And yet, the question before him was not of life or death but of a green, leafy thing, a weed that whispered promises of solace and oblivion.\n\n\"Just because it's outlawed,\" he said, his voice rasping like a rusty hinge, \"doesn't make it poison.\" He paused, the words catching in the dry air. \"The law's a fickle mistress, blind to truth and swayed by whispers.\" \n\nHe saw the unease in the other man's eyes, the flicker of judgment. \"There are things,\" he continued, \"things the law keeps locked away, things deemed dangerous, but used by those who know better. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets - names whispered in darkened rooms, pills dispensed with measured caution. Yet they ease pain, offer a reprieve from the world's harsh edges.\"\n\nHe let the silence settle, thick and heavy, then leaned forward. \"Marijuana. It's not a monster, not a demon to be feared. It's a whisper in the wind, a balm for the weary soul. To deny its potential, to cling to ignorance, that's the real crime.\"\n\nHe saw the other man's hesitation, the battle being waged in his gaze. \"A gradual easing,\" he offered, \"a lifting of the veil, not a sudden flood. Let people see its face, understand its nature. Then, perhaps, they'll use it wisely, not as a crutch, but as a tool.\"\n\nHe knew the fight was not won, not yet. But he'd planted a seed, a sliver of doubt in the sterile soil of fear. Maybe, just maybe, it would grow.",
            "The church, she's changed some. Evolved, I guess. Not the iron fist it used to be. When I was a child, Sundays meant a dress, shoes, purse - the whole shebang. Matching, of course. Private school, all the friends there, every week the same ritual. Now?  They've got this thing, a teenager mass. Thirty minutes flat.  Folks come straight from the beach, sand still in their hair, kids running late. Jeans, khakis - nobody's in their Sunday best anymore. Not even at the morning service, where I used to be all dressed up.  It's a different world in there now. \n\nThe truth is, that's all I know. The church I grew up in, the one with the stained glass and the smell of incense. Not the politics, not the whispers. Just the pews and the hymns.  Those things, they're the shadow of what else might be out there.\n\nAs for those stories, the ones about the priests... you can't blame the robes, the vows.  There are married men who do those things, too. It's a sickness, a darkness inside. You can't legislate against that. If a man's drawn to that kind of darkness, a wedding ring won't stop it.\n\nThere are other paths, other faiths where a man can be a man and a priest.  Didn't they have that on some show? Seventh Heaven, something like that? A minister, married, with kids.  Maybe that's where they belong, those who want both.",
            "The ash hung heavy, a shroud over everything. The air itself tasted of it, a metallic tang on the tongue.  He thought of the day, September eleventh, the way the world had cracked open and spilled its guts. A lie then, a lie now. Bin Laden, weapons of mass destruction, all smoke and mirrors. They’d gone in believing, or pretended to. The man gazed at the boy, at the innocence etched in his young face, and a bitter taste rose in his throat. He’d seen the truth in Powell’s eyes, the flicker of doubt even as he spun the web of deceit. Malfeasance. A word fit for a king, but a king who’d traded his crown for a shroud of lies.\n\nThe Constitution, twisted and contorted, a broken promise. The Bush men, father and son, fueled by vengeance and the scent of oil. War, a hungry beast, always wanting more.\n\nHe thought of the lake, a mirror reflecting the sky, the air thick with the smell of pine and rot. The oars, a steady rhythm, the only sound. His uncle, pipe clenched between his teeth, a silhouette against the dying light. A day carved in memory, a day before the world went mad.\n\nNow, the country bled, a slow, agonizing death. The boy would grow up knowing only the taste of ash. The UN, a hollow shell, the coalition a patchwork of broken promises.  The Parliament, a stage for the play of shadows, the puppet masters pulling the strings. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, adrift in a sea of chaos. Sadr, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, his fangs bared.\n\nHe closed his eyes, saw the boy’s face, the question in his eyes. Could he answer it? Could he explain the madness, the betrayal, the endless cycle of violence?\n\nThe world was broken. And he didn’t know how to fix it.",
            "The boy sat hunched, the plastic tarp a ragged shroud against the damp.  He spoke in a voice thin as a sparrow's call. \"How I feel about the war in Iraq.\" His words hung in the air, catching on the silence like smoke.\n\n\"Mmhmm,\" I said, my gaze fixed on the ash-streaked road that stretched before us, leading into the grayness.  \n\n\"Just talk into it?\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"Ok, cool.\"\n\nHe hesitated, his eyes fixed on the worn leather of his worn shoes. \"Um, at this point I feel it's kind of pointless. I mean, it ain't even a real war, not declared, you know?\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"And it feels like it was just a way to get back at Iraq, like payback for 9/11. You know, they figured that's who did it.\" He kicked at a loose stone, sending it skittering across the barren ground. \"I don't know the big picture, the details. But it feels like we're stuck there now, trying to build democracy. To make it another America. Like we're taking their land and their oil.\" He shook his head, the movement sluggish, weary. \"But it ain't right. It's making everyone angry.\"\n\nHe fell silent, his gaze drawn to the horizon where the sky bled into the dust. \"You forget things, don't you?\" he said finally, his voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, my voice rough. \"You forget what you want to remember, and remember what you want to forget.\"\n\n\nHe looked up at me, his eyes filled with a darkness that belied his years. \"What if it never ends?\" he asked, his voice trembling. \"What if we keep going back and forth, fighting, trying to make it something it's not?\"\n\nI had no answer for him. Only the wind, sighing through the ashes, a constant, mournful dirge.",
            "The air hung thick with the smell of dust and ashes. The man sat hunched in the shade of a bleached oak, its branches skeletal against the gray sky. His words were dry as the land itself, rasping out like the wind through dead leaves.\n\n\"It ain't right,\" he said, his voice a low rumble. \"Not right for the government to push its will on what the Lord's house should stand for. The Constitution, it says clear as day, separation of church and state. They try to tangle them up, they're going against what's been set down, what's carved in stone.\"\n\nHe spat a mouthful of tobacco juice onto the parched ground.\n\n\"They try to make it law, they're choosing one church's creed over another. The Catholics, the Christians, most of 'em, they're against it. But in some of those fancy cities, Boston, they're different. But that ain't the point. It ain't the government's place to decide what's right and wrong for souls.\" \n\nHe looked up at the endless expanse of sky, a bruised canvas of gray and blue.\n\n\"Separation, that's what it's all about. Tolerance. They want to change it, they're going against what the founders built. It ain't about restricting the people, it's about restricting the church. Ain't right.\"\n\nHe took a long drag from his cigarette, the ember glowing like a malevolent eye in the gloom.\n\n\"The government, they shouldn't be sniffing around this at all. The churches, they should be left to their own ways. This ain't about the economy or progress, it's about the soul. And the soul, that's a private affair.\" \n\nHe crushed the cigarette under his boot heel, the red glow fading into the dust.",
            "The air in Iraq hung thick, a shroud of dust and ash settling over everything like a bad memory. The government back home, they hadn't been straight with us, not about why we were there. 9/11, they said. A link to the terrorists. But it felt different, a lie whispered in the wind, a phantom echo of something else. They'd used our anger, our fear, to push us into this mess. 2003, the year the bombs fell, the year the world changed. \n\nWar. I ain't for it, never have been. A preemptive strike? That's just a fancy word for a fistfight before the other guy even throws a punch. Vietnam, they should've learned then. Same mistakes, same hollow victories.\n\nAmerican boys dying, good boys, for what? Just to rip out the heart of a country, leave it bleeding and broken. They talked about democracy, about planting new seeds, but they weren't prepared for the weeds that would grow, the ghosts that would rise from the dirt.  \n\nChaos, that's what they left behind. A vacuum, a power vacuum, sucking in the darkness. And we, we were the ones left to pick up the pieces.\n\nI remember the lake, years ago. My uncle, his straw hat pulled low, his pipe clenched between his teeth. We'd go out there for firewood, the air cold and sharp.  He'd tell me stories, about the old days, about the world before the darkness. He'd say, \"Some things you just can't control, son. The wind, the rain, the tide.\"\n\nBut the war, that wasn't something we couldn't control. It was us. We made it, and now we're stuck with it, like a stain on our souls.\n\nWe're still there, even now.  They talk about peace, about a new beginning, but the air is still thick with dust and ash. And the ghosts, they're still haunting us.",
            "The world, he thought, was gray. Ash-colored, like the bones of some long dead thing. And the bones, they knew. They knew the weight of the world, the burden of it. They knew the slow, relentless push of time. Same as the boy. Same as him.  \n\nHe believed in the rightness of it. This thing, this love, this union. It wasn't a choice, not in the way a man might choose to wear a hat or a coat. This was deeper, woven into the fabric of a man's being. As sure as the sun rose and set, as sure as the wind whispered through the trees.  \n\nHe'd seen it in his own neighborhood, in the quiet corners, the shared laughter, the unspoken understanding. Two men, two women, the same as any other couple, walking their dogs, sharing a meal, their lives a testament to something primal, something ancient.\n\nPolitics, he thought, were shadows. They danced and gestured, but they held no real power. This was a matter of the heart, a matter of the soul.  \n\nThey say it's a choice, they say it's a phase. But the boy, he knew better. He felt it too, the pull, the ache, the yearning. It was in his blood, in his bones.\n\nAnd God, he thought, God had a way of turning the world upside down. He'd seen it. He'd lived it. The world was full of shadows, but there were glimmers of light too. He held onto those glimmers, those fragile sparks of hope, like a man clinging to a raft in a storm.\n\nHe wouldn't let them extinguish the fire in his soul. Not while there was breath left in his body. Not while the boy still held his hand.",
            "The road stretched out like a vein of ash across the gutted landscape. Empty.  Sun a pale disc in the gray sky, barely piercing the dust.  He pushed the cart, the boy beside him, their shadows long and skeletal in the dust.  \n\n\"You think anyone else is out there?\" the boy asked. His voice thin, a whisper against the wind.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said. \"Maybe not.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence broken only by the scrape of the cart wheels on the cracked asphalt.  \n\n\"What if we were the only ones left?\" the boy asked, his eyes wide with a fear he tried to hide.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his face stained with dust, the lines around his eyes deep and etched. \"Then we'd have to take care of each other,\" he said.  \"That's all there is.\"\n\nThey stopped at the edge of a town, skeletal buildings rising from the ash like bleached bones.  Cars lay overturned, their metal hulls twisted and broken.  A silence hung over the place, thick and suffocating.\n\n\"It's like a graveyard,\" the boy murmured.\n\n\"Everything dies,\" he said, his voice rough. \"Even words. Even memories.\"\n\nThey walked through the streets, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay.  He felt a chill, not from the cold, but from the emptiness. The boy clung to his hand, his small fingers cold and clammy.\n\nThey found a house, its windows boarded up, its roof sagging.  He pushed open the door, the hinges groaning in protest. Inside, the air was stale and thick with the smell of dust and dampness.\n\n\"Someone lived here,\" the boy whispered, his voice echoing in the emptiness.\n\nHe nodded. \"Yes,\" he said. \"But they're gone now. Just like everyone else.\" \n\nThey sat down on the floor, the boy's head resting against his side.  He pulled the boy closer, trying to shield him from the cold, from the emptiness.\n\n\"Do you think there's still good in the world?\" the boy asked, his voice barely audible.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, the question hanging in the air between them.  He didn't know the answer.  He had seen too much darkness, too much pain.\n\nHe closed his eyes, trying to find a flicker of hope in the ashes. \"Maybe,\" he said, his voice a whisper. \"Maybe.\"",
            "The war. It stretched on, a festering wound. A purpose once clear, a noble aim to bring democracy to a land choked by tyranny.  But the light had dimmed. The reasons, once etched in righteousness, had blurred into something indistinct, something like a thirst for power, a hunger to prove dominion. The echoes of a father’s old quarrels, shadows cast by a past that lingered like smoke, clung to the edges of this manufactured conflict. \n\nWas it a just cause then? To free a people from shackles, to offer them the promise of a voice? Perhaps. But the years had bled away the purity. The initial blows, swift and decisive, had spoken volumes.  But the brutal dance of war continued, a macabre waltz with death, fueled by a need to conquer, to dominate. \n\nThe land itself seemed to wither under the weight of this protracted struggle. The coffers emptied, the blood spilled, the spirit broken.  A nation bled while its own children starved. The streets of its cities echoed with the cries of the forgotten, the silent pleas of those left behind. Billions diverted from schools and hospitals, from bridges and roads, poured into the maw of war, a bottomless pit of destruction.\n\nThere comes a point, he thought, when a people must stand on their own. When a nation must learn to defend its own destiny.  The time had come to withdraw, to sever the umbilical cord that bound them to this quagmire.  Let them face their demons, their own internal struggles.  Let them rise or fall by their own choices.",
            "The boy's voice, thin and reedy as a wind through the bone trees. \"Can I ask a question?\" \n\nHe turned from the cracked window, the gray light outside a reflection of the ash inside. \"Sure.\" \n\n\"About that thing... with the internet.\"\n\nHe knew. He could feel the boy's eyes on him, probing, wary. \"Maybe you shouldn't. Some things are best left unsaid.\"\n\n\"But someone saw something. And stopped it. Is that bad?\"\n\nHe leaned back, the rusted springs of the chair groaning. \"The world is full of shadows. Some places you don't want to look too hard.\"\n\nThe boy persisted. \"But if someone saw something bad... and stopped it... is that bad?\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, his face pale and drawn, etched with the same dust that clung to everything in this place.\n\n\"The internet,\" he said, \"is a mirror. And sometimes the things it shows are not meant for human eyes. Some things are better left buried.\"\n\nThe boy was silent. His eyes, dark and watchful, like those of a wild creature.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" he whispered, finally. \"It feels like...\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Like the bad things are always coming. Like we're running from them.\" \n\nHe reached out and touched the boy's shoulder, the flesh cold and thin beneath his hand.\n\n\"We are,\" he said, his voice hoarse. \"But we run together.\"",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, choked with the dust of a thousand broken promises. \"Hmm,\" he rasped, the sound catching in his throat like a bird with a broken wing. \"Um,\" he stumbled, words like stones tumbling down a dry gulch. \"We only have this, and then one more time about the war.  Um, yeah. I mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it, you know. I hate to say it, I hate to join that chorus of voices, the ones that bleat 'I was against it from the start.' Um, I was, but it's not about that anymore. The truth sits heavy now, a stone in the gut –  the consensus, even amidst the whispering halls of power, was that it was a fool's errand. A bad idea.\"  \n\nHe paused, letting the silence stretch, a shroud over the words unspoken. \"The polls are there, you see. United States, Iraq, the world. Seventy-five, eighty percent. They say it was a mistake. Eighty percent of the Iraqis themselves, seventy percent of the men sent to fight, they say it, too.  Pull out, they say. Within the year.  It's been a disaster, from the first breath of that poisoned wind. A festering wound, and now the healing, the pulling back, is another wound in waiting.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he sighed, the sound a crack in the dry earth. \"There's no easy way out in that tangled desert. It's a clash, you see? A storm of cultures, a gulf too wide to bridge. The administration, they don't understand. They think they can force their light on a land that doesn't want it. Democracy, a seed sown in barren ground, choked by the dust of difference. Yes, Saddam was a monster, but was this the answer? To tear down a tyrant and build a phantom in its place?\"\n\nHe looked away, his gaze lost in the dust devils dancing across the wasteland of his words. \" Just quicksand, all of it.  I don't know what to say.  There's no reason to stay.  They'll have their justifications, their carefully crafted narratives, but they're empty words.  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, a quarter say now.  We're trying to help them, they tell us to leave. Maybe they know better. Maybe they know what's best for them.\"   He thought of the exodus, a slow, agonizing crawl back into the darkness. \"Gradual, maybe. A year, a little longer, but no more.  We can't be the saviors, not anymore. We're just a stain on the land.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the stink of ash and memory. He knew, yes, knew it in the bone-deep chill that settled on him like a shroud. Gendered judgment, it was a hunger that gnawed at the belly of the world, a sickness that festered in the marrow. Women, men, bound by the same chains, each to their own appointed role. \n\nHe'd seen it in the way the city, a skeletal carcass of concrete and steel, still held its breath, waiting for the day when men would rise again to claim it, to rebuild the monuments of their own making. The women, they lingered in the shadows, ghosts in dresses of dust, their whispers lost on the wind.  \n\nIt wasn't just the women, though.  He saw it in the hard eyes of the men who worked the empty fields, their calloused hands clutching at the tattered remnants of pride. The men who stayed home, tending to the ashes of broken dreams, their spirits withered like the crops.\n\nThey all wore the scars, these men and women, the marks of a world that refused to let them be whole. And the truth was, the world saw them only in fragments, a shattered reflection of what it wished them to be. A woman in a chair, a man with calloused hands, a boy with a book. Nothing more.\n\nHe thought of the young ones, the children who were still learning the language of this broken world. They would carry the weight of these judgments, these invisible shackles, until they, too, learned to wear the masks of conformity.  \n\nBut he saw a flicker of hope in their eyes, a defiant spark that refused to be extinguished. They were the seeds of change, waiting to bloom in the ashes of the old world. They would be the ones to break the chains, to rewrite the story. They would be the ones to build a world where gender was not a cage, where the human heart was free to soar.",
            "The air hung thick and cold. They said it wasn't legal, not really. Decriminalized, they called it. A slap on the wrist, a fine, not the cold steel of the cage. But the fear, the shadow of it, lingered. The marks it left, on your soul, on your chances. It lingered in the whispers, in the eyes of men, in the silence between words.  \n\nThey said it freed up money. Money for schools, for the hungry, for the sick. Money they could use to mend the cracks in this broken world. But the cracks ran deep. The heart of the matter, they said, was the money.\n\nSome places, the old ways held tight. Stubborn, clinging to the fear. But others, they saw the light. Denver, they called it. A place where the wind carried whispers of change, where the old ways crumbled in the face of a new dawn.\n\nMaybe, he thought, it wasn't about the money. Maybe it was about the change. The way it seeped into the air, the way it shifted the ground beneath your feet. The way it made you question everything you thought you knew.\n\nHe saw it in the faces of the young, the way their eyes lit up with a dangerous hope. They weren't afraid of the shadows. They wanted to dance in them.\n\nBut the old ways, they cast a long shadow. A shadow that stretched across the years, across generations. A shadow that whispered of danger, of loss, of a world that could never be fully reclaimed.\n\nHe remembered the lake, the stillness of the water, the smell of pine needles and damp earth. The slow, rhythmic stroke of the oars, the creaking of the boat. His uncle's pipe, the smoke curling in the air. A moment of perfect peace, a memory etched in the heart of the past.\n\nBut the world moved on. The shadows lengthened. And the wind carried a new kind of smoke.",
            "The thing is, yeah, they do things a certain way. Old ways. Been doing 'em for a spell.  Rooted, you know? But the world ain't what it was. Times change. Gotta bend a little.  \n\nThey say church every week, gotta follow the book.  Strict, that's for sure.  And they look down on folks who don't fit the mold.  Folks who ain't perfect. Folks who pray to a different God.  \n\nLike my old man.  Episcopalian.  My Ma, Catholic.  Wouldn't marry them in the Church.  Said it was against the rules.  Hypocrisy, I tell ya.  Love your neighbor, they say. But turn your back on 'em if they ain't one of them. \n\nIt's like the rules are one thing, and the way they live another.  Old ways dying hard, that's for sure.\n\nNow, about those priests...\n\nThey say letting 'em marry would fix things.  Make 'em better men.  But that ain't the root of the problem, is it?  Some folks, they got a sickness.  Don't matter if they got a wife or not.  They gonna do what they gonna do.\n\nIt ain't about marriage, it's about the darkness inside.",
            "The thing is, the way things stand now, it's a knot you can't untie. Church and state, marriage, it's all tangled up.  One hand reaching for the other, grabbing hold, and you can't say if one's right or wrong.  It's a hard sort of question, see?  Something as close as that,  it cuts both ways. \n\nWhat's marriage anyway?  Government business or something else?   If it's a sacrament, shouldn't the church be the one to decide? Like baptism, it's a matter of faith.  No tax breaks, no special treatment from the state. Just two souls bound together. \n\nBut if it's just two people, why the fuss? Why not call it a civil union?  What difference does it make? It's a joining, a commitment. \n\nAnd this whole business with gay marriage... it's like they're trying to draw lines in the sand.  Two souls, just like any other, wanting to join.  Why deny them that? \n\nMaybe if all the states could see eye to eye, they could make it a law.  But a constitutional amendment to ban it? That's just wrong.  The Constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.  It's not some great moral crisis.  It's just love, plain and simple.\n\n\nNo.  An amendment? That's just too much.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and ash. He shifted the weight of the world on his shoulders, a world that seemed to tilt on its axis, forever teetering between light and dark.  The question, it coiled in his gut like a snake, cold and insistent. It slithered through his mind, leaving a trail of unease.  Homosexuality. A word that tasted like brimstone in his mouth.  \n\nHe’d been raised in the shadow of a steeple, bathed in the glow of Sunday sermons.  But the world outside, the world he’d come to know, it was a tangled mess of contradictions. He had friends, bright souls with laughter in their eyes, who walked a path different from his own. A path that led them to solace in each other’s arms, a love that burned with a fierce, undeniable light.\n\nThe law, it was a tangled web spun by men with hands stained with hypocrisy. Should the weight of their judgment, their fear, dictate the course of another’s life? He didn’t have the answers, not the kind that would satisfy the searching in his soul. But he knew this:  \n\nLove, it was a river, ever flowing, ever changing. To try to dam it, to confine it within the rigid banks of man-made laws, was to invite catastrophe.\n\nThe states, they were the building blocks of this nation, each a microcosm of its own desires, its own demons.  Some, they held fast to the old ways, their hearts hardened by tradition. Others, they embraced the new, their souls open to the possibility of change.\n\nHe wasn’t a man of power, not a king nor a congressman. But he knew this:  A man’s heart, it belonged to him alone. To love, to choose, to find solace in another’s embrace, these were the truest expressions of his freedom.  And if the law could not, or would not, protect that freedom, then it was a law that had lost its way.",
            "The boy huddled close, his breath a thin hiss in the cold.  \"We going to die?\" he asked. The question hung in the air, a bone sliver in the gray silence.\n\nThe man looked at him, the firelight catching the hard angles of his face. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice a rasp. \"Sometime. But not now.\"\n\nThe boy shivered. \"We still going south?\"\n\n\"Yes. We'll be warm.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, a small sound lost in the wind. He stared into the flames, his eyes dark and unblinking.  The man watched him, a cold knot in his gut.  He knew the boy was too young to understand, too young to grasp the bleak weight of their journey.\n\nOutside, the wind howled a mournful song, rattling the bones of the abandoned shack. The world was a canvas of ash and shadow, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay. They had been traveling for weeks, ever since the city had fallen. Since the fire had come.  \n\nHe had seen things, things that would stain his soul. Things he could never unsee. But the boy, he was still innocent. Still held onto a sliver of hope. The man wouldn't allow that hope to be extinguished. He would protect it, even if it meant sacrificing everything else.\n\nHe pulled his threadbare cloak tighter around him, the worn fabric offering little comfort against the cold. The fire sputtered, sending a shower of sparks into the night. He reached out and took the boy's hand, feeling the small, trembling fingers clutch at his own.\n\n\"Do you think God sees us?\" the boy asked.\n\nThe man squeezed his hand, his gaze fixed on the dancing flames. \"He sees everything,\" he said, his voice barely a whisper.",
            "The dust of the world clung to everything. The air itself tasted like ash. The war. It had begun in the gut, a knot of rage after the towers fell.  A rising tide of vengeance. He'd been ready to go, to drown the hatred in blood.  But the blood hadn't washed it clean.  Just stained it deeper.\n\nHe'd seen the truth in the long nights, the hollow echoes of reason lost in the howling wind. They went in blind, fists clenched, hearts aflame. No plan, no map. Just a thirst for retribution.  \n\nAnd the wasteland they'd carved out, it mirrored the emptiness inside. The people there, they were caught in a different kind of war, a war without rules, without reason. A war fought with the tools of survival.\n\nHe'd seen their faces, the weary eyes, the hard lines etched deep by a kind of hunger that couldn't be appeased. They were fighting for scraps, for a sliver of hope in a world gone mad.  And they saw him, a stranger, a bringer of his own kind of chaos.\n\nThey were not savages, not monsters. Just men and women trying to survive in a world where survival meant fighting.\n\nHe'd lost the fire in his belly, replaced by a cold, gnawing understanding. The war had birthed a monster, and they were all feeding it.  He had no answers, only the ashes of what had been.  Only the knowledge that they should have stayed away."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. It needs changing. Its grip loosens, its flock scattering. Too much clinging to the old ways.  The things they say, they hang like a shroud over the world. Gay marriage. Abortion. Birth control.  The Church stands firm, an island in a sea of shifting sands. Their words, they cut like stones against the tide. \n\nThey say it's the way it's always been, that the world is wrong. But the world keeps turning. People are different now. They yearn for something more, something that doesn't feel like a prison of stone.\n\nThe old men in their robes, they clutch their scriptures like shields. They speak of sin and damnation, but the young, they hear a different song. The song of freedom, of acceptance, of a world where love isn't a battleground. \n\nA world where a man can love another man and call it holy, where a woman can choose her own path, where a body is not owned by doctrine.\n\nThe Church, it whispers of eternity. But what good is eternity if it's built on a foundation of fear?",
            "The word hung in the air, a question mark heavy with the dust of a dying sun. \"Gay marriage.\" He shifted his weight, the words catching in his throat like a bone. The air was thick with the unspoken, the weight of a world where shadows fell long and choices felt like stones dropped into a well.\n\nHe knew some folks, folks who lived lives woven tight with the threads of their beliefs, who'd say it was wrong. A sin, they'd murmur, a stain on the fabric of things.  But he'd seen the fire in a man's eyes when he talked of the woman he loved, the way his hand trembled when he held hers. He'd seen the solace in a couple's embrace, the quiet strength in their shared gaze. Love, he thought, wasn't a choice. It was a wildfire, burning with a fierce and untamed light.\n\nHe thought of the boy he knew, the one with the bright eyes and the laughter that rang like chimes in the wind. A boy who loved his grandpa, loved the feel of the sun on his face, loved the stories of long ago. He thought of how unfair it would be to deny that boy the same chance at happiness, the same right to love and be loved.\n\nHe couldn't say he'd wrestled with the words, hadn't spent nights pondering the scriptures or arguing with the shadows in his mind. But he knew this: love wasn't a thing to be measured, weighed, or controlled. It was a force of nature, a wild river carving its own path. And if a river chose to flow in a direction different from the one expected, should it be dammed or diverted?\n\nHe thought of the federal government, its vast and unknowable reach, its hands always reaching, always grasping. He thought of its pronouncements, its laws, its attempts to shape the world into its own image. And he wondered if love, that untamed, unyielding force, could ever truly be contained.",
            "The air hung thick and low, a shroud over the words. \"Gay marriage,\" he rasped, the word tasting like ash on his tongue. \"Seems like there ain't no good reason not to.\"\n\nHis voice was a whisper against the wind, a frail thing against the silence of the empty field. He shifted his weight, the bones of his old boots crunching in the dust.\n\n\"Folks say it's a threat,\" he went on, his voice barely audible. \"To the family. But it ain't the same, is it? Two sides of a coin, maybe. But the face changes.\"\n\nHe squinted at the horizon, where the sun bled into the dying light. A ragged line of blood against the gray. \"Rights, those are what it boils down to. Property, healthcare... if you're with someone, you should be with them, no matter what.\"\n\nHe paused, a tremor running through his hands. \"They say it's against God's will. But what God? Whose God? The one who sits in judgment from a pulpit or the one that whispers in the wind? You can't legislate faith, not when faith itself is a whisper.\"\n\nHis gaze drifted to the distant city, a hulking silhouette against the fading light. \"There's children involved, too. They need their parents, both of them. Not just the ones who happen to bleed the same.\"\n\nHe looked back at the empty field, the wind whipping his hair. \"This ain't about morality,\" he said, his voice barely a sigh. \"It's about love, about family, about human decency. Ain't that what matters? Ain't that what's worth fighting for?\"",
            "The air in the pharmacy hung thick with the smell of disinfectant and the ghosts of a thousand ailments. He had seen the shadows of death in those aisles, glimpsed them in the pale eyes of the dying and the chalky dust of their bones. And yet, the question before him was not of life or death but of a green, leafy thing, a weed that whispered promises of solace and oblivion.\n\n\"Just because it's outlawed,\" he said, his voice rasping like a rusty hinge, \"doesn't make it poison.\" He paused, the words catching in the dry air. \"The law's a fickle mistress, blind to truth and swayed by whispers.\" \n\nHe saw the unease in the other man's eyes, the flicker of judgment. \"There are things,\" he continued, \"things the law keeps locked away, things deemed dangerous, but used by those who know better. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets - names whispered in darkened rooms, pills dispensed with measured caution. Yet they ease pain, offer a reprieve from the world's harsh edges.\"\n\nHe let the silence settle, thick and heavy, then leaned forward. \"Marijuana. It's not a monster, not a demon to be feared. It's a whisper in the wind, a balm for the weary soul. To deny its potential, to cling to ignorance, that's the real crime.\"\n\nHe saw the other man's hesitation, the battle being waged in his gaze. \"A gradual easing,\" he offered, \"a lifting of the veil, not a sudden flood. Let people see its face, understand its nature. Then, perhaps, they'll use it wisely, not as a crutch, but as a tool.\"\n\nHe knew the fight was not won, not yet. But he'd planted a seed, a sliver of doubt in the sterile soil of fear. Maybe, just maybe, it would grow.",
            "The church, she's changed some. Evolved, I guess. Not the iron fist it used to be. When I was a child, Sundays meant a dress, shoes, purse - the whole shebang. Matching, of course. Private school, all the friends there, every week the same ritual. Now?  They've got this thing, a teenager mass. Thirty minutes flat.  Folks come straight from the beach, sand still in their hair, kids running late. Jeans, khakis - nobody's in their Sunday best anymore. Not even at the morning service, where I used to be all dressed up.  It's a different world in there now. \n\nThe truth is, that's all I know. The church I grew up in, the one with the stained glass and the smell of incense. Not the politics, not the whispers. Just the pews and the hymns.  Those things, they're the shadow of what else might be out there.\n\nAs for those stories, the ones about the priests... you can't blame the robes, the vows.  There are married men who do those things, too. It's a sickness, a darkness inside. You can't legislate against that. If a man's drawn to that kind of darkness, a wedding ring won't stop it.\n\nThere are other paths, other faiths where a man can be a man and a priest.  Didn't they have that on some show? Seventh Heaven, something like that? A minister, married, with kids.  Maybe that's where they belong, those who want both.",
            "The ash hung heavy, a shroud over everything. The air itself tasted of it, a metallic tang on the tongue.  He thought of the day, September eleventh, the way the world had cracked open and spilled its guts. A lie then, a lie now. Bin Laden, weapons of mass destruction, all smoke and mirrors. They’d gone in believing, or pretended to. The man gazed at the boy, at the innocence etched in his young face, and a bitter taste rose in his throat. He’d seen the truth in Powell’s eyes, the flicker of doubt even as he spun the web of deceit. Malfeasance. A word fit for a king, but a king who’d traded his crown for a shroud of lies.\n\nThe Constitution, twisted and contorted, a broken promise. The Bush men, father and son, fueled by vengeance and the scent of oil. War, a hungry beast, always wanting more.\n\nHe thought of the lake, a mirror reflecting the sky, the air thick with the smell of pine and rot. The oars, a steady rhythm, the only sound. His uncle, pipe clenched between his teeth, a silhouette against the dying light. A day carved in memory, a day before the world went mad.\n\nNow, the country bled, a slow, agonizing death. The boy would grow up knowing only the taste of ash. The UN, a hollow shell, the coalition a patchwork of broken promises.  The Parliament, a stage for the play of shadows, the puppet masters pulling the strings. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, adrift in a sea of chaos. Sadr, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, his fangs bared.\n\nHe closed his eyes, saw the boy’s face, the question in his eyes. Could he answer it? Could he explain the madness, the betrayal, the endless cycle of violence?\n\nThe world was broken. And he didn’t know how to fix it.",
            "The boy sat hunched, the plastic tarp a ragged shroud against the damp.  He spoke in a voice thin as a sparrow's call. \"How I feel about the war in Iraq.\" His words hung in the air, catching on the silence like smoke.\n\n\"Mmhmm,\" I said, my gaze fixed on the ash-streaked road that stretched before us, leading into the grayness.  \n\n\"Just talk into it?\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"Ok, cool.\"\n\nHe hesitated, his eyes fixed on the worn leather of his worn shoes. \"Um, at this point I feel it's kind of pointless. I mean, it ain't even a real war, not declared, you know?\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"And it feels like it was just a way to get back at Iraq, like payback for 9/11. You know, they figured that's who did it.\" He kicked at a loose stone, sending it skittering across the barren ground. \"I don't know the big picture, the details. But it feels like we're stuck there now, trying to build democracy. To make it another America. Like we're taking their land and their oil.\" He shook his head, the movement sluggish, weary. \"But it ain't right. It's making everyone angry.\"\n\nHe fell silent, his gaze drawn to the horizon where the sky bled into the dust. \"You forget things, don't you?\" he said finally, his voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, my voice rough. \"You forget what you want to remember, and remember what you want to forget.\"\n\n\nHe looked up at me, his eyes filled with a darkness that belied his years. \"What if it never ends?\" he asked, his voice trembling. \"What if we keep going back and forth, fighting, trying to make it something it's not?\"\n\nI had no answer for him. Only the wind, sighing through the ashes, a constant, mournful dirge.",
            "The air hung thick with the smell of dust and ashes. The man sat hunched in the shade of a bleached oak, its branches skeletal against the gray sky. His words were dry as the land itself, rasping out like the wind through dead leaves.\n\n\"It ain't right,\" he said, his voice a low rumble. \"Not right for the government to push its will on what the Lord's house should stand for. The Constitution, it says clear as day, separation of church and state. They try to tangle them up, they're going against what's been set down, what's carved in stone.\"\n\nHe spat a mouthful of tobacco juice onto the parched ground.\n\n\"They try to make it law, they're choosing one church's creed over another. The Catholics, the Christians, most of 'em, they're against it. But in some of those fancy cities, Boston, they're different. But that ain't the point. It ain't the government's place to decide what's right and wrong for souls.\" \n\nHe looked up at the endless expanse of sky, a bruised canvas of gray and blue.\n\n\"Separation, that's what it's all about. Tolerance. They want to change it, they're going against what the founders built. It ain't about restricting the people, it's about restricting the church. Ain't right.\"\n\nHe took a long drag from his cigarette, the ember glowing like a malevolent eye in the gloom.\n\n\"The government, they shouldn't be sniffing around this at all. The churches, they should be left to their own ways. This ain't about the economy or progress, it's about the soul. And the soul, that's a private affair.\" \n\nHe crushed the cigarette under his boot heel, the red glow fading into the dust.",
            "The air in Iraq hung thick, a shroud of dust and ash settling over everything like a bad memory. The government back home, they hadn't been straight with us, not about why we were there. 9/11, they said. A link to the terrorists. But it felt different, a lie whispered in the wind, a phantom echo of something else. They'd used our anger, our fear, to push us into this mess. 2003, the year the bombs fell, the year the world changed. \n\nWar. I ain't for it, never have been. A preemptive strike? That's just a fancy word for a fistfight before the other guy even throws a punch. Vietnam, they should've learned then. Same mistakes, same hollow victories.\n\nAmerican boys dying, good boys, for what? Just to rip out the heart of a country, leave it bleeding and broken. They talked about democracy, about planting new seeds, but they weren't prepared for the weeds that would grow, the ghosts that would rise from the dirt.  \n\nChaos, that's what they left behind. A vacuum, a power vacuum, sucking in the darkness. And we, we were the ones left to pick up the pieces.\n\nI remember the lake, years ago. My uncle, his straw hat pulled low, his pipe clenched between his teeth. We'd go out there for firewood, the air cold and sharp.  He'd tell me stories, about the old days, about the world before the darkness. He'd say, \"Some things you just can't control, son. The wind, the rain, the tide.\"\n\nBut the war, that wasn't something we couldn't control. It was us. We made it, and now we're stuck with it, like a stain on our souls.\n\nWe're still there, even now.  They talk about peace, about a new beginning, but the air is still thick with dust and ash. And the ghosts, they're still haunting us.",
            "The world, he thought, was gray. Ash-colored, like the bones of some long dead thing. And the bones, they knew. They knew the weight of the world, the burden of it. They knew the slow, relentless push of time. Same as the boy. Same as him.  \n\nHe believed in the rightness of it. This thing, this love, this union. It wasn't a choice, not in the way a man might choose to wear a hat or a coat. This was deeper, woven into the fabric of a man's being. As sure as the sun rose and set, as sure as the wind whispered through the trees.  \n\nHe'd seen it in his own neighborhood, in the quiet corners, the shared laughter, the unspoken understanding. Two men, two women, the same as any other couple, walking their dogs, sharing a meal, their lives a testament to something primal, something ancient.\n\nPolitics, he thought, were shadows. They danced and gestured, but they held no real power. This was a matter of the heart, a matter of the soul.  \n\nThey say it's a choice, they say it's a phase. But the boy, he knew better. He felt it too, the pull, the ache, the yearning. It was in his blood, in his bones.\n\nAnd God, he thought, God had a way of turning the world upside down. He'd seen it. He'd lived it. The world was full of shadows, but there were glimmers of light too. He held onto those glimmers, those fragile sparks of hope, like a man clinging to a raft in a storm.\n\nHe wouldn't let them extinguish the fire in his soul. Not while there was breath left in his body. Not while the boy still held his hand.",
            "The road stretched out like a vein of ash across the gutted landscape. Empty.  Sun a pale disc in the gray sky, barely piercing the dust.  He pushed the cart, the boy beside him, their shadows long and skeletal in the dust.  \n\n\"You think anyone else is out there?\" the boy asked. His voice thin, a whisper against the wind.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said. \"Maybe not.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence broken only by the scrape of the cart wheels on the cracked asphalt.  \n\n\"What if we were the only ones left?\" the boy asked, his eyes wide with a fear he tried to hide.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his face stained with dust, the lines around his eyes deep and etched. \"Then we'd have to take care of each other,\" he said.  \"That's all there is.\"\n\nThey stopped at the edge of a town, skeletal buildings rising from the ash like bleached bones.  Cars lay overturned, their metal hulls twisted and broken.  A silence hung over the place, thick and suffocating.\n\n\"It's like a graveyard,\" the boy murmured.\n\n\"Everything dies,\" he said, his voice rough. \"Even words. Even memories.\"\n\nThey walked through the streets, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay.  He felt a chill, not from the cold, but from the emptiness. The boy clung to his hand, his small fingers cold and clammy.\n\nThey found a house, its windows boarded up, its roof sagging.  He pushed open the door, the hinges groaning in protest. Inside, the air was stale and thick with the smell of dust and dampness.\n\n\"Someone lived here,\" the boy whispered, his voice echoing in the emptiness.\n\nHe nodded. \"Yes,\" he said. \"But they're gone now. Just like everyone else.\" \n\nThey sat down on the floor, the boy's head resting against his side.  He pulled the boy closer, trying to shield him from the cold, from the emptiness.\n\n\"Do you think there's still good in the world?\" the boy asked, his voice barely audible.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, the question hanging in the air between them.  He didn't know the answer.  He had seen too much darkness, too much pain.\n\nHe closed his eyes, trying to find a flicker of hope in the ashes. \"Maybe,\" he said, his voice a whisper. \"Maybe.\"",
            "The war. It stretched on, a festering wound. A purpose once clear, a noble aim to bring democracy to a land choked by tyranny.  But the light had dimmed. The reasons, once etched in righteousness, had blurred into something indistinct, something like a thirst for power, a hunger to prove dominion. The echoes of a father’s old quarrels, shadows cast by a past that lingered like smoke, clung to the edges of this manufactured conflict. \n\nWas it a just cause then? To free a people from shackles, to offer them the promise of a voice? Perhaps. But the years had bled away the purity. The initial blows, swift and decisive, had spoken volumes.  But the brutal dance of war continued, a macabre waltz with death, fueled by a need to conquer, to dominate. \n\nThe land itself seemed to wither under the weight of this protracted struggle. The coffers emptied, the blood spilled, the spirit broken.  A nation bled while its own children starved. The streets of its cities echoed with the cries of the forgotten, the silent pleas of those left behind. Billions diverted from schools and hospitals, from bridges and roads, poured into the maw of war, a bottomless pit of destruction.\n\nThere comes a point, he thought, when a people must stand on their own. When a nation must learn to defend its own destiny.  The time had come to withdraw, to sever the umbilical cord that bound them to this quagmire.  Let them face their demons, their own internal struggles.  Let them rise or fall by their own choices.",
            "The boy's voice, thin and reedy as a wind through the bone trees. \"Can I ask a question?\" \n\nHe turned from the cracked window, the gray light outside a reflection of the ash inside. \"Sure.\" \n\n\"About that thing... with the internet.\"\n\nHe knew. He could feel the boy's eyes on him, probing, wary. \"Maybe you shouldn't. Some things are best left unsaid.\"\n\n\"But someone saw something. And stopped it. Is that bad?\"\n\nHe leaned back, the rusted springs of the chair groaning. \"The world is full of shadows. Some places you don't want to look too hard.\"\n\nThe boy persisted. \"But if someone saw something bad... and stopped it... is that bad?\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, his face pale and drawn, etched with the same dust that clung to everything in this place.\n\n\"The internet,\" he said, \"is a mirror. And sometimes the things it shows are not meant for human eyes. Some things are better left buried.\"\n\nThe boy was silent. His eyes, dark and watchful, like those of a wild creature.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" he whispered, finally. \"It feels like...\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Like the bad things are always coming. Like we're running from them.\" \n\nHe reached out and touched the boy's shoulder, the flesh cold and thin beneath his hand.\n\n\"We are,\" he said, his voice hoarse. \"But we run together.\"",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, choked with the dust of a thousand broken promises. \"Hmm,\" he rasped, the sound catching in his throat like a bird with a broken wing. \"Um,\" he stumbled, words like stones tumbling down a dry gulch. \"We only have this, and then one more time about the war.  Um, yeah. I mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it, you know. I hate to say it, I hate to join that chorus of voices, the ones that bleat 'I was against it from the start.' Um, I was, but it's not about that anymore. The truth sits heavy now, a stone in the gut –  the consensus, even amidst the whispering halls of power, was that it was a fool's errand. A bad idea.\"  \n\nHe paused, letting the silence stretch, a shroud over the words unspoken. \"The polls are there, you see. United States, Iraq, the world. Seventy-five, eighty percent. They say it was a mistake. Eighty percent of the Iraqis themselves, seventy percent of the men sent to fight, they say it, too.  Pull out, they say. Within the year.  It's been a disaster, from the first breath of that poisoned wind. A festering wound, and now the healing, the pulling back, is another wound in waiting.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he sighed, the sound a crack in the dry earth. \"There's no easy way out in that tangled desert. It's a clash, you see? A storm of cultures, a gulf too wide to bridge. The administration, they don't understand. They think they can force their light on a land that doesn't want it. Democracy, a seed sown in barren ground, choked by the dust of difference. Yes, Saddam was a monster, but was this the answer? To tear down a tyrant and build a phantom in its place?\"\n\nHe looked away, his gaze lost in the dust devils dancing across the wasteland of his words. \" Just quicksand, all of it.  I don't know what to say.  There's no reason to stay.  They'll have their justifications, their carefully crafted narratives, but they're empty words.  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, a quarter say now.  We're trying to help them, they tell us to leave. Maybe they know better. Maybe they know what's best for them.\"   He thought of the exodus, a slow, agonizing crawl back into the darkness. \"Gradual, maybe. A year, a little longer, but no more.  We can't be the saviors, not anymore. We're just a stain on the land.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the stink of ash and memory. He knew, yes, knew it in the bone-deep chill that settled on him like a shroud. Gendered judgment, it was a hunger that gnawed at the belly of the world, a sickness that festered in the marrow. Women, men, bound by the same chains, each to their own appointed role. \n\nHe'd seen it in the way the city, a skeletal carcass of concrete and steel, still held its breath, waiting for the day when men would rise again to claim it, to rebuild the monuments of their own making. The women, they lingered in the shadows, ghosts in dresses of dust, their whispers lost on the wind.  \n\nIt wasn't just the women, though.  He saw it in the hard eyes of the men who worked the empty fields, their calloused hands clutching at the tattered remnants of pride. The men who stayed home, tending to the ashes of broken dreams, their spirits withered like the crops.\n\nThey all wore the scars, these men and women, the marks of a world that refused to let them be whole. And the truth was, the world saw them only in fragments, a shattered reflection of what it wished them to be. A woman in a chair, a man with calloused hands, a boy with a book. Nothing more.\n\nHe thought of the young ones, the children who were still learning the language of this broken world. They would carry the weight of these judgments, these invisible shackles, until they, too, learned to wear the masks of conformity.  \n\nBut he saw a flicker of hope in their eyes, a defiant spark that refused to be extinguished. They were the seeds of change, waiting to bloom in the ashes of the old world. They would be the ones to break the chains, to rewrite the story. They would be the ones to build a world where gender was not a cage, where the human heart was free to soar.",
            "The air hung thick and cold. They said it wasn't legal, not really. Decriminalized, they called it. A slap on the wrist, a fine, not the cold steel of the cage. But the fear, the shadow of it, lingered. The marks it left, on your soul, on your chances. It lingered in the whispers, in the eyes of men, in the silence between words.  \n\nThey said it freed up money. Money for schools, for the hungry, for the sick. Money they could use to mend the cracks in this broken world. But the cracks ran deep. The heart of the matter, they said, was the money.\n\nSome places, the old ways held tight. Stubborn, clinging to the fear. But others, they saw the light. Denver, they called it. A place where the wind carried whispers of change, where the old ways crumbled in the face of a new dawn.\n\nMaybe, he thought, it wasn't about the money. Maybe it was about the change. The way it seeped into the air, the way it shifted the ground beneath your feet. The way it made you question everything you thought you knew.\n\nHe saw it in the faces of the young, the way their eyes lit up with a dangerous hope. They weren't afraid of the shadows. They wanted to dance in them.\n\nBut the old ways, they cast a long shadow. A shadow that stretched across the years, across generations. A shadow that whispered of danger, of loss, of a world that could never be fully reclaimed.\n\nHe remembered the lake, the stillness of the water, the smell of pine needles and damp earth. The slow, rhythmic stroke of the oars, the creaking of the boat. His uncle's pipe, the smoke curling in the air. A moment of perfect peace, a memory etched in the heart of the past.\n\nBut the world moved on. The shadows lengthened. And the wind carried a new kind of smoke.",
            "The thing is, yeah, they do things a certain way. Old ways. Been doing 'em for a spell.  Rooted, you know? But the world ain't what it was. Times change. Gotta bend a little.  \n\nThey say church every week, gotta follow the book.  Strict, that's for sure.  And they look down on folks who don't fit the mold.  Folks who ain't perfect. Folks who pray to a different God.  \n\nLike my old man.  Episcopalian.  My Ma, Catholic.  Wouldn't marry them in the Church.  Said it was against the rules.  Hypocrisy, I tell ya.  Love your neighbor, they say. But turn your back on 'em if they ain't one of them. \n\nIt's like the rules are one thing, and the way they live another.  Old ways dying hard, that's for sure.\n\nNow, about those priests...\n\nThey say letting 'em marry would fix things.  Make 'em better men.  But that ain't the root of the problem, is it?  Some folks, they got a sickness.  Don't matter if they got a wife or not.  They gonna do what they gonna do.\n\nIt ain't about marriage, it's about the darkness inside.",
            "The thing is, the way things stand now, it's a knot you can't untie. Church and state, marriage, it's all tangled up.  One hand reaching for the other, grabbing hold, and you can't say if one's right or wrong.  It's a hard sort of question, see?  Something as close as that,  it cuts both ways. \n\nWhat's marriage anyway?  Government business or something else?   If it's a sacrament, shouldn't the church be the one to decide? Like baptism, it's a matter of faith.  No tax breaks, no special treatment from the state. Just two souls bound together. \n\nBut if it's just two people, why the fuss? Why not call it a civil union?  What difference does it make? It's a joining, a commitment. \n\nAnd this whole business with gay marriage... it's like they're trying to draw lines in the sand.  Two souls, just like any other, wanting to join.  Why deny them that? \n\nMaybe if all the states could see eye to eye, they could make it a law.  But a constitutional amendment to ban it? That's just wrong.  The Constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.  It's not some great moral crisis.  It's just love, plain and simple.\n\n\nNo.  An amendment? That's just too much.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and ash. He shifted the weight of the world on his shoulders, a world that seemed to tilt on its axis, forever teetering between light and dark.  The question, it coiled in his gut like a snake, cold and insistent. It slithered through his mind, leaving a trail of unease.  Homosexuality. A word that tasted like brimstone in his mouth.  \n\nHe’d been raised in the shadow of a steeple, bathed in the glow of Sunday sermons.  But the world outside, the world he’d come to know, it was a tangled mess of contradictions. He had friends, bright souls with laughter in their eyes, who walked a path different from his own. A path that led them to solace in each other’s arms, a love that burned with a fierce, undeniable light.\n\nThe law, it was a tangled web spun by men with hands stained with hypocrisy. Should the weight of their judgment, their fear, dictate the course of another’s life? He didn’t have the answers, not the kind that would satisfy the searching in his soul. But he knew this:  \n\nLove, it was a river, ever flowing, ever changing. To try to dam it, to confine it within the rigid banks of man-made laws, was to invite catastrophe.\n\nThe states, they were the building blocks of this nation, each a microcosm of its own desires, its own demons.  Some, they held fast to the old ways, their hearts hardened by tradition. Others, they embraced the new, their souls open to the possibility of change.\n\nHe wasn’t a man of power, not a king nor a congressman. But he knew this:  A man’s heart, it belonged to him alone. To love, to choose, to find solace in another’s embrace, these were the truest expressions of his freedom.  And if the law could not, or would not, protect that freedom, then it was a law that had lost its way.",
            "The boy huddled close, his breath a thin hiss in the cold.  \"We going to die?\" he asked. The question hung in the air, a bone sliver in the gray silence.\n\nThe man looked at him, the firelight catching the hard angles of his face. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice a rasp. \"Sometime. But not now.\"\n\nThe boy shivered. \"We still going south?\"\n\n\"Yes. We'll be warm.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, a small sound lost in the wind. He stared into the flames, his eyes dark and unblinking.  The man watched him, a cold knot in his gut.  He knew the boy was too young to understand, too young to grasp the bleak weight of their journey.\n\nOutside, the wind howled a mournful song, rattling the bones of the abandoned shack. The world was a canvas of ash and shadow, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay. They had been traveling for weeks, ever since the city had fallen. Since the fire had come.  \n\nHe had seen things, things that would stain his soul. Things he could never unsee. But the boy, he was still innocent. Still held onto a sliver of hope. The man wouldn't allow that hope to be extinguished. He would protect it, even if it meant sacrificing everything else.\n\nHe pulled his threadbare cloak tighter around him, the worn fabric offering little comfort against the cold. The fire sputtered, sending a shower of sparks into the night. He reached out and took the boy's hand, feeling the small, trembling fingers clutch at his own.\n\n\"Do you think God sees us?\" the boy asked.\n\nThe man squeezed his hand, his gaze fixed on the dancing flames. \"He sees everything,\" he said, his voice barely a whisper.",
            "The dust of the world clung to everything. The air itself tasted like ash. The war. It had begun in the gut, a knot of rage after the towers fell.  A rising tide of vengeance. He'd been ready to go, to drown the hatred in blood.  But the blood hadn't washed it clean.  Just stained it deeper.\n\nHe'd seen the truth in the long nights, the hollow echoes of reason lost in the howling wind. They went in blind, fists clenched, hearts aflame. No plan, no map. Just a thirst for retribution.  \n\nAnd the wasteland they'd carved out, it mirrored the emptiness inside. The people there, they were caught in a different kind of war, a war without rules, without reason. A war fought with the tools of survival.\n\nHe'd seen their faces, the weary eyes, the hard lines etched deep by a kind of hunger that couldn't be appeased. They were fighting for scraps, for a sliver of hope in a world gone mad.  And they saw him, a stranger, a bringer of his own kind of chaos.\n\nThey were not savages, not monsters. Just men and women trying to survive in a world where survival meant fighting.\n\nHe'd lost the fire in his belly, replaced by a cold, gnawing understanding. The war had birthed a monster, and they were all feeding it.  He had no answers, only the ashes of what had been.  Only the knowledge that they should have stayed away."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. It needs changing. Its grip loosens, its flock scattering. Too much clinging to the old ways.  The things they say, they hang like a shroud over the world. Gay marriage. Abortion. Birth control.  The Church stands firm, an island in a sea of shifting sands. Their words, they cut like stones against the tide. \n\nThey say it's the way it's always been, that the world is wrong. But the world keeps turning. People are different now. They yearn for something more, something that doesn't feel like a prison of stone.\n\nThe old men in their robes, they clutch their scriptures like shields. They speak of sin and damnation, but the young, they hear a different song. The song of freedom, of acceptance, of a world where love isn't a battleground. \n\nA world where a man can love another man and call it holy, where a woman can choose her own path, where a body is not owned by doctrine.\n\nThe Church, it whispers of eternity. But what good is eternity if it's built on a foundation of fear?",
            "The word hung in the air, a question mark heavy with the dust of a dying sun. \"Gay marriage.\" He shifted his weight, the words catching in his throat like a bone. The air was thick with the unspoken, the weight of a world where shadows fell long and choices felt like stones dropped into a well.\n\nHe knew some folks, folks who lived lives woven tight with the threads of their beliefs, who'd say it was wrong. A sin, they'd murmur, a stain on the fabric of things.  But he'd seen the fire in a man's eyes when he talked of the woman he loved, the way his hand trembled when he held hers. He'd seen the solace in a couple's embrace, the quiet strength in their shared gaze. Love, he thought, wasn't a choice. It was a wildfire, burning with a fierce and untamed light.\n\nHe thought of the boy he knew, the one with the bright eyes and the laughter that rang like chimes in the wind. A boy who loved his grandpa, loved the feel of the sun on his face, loved the stories of long ago. He thought of how unfair it would be to deny that boy the same chance at happiness, the same right to love and be loved.\n\nHe couldn't say he'd wrestled with the words, hadn't spent nights pondering the scriptures or arguing with the shadows in his mind. But he knew this: love wasn't a thing to be measured, weighed, or controlled. It was a force of nature, a wild river carving its own path. And if a river chose to flow in a direction different from the one expected, should it be dammed or diverted?\n\nHe thought of the federal government, its vast and unknowable reach, its hands always reaching, always grasping. He thought of its pronouncements, its laws, its attempts to shape the world into its own image. And he wondered if love, that untamed, unyielding force, could ever truly be contained.",
            "The air hung thick and low, a shroud over the words. \"Gay marriage,\" he rasped, the word tasting like ash on his tongue. \"Seems like there ain't no good reason not to.\"\n\nHis voice was a whisper against the wind, a frail thing against the silence of the empty field. He shifted his weight, the bones of his old boots crunching in the dust.\n\n\"Folks say it's a threat,\" he went on, his voice barely audible. \"To the family. But it ain't the same, is it? Two sides of a coin, maybe. But the face changes.\"\n\nHe squinted at the horizon, where the sun bled into the dying light. A ragged line of blood against the gray. \"Rights, those are what it boils down to. Property, healthcare... if you're with someone, you should be with them, no matter what.\"\n\nHe paused, a tremor running through his hands. \"They say it's against God's will. But what God? Whose God? The one who sits in judgment from a pulpit or the one that whispers in the wind? You can't legislate faith, not when faith itself is a whisper.\"\n\nHis gaze drifted to the distant city, a hulking silhouette against the fading light. \"There's children involved, too. They need their parents, both of them. Not just the ones who happen to bleed the same.\"\n\nHe looked back at the empty field, the wind whipping his hair. \"This ain't about morality,\" he said, his voice barely a sigh. \"It's about love, about family, about human decency. Ain't that what matters? Ain't that what's worth fighting for?\"",
            "The air in the pharmacy hung thick with the smell of disinfectant and the ghosts of a thousand ailments. He had seen the shadows of death in those aisles, glimpsed them in the pale eyes of the dying and the chalky dust of their bones. And yet, the question before him was not of life or death but of a green, leafy thing, a weed that whispered promises of solace and oblivion.\n\n\"Just because it's outlawed,\" he said, his voice rasping like a rusty hinge, \"doesn't make it poison.\" He paused, the words catching in the dry air. \"The law's a fickle mistress, blind to truth and swayed by whispers.\" \n\nHe saw the unease in the other man's eyes, the flicker of judgment. \"There are things,\" he continued, \"things the law keeps locked away, things deemed dangerous, but used by those who know better. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets - names whispered in darkened rooms, pills dispensed with measured caution. Yet they ease pain, offer a reprieve from the world's harsh edges.\"\n\nHe let the silence settle, thick and heavy, then leaned forward. \"Marijuana. It's not a monster, not a demon to be feared. It's a whisper in the wind, a balm for the weary soul. To deny its potential, to cling to ignorance, that's the real crime.\"\n\nHe saw the other man's hesitation, the battle being waged in his gaze. \"A gradual easing,\" he offered, \"a lifting of the veil, not a sudden flood. Let people see its face, understand its nature. Then, perhaps, they'll use it wisely, not as a crutch, but as a tool.\"\n\nHe knew the fight was not won, not yet. But he'd planted a seed, a sliver of doubt in the sterile soil of fear. Maybe, just maybe, it would grow.",
            "The church, she's changed some. Evolved, I guess. Not the iron fist it used to be. When I was a child, Sundays meant a dress, shoes, purse - the whole shebang. Matching, of course. Private school, all the friends there, every week the same ritual. Now?  They've got this thing, a teenager mass. Thirty minutes flat.  Folks come straight from the beach, sand still in their hair, kids running late. Jeans, khakis - nobody's in their Sunday best anymore. Not even at the morning service, where I used to be all dressed up.  It's a different world in there now. \n\nThe truth is, that's all I know. The church I grew up in, the one with the stained glass and the smell of incense. Not the politics, not the whispers. Just the pews and the hymns.  Those things, they're the shadow of what else might be out there.\n\nAs for those stories, the ones about the priests... you can't blame the robes, the vows.  There are married men who do those things, too. It's a sickness, a darkness inside. You can't legislate against that. If a man's drawn to that kind of darkness, a wedding ring won't stop it.\n\nThere are other paths, other faiths where a man can be a man and a priest.  Didn't they have that on some show? Seventh Heaven, something like that? A minister, married, with kids.  Maybe that's where they belong, those who want both.",
            "The ash hung heavy, a shroud over everything. The air itself tasted of it, a metallic tang on the tongue.  He thought of the day, September eleventh, the way the world had cracked open and spilled its guts. A lie then, a lie now. Bin Laden, weapons of mass destruction, all smoke and mirrors. They’d gone in believing, or pretended to. The man gazed at the boy, at the innocence etched in his young face, and a bitter taste rose in his throat. He’d seen the truth in Powell’s eyes, the flicker of doubt even as he spun the web of deceit. Malfeasance. A word fit for a king, but a king who’d traded his crown for a shroud of lies.\n\nThe Constitution, twisted and contorted, a broken promise. The Bush men, father and son, fueled by vengeance and the scent of oil. War, a hungry beast, always wanting more.\n\nHe thought of the lake, a mirror reflecting the sky, the air thick with the smell of pine and rot. The oars, a steady rhythm, the only sound. His uncle, pipe clenched between his teeth, a silhouette against the dying light. A day carved in memory, a day before the world went mad.\n\nNow, the country bled, a slow, agonizing death. The boy would grow up knowing only the taste of ash. The UN, a hollow shell, the coalition a patchwork of broken promises.  The Parliament, a stage for the play of shadows, the puppet masters pulling the strings. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, adrift in a sea of chaos. Sadr, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, his fangs bared.\n\nHe closed his eyes, saw the boy’s face, the question in his eyes. Could he answer it? Could he explain the madness, the betrayal, the endless cycle of violence?\n\nThe world was broken. And he didn’t know how to fix it.",
            "The boy sat hunched, the plastic tarp a ragged shroud against the damp.  He spoke in a voice thin as a sparrow's call. \"How I feel about the war in Iraq.\" His words hung in the air, catching on the silence like smoke.\n\n\"Mmhmm,\" I said, my gaze fixed on the ash-streaked road that stretched before us, leading into the grayness.  \n\n\"Just talk into it?\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"Ok, cool.\"\n\nHe hesitated, his eyes fixed on the worn leather of his worn shoes. \"Um, at this point I feel it's kind of pointless. I mean, it ain't even a real war, not declared, you know?\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"And it feels like it was just a way to get back at Iraq, like payback for 9/11. You know, they figured that's who did it.\" He kicked at a loose stone, sending it skittering across the barren ground. \"I don't know the big picture, the details. But it feels like we're stuck there now, trying to build democracy. To make it another America. Like we're taking their land and their oil.\" He shook his head, the movement sluggish, weary. \"But it ain't right. It's making everyone angry.\"\n\nHe fell silent, his gaze drawn to the horizon where the sky bled into the dust. \"You forget things, don't you?\" he said finally, his voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, my voice rough. \"You forget what you want to remember, and remember what you want to forget.\"\n\n\nHe looked up at me, his eyes filled with a darkness that belied his years. \"What if it never ends?\" he asked, his voice trembling. \"What if we keep going back and forth, fighting, trying to make it something it's not?\"\n\nI had no answer for him. Only the wind, sighing through the ashes, a constant, mournful dirge.",
            "The air hung thick with the smell of dust and ashes. The man sat hunched in the shade of a bleached oak, its branches skeletal against the gray sky. His words were dry as the land itself, rasping out like the wind through dead leaves.\n\n\"It ain't right,\" he said, his voice a low rumble. \"Not right for the government to push its will on what the Lord's house should stand for. The Constitution, it says clear as day, separation of church and state. They try to tangle them up, they're going against what's been set down, what's carved in stone.\"\n\nHe spat a mouthful of tobacco juice onto the parched ground.\n\n\"They try to make it law, they're choosing one church's creed over another. The Catholics, the Christians, most of 'em, they're against it. But in some of those fancy cities, Boston, they're different. But that ain't the point. It ain't the government's place to decide what's right and wrong for souls.\" \n\nHe looked up at the endless expanse of sky, a bruised canvas of gray and blue.\n\n\"Separation, that's what it's all about. Tolerance. They want to change it, they're going against what the founders built. It ain't about restricting the people, it's about restricting the church. Ain't right.\"\n\nHe took a long drag from his cigarette, the ember glowing like a malevolent eye in the gloom.\n\n\"The government, they shouldn't be sniffing around this at all. The churches, they should be left to their own ways. This ain't about the economy or progress, it's about the soul. And the soul, that's a private affair.\" \n\nHe crushed the cigarette under his boot heel, the red glow fading into the dust.",
            "The air in Iraq hung thick, a shroud of dust and ash settling over everything like a bad memory. The government back home, they hadn't been straight with us, not about why we were there. 9/11, they said. A link to the terrorists. But it felt different, a lie whispered in the wind, a phantom echo of something else. They'd used our anger, our fear, to push us into this mess. 2003, the year the bombs fell, the year the world changed. \n\nWar. I ain't for it, never have been. A preemptive strike? That's just a fancy word for a fistfight before the other guy even throws a punch. Vietnam, they should've learned then. Same mistakes, same hollow victories.\n\nAmerican boys dying, good boys, for what? Just to rip out the heart of a country, leave it bleeding and broken. They talked about democracy, about planting new seeds, but they weren't prepared for the weeds that would grow, the ghosts that would rise from the dirt.  \n\nChaos, that's what they left behind. A vacuum, a power vacuum, sucking in the darkness. And we, we were the ones left to pick up the pieces.\n\nI remember the lake, years ago. My uncle, his straw hat pulled low, his pipe clenched between his teeth. We'd go out there for firewood, the air cold and sharp.  He'd tell me stories, about the old days, about the world before the darkness. He'd say, \"Some things you just can't control, son. The wind, the rain, the tide.\"\n\nBut the war, that wasn't something we couldn't control. It was us. We made it, and now we're stuck with it, like a stain on our souls.\n\nWe're still there, even now.  They talk about peace, about a new beginning, but the air is still thick with dust and ash. And the ghosts, they're still haunting us.",
            "The world, he thought, was gray. Ash-colored, like the bones of some long dead thing. And the bones, they knew. They knew the weight of the world, the burden of it. They knew the slow, relentless push of time. Same as the boy. Same as him.  \n\nHe believed in the rightness of it. This thing, this love, this union. It wasn't a choice, not in the way a man might choose to wear a hat or a coat. This was deeper, woven into the fabric of a man's being. As sure as the sun rose and set, as sure as the wind whispered through the trees.  \n\nHe'd seen it in his own neighborhood, in the quiet corners, the shared laughter, the unspoken understanding. Two men, two women, the same as any other couple, walking their dogs, sharing a meal, their lives a testament to something primal, something ancient.\n\nPolitics, he thought, were shadows. They danced and gestured, but they held no real power. This was a matter of the heart, a matter of the soul.  \n\nThey say it's a choice, they say it's a phase. But the boy, he knew better. He felt it too, the pull, the ache, the yearning. It was in his blood, in his bones.\n\nAnd God, he thought, God had a way of turning the world upside down. He'd seen it. He'd lived it. The world was full of shadows, but there were glimmers of light too. He held onto those glimmers, those fragile sparks of hope, like a man clinging to a raft in a storm.\n\nHe wouldn't let them extinguish the fire in his soul. Not while there was breath left in his body. Not while the boy still held his hand.",
            "The road stretched out like a vein of ash across the gutted landscape. Empty.  Sun a pale disc in the gray sky, barely piercing the dust.  He pushed the cart, the boy beside him, their shadows long and skeletal in the dust.  \n\n\"You think anyone else is out there?\" the boy asked. His voice thin, a whisper against the wind.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said. \"Maybe not.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence broken only by the scrape of the cart wheels on the cracked asphalt.  \n\n\"What if we were the only ones left?\" the boy asked, his eyes wide with a fear he tried to hide.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his face stained with dust, the lines around his eyes deep and etched. \"Then we'd have to take care of each other,\" he said.  \"That's all there is.\"\n\nThey stopped at the edge of a town, skeletal buildings rising from the ash like bleached bones.  Cars lay overturned, their metal hulls twisted and broken.  A silence hung over the place, thick and suffocating.\n\n\"It's like a graveyard,\" the boy murmured.\n\n\"Everything dies,\" he said, his voice rough. \"Even words. Even memories.\"\n\nThey walked through the streets, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay.  He felt a chill, not from the cold, but from the emptiness. The boy clung to his hand, his small fingers cold and clammy.\n\nThey found a house, its windows boarded up, its roof sagging.  He pushed open the door, the hinges groaning in protest. Inside, the air was stale and thick with the smell of dust and dampness.\n\n\"Someone lived here,\" the boy whispered, his voice echoing in the emptiness.\n\nHe nodded. \"Yes,\" he said. \"But they're gone now. Just like everyone else.\" \n\nThey sat down on the floor, the boy's head resting against his side.  He pulled the boy closer, trying to shield him from the cold, from the emptiness.\n\n\"Do you think there's still good in the world?\" the boy asked, his voice barely audible.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, the question hanging in the air between them.  He didn't know the answer.  He had seen too much darkness, too much pain.\n\nHe closed his eyes, trying to find a flicker of hope in the ashes. \"Maybe,\" he said, his voice a whisper. \"Maybe.\"",
            "The war. It stretched on, a festering wound. A purpose once clear, a noble aim to bring democracy to a land choked by tyranny.  But the light had dimmed. The reasons, once etched in righteousness, had blurred into something indistinct, something like a thirst for power, a hunger to prove dominion. The echoes of a father’s old quarrels, shadows cast by a past that lingered like smoke, clung to the edges of this manufactured conflict. \n\nWas it a just cause then? To free a people from shackles, to offer them the promise of a voice? Perhaps. But the years had bled away the purity. The initial blows, swift and decisive, had spoken volumes.  But the brutal dance of war continued, a macabre waltz with death, fueled by a need to conquer, to dominate. \n\nThe land itself seemed to wither under the weight of this protracted struggle. The coffers emptied, the blood spilled, the spirit broken.  A nation bled while its own children starved. The streets of its cities echoed with the cries of the forgotten, the silent pleas of those left behind. Billions diverted from schools and hospitals, from bridges and roads, poured into the maw of war, a bottomless pit of destruction.\n\nThere comes a point, he thought, when a people must stand on their own. When a nation must learn to defend its own destiny.  The time had come to withdraw, to sever the umbilical cord that bound them to this quagmire.  Let them face their demons, their own internal struggles.  Let them rise or fall by their own choices.",
            "The boy's voice, thin and reedy as a wind through the bone trees. \"Can I ask a question?\" \n\nHe turned from the cracked window, the gray light outside a reflection of the ash inside. \"Sure.\" \n\n\"About that thing... with the internet.\"\n\nHe knew. He could feel the boy's eyes on him, probing, wary. \"Maybe you shouldn't. Some things are best left unsaid.\"\n\n\"But someone saw something. And stopped it. Is that bad?\"\n\nHe leaned back, the rusted springs of the chair groaning. \"The world is full of shadows. Some places you don't want to look too hard.\"\n\nThe boy persisted. \"But if someone saw something bad... and stopped it... is that bad?\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, his face pale and drawn, etched with the same dust that clung to everything in this place.\n\n\"The internet,\" he said, \"is a mirror. And sometimes the things it shows are not meant for human eyes. Some things are better left buried.\"\n\nThe boy was silent. His eyes, dark and watchful, like those of a wild creature.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" he whispered, finally. \"It feels like...\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Like the bad things are always coming. Like we're running from them.\" \n\nHe reached out and touched the boy's shoulder, the flesh cold and thin beneath his hand.\n\n\"We are,\" he said, his voice hoarse. \"But we run together.\"",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, choked with the dust of a thousand broken promises. \"Hmm,\" he rasped, the sound catching in his throat like a bird with a broken wing. \"Um,\" he stumbled, words like stones tumbling down a dry gulch. \"We only have this, and then one more time about the war.  Um, yeah. I mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it, you know. I hate to say it, I hate to join that chorus of voices, the ones that bleat 'I was against it from the start.' Um, I was, but it's not about that anymore. The truth sits heavy now, a stone in the gut –  the consensus, even amidst the whispering halls of power, was that it was a fool's errand. A bad idea.\"  \n\nHe paused, letting the silence stretch, a shroud over the words unspoken. \"The polls are there, you see. United States, Iraq, the world. Seventy-five, eighty percent. They say it was a mistake. Eighty percent of the Iraqis themselves, seventy percent of the men sent to fight, they say it, too.  Pull out, they say. Within the year.  It's been a disaster, from the first breath of that poisoned wind. A festering wound, and now the healing, the pulling back, is another wound in waiting.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he sighed, the sound a crack in the dry earth. \"There's no easy way out in that tangled desert. It's a clash, you see? A storm of cultures, a gulf too wide to bridge. The administration, they don't understand. They think they can force their light on a land that doesn't want it. Democracy, a seed sown in barren ground, choked by the dust of difference. Yes, Saddam was a monster, but was this the answer? To tear down a tyrant and build a phantom in its place?\"\n\nHe looked away, his gaze lost in the dust devils dancing across the wasteland of his words. \" Just quicksand, all of it.  I don't know what to say.  There's no reason to stay.  They'll have their justifications, their carefully crafted narratives, but they're empty words.  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, a quarter say now.  We're trying to help them, they tell us to leave. Maybe they know better. Maybe they know what's best for them.\"   He thought of the exodus, a slow, agonizing crawl back into the darkness. \"Gradual, maybe. A year, a little longer, but no more.  We can't be the saviors, not anymore. We're just a stain on the land.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the stink of ash and memory. He knew, yes, knew it in the bone-deep chill that settled on him like a shroud. Gendered judgment, it was a hunger that gnawed at the belly of the world, a sickness that festered in the marrow. Women, men, bound by the same chains, each to their own appointed role. \n\nHe'd seen it in the way the city, a skeletal carcass of concrete and steel, still held its breath, waiting for the day when men would rise again to claim it, to rebuild the monuments of their own making. The women, they lingered in the shadows, ghosts in dresses of dust, their whispers lost on the wind.  \n\nIt wasn't just the women, though.  He saw it in the hard eyes of the men who worked the empty fields, their calloused hands clutching at the tattered remnants of pride. The men who stayed home, tending to the ashes of broken dreams, their spirits withered like the crops.\n\nThey all wore the scars, these men and women, the marks of a world that refused to let them be whole. And the truth was, the world saw them only in fragments, a shattered reflection of what it wished them to be. A woman in a chair, a man with calloused hands, a boy with a book. Nothing more.\n\nHe thought of the young ones, the children who were still learning the language of this broken world. They would carry the weight of these judgments, these invisible shackles, until they, too, learned to wear the masks of conformity.  \n\nBut he saw a flicker of hope in their eyes, a defiant spark that refused to be extinguished. They were the seeds of change, waiting to bloom in the ashes of the old world. They would be the ones to break the chains, to rewrite the story. They would be the ones to build a world where gender was not a cage, where the human heart was free to soar.",
            "The air hung thick and cold. They said it wasn't legal, not really. Decriminalized, they called it. A slap on the wrist, a fine, not the cold steel of the cage. But the fear, the shadow of it, lingered. The marks it left, on your soul, on your chances. It lingered in the whispers, in the eyes of men, in the silence between words.  \n\nThey said it freed up money. Money for schools, for the hungry, for the sick. Money they could use to mend the cracks in this broken world. But the cracks ran deep. The heart of the matter, they said, was the money.\n\nSome places, the old ways held tight. Stubborn, clinging to the fear. But others, they saw the light. Denver, they called it. A place where the wind carried whispers of change, where the old ways crumbled in the face of a new dawn.\n\nMaybe, he thought, it wasn't about the money. Maybe it was about the change. The way it seeped into the air, the way it shifted the ground beneath your feet. The way it made you question everything you thought you knew.\n\nHe saw it in the faces of the young, the way their eyes lit up with a dangerous hope. They weren't afraid of the shadows. They wanted to dance in them.\n\nBut the old ways, they cast a long shadow. A shadow that stretched across the years, across generations. A shadow that whispered of danger, of loss, of a world that could never be fully reclaimed.\n\nHe remembered the lake, the stillness of the water, the smell of pine needles and damp earth. The slow, rhythmic stroke of the oars, the creaking of the boat. His uncle's pipe, the smoke curling in the air. A moment of perfect peace, a memory etched in the heart of the past.\n\nBut the world moved on. The shadows lengthened. And the wind carried a new kind of smoke.",
            "The thing is, yeah, they do things a certain way. Old ways. Been doing 'em for a spell.  Rooted, you know? But the world ain't what it was. Times change. Gotta bend a little.  \n\nThey say church every week, gotta follow the book.  Strict, that's for sure.  And they look down on folks who don't fit the mold.  Folks who ain't perfect. Folks who pray to a different God.  \n\nLike my old man.  Episcopalian.  My Ma, Catholic.  Wouldn't marry them in the Church.  Said it was against the rules.  Hypocrisy, I tell ya.  Love your neighbor, they say. But turn your back on 'em if they ain't one of them. \n\nIt's like the rules are one thing, and the way they live another.  Old ways dying hard, that's for sure.\n\nNow, about those priests...\n\nThey say letting 'em marry would fix things.  Make 'em better men.  But that ain't the root of the problem, is it?  Some folks, they got a sickness.  Don't matter if they got a wife or not.  They gonna do what they gonna do.\n\nIt ain't about marriage, it's about the darkness inside.",
            "The thing is, the way things stand now, it's a knot you can't untie. Church and state, marriage, it's all tangled up.  One hand reaching for the other, grabbing hold, and you can't say if one's right or wrong.  It's a hard sort of question, see?  Something as close as that,  it cuts both ways. \n\nWhat's marriage anyway?  Government business or something else?   If it's a sacrament, shouldn't the church be the one to decide? Like baptism, it's a matter of faith.  No tax breaks, no special treatment from the state. Just two souls bound together. \n\nBut if it's just two people, why the fuss? Why not call it a civil union?  What difference does it make? It's a joining, a commitment. \n\nAnd this whole business with gay marriage... it's like they're trying to draw lines in the sand.  Two souls, just like any other, wanting to join.  Why deny them that? \n\nMaybe if all the states could see eye to eye, they could make it a law.  But a constitutional amendment to ban it? That's just wrong.  The Constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.  It's not some great moral crisis.  It's just love, plain and simple.\n\n\nNo.  An amendment? That's just too much.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and ash. He shifted the weight of the world on his shoulders, a world that seemed to tilt on its axis, forever teetering between light and dark.  The question, it coiled in his gut like a snake, cold and insistent. It slithered through his mind, leaving a trail of unease.  Homosexuality. A word that tasted like brimstone in his mouth.  \n\nHe’d been raised in the shadow of a steeple, bathed in the glow of Sunday sermons.  But the world outside, the world he’d come to know, it was a tangled mess of contradictions. He had friends, bright souls with laughter in their eyes, who walked a path different from his own. A path that led them to solace in each other’s arms, a love that burned with a fierce, undeniable light.\n\nThe law, it was a tangled web spun by men with hands stained with hypocrisy. Should the weight of their judgment, their fear, dictate the course of another’s life? He didn’t have the answers, not the kind that would satisfy the searching in his soul. But he knew this:  \n\nLove, it was a river, ever flowing, ever changing. To try to dam it, to confine it within the rigid banks of man-made laws, was to invite catastrophe.\n\nThe states, they were the building blocks of this nation, each a microcosm of its own desires, its own demons.  Some, they held fast to the old ways, their hearts hardened by tradition. Others, they embraced the new, their souls open to the possibility of change.\n\nHe wasn’t a man of power, not a king nor a congressman. But he knew this:  A man’s heart, it belonged to him alone. To love, to choose, to find solace in another’s embrace, these were the truest expressions of his freedom.  And if the law could not, or would not, protect that freedom, then it was a law that had lost its way.",
            "The boy huddled close, his breath a thin hiss in the cold.  \"We going to die?\" he asked. The question hung in the air, a bone sliver in the gray silence.\n\nThe man looked at him, the firelight catching the hard angles of his face. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice a rasp. \"Sometime. But not now.\"\n\nThe boy shivered. \"We still going south?\"\n\n\"Yes. We'll be warm.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, a small sound lost in the wind. He stared into the flames, his eyes dark and unblinking.  The man watched him, a cold knot in his gut.  He knew the boy was too young to understand, too young to grasp the bleak weight of their journey.\n\nOutside, the wind howled a mournful song, rattling the bones of the abandoned shack. The world was a canvas of ash and shadow, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay. They had been traveling for weeks, ever since the city had fallen. Since the fire had come.  \n\nHe had seen things, things that would stain his soul. Things he could never unsee. But the boy, he was still innocent. Still held onto a sliver of hope. The man wouldn't allow that hope to be extinguished. He would protect it, even if it meant sacrificing everything else.\n\nHe pulled his threadbare cloak tighter around him, the worn fabric offering little comfort against the cold. The fire sputtered, sending a shower of sparks into the night. He reached out and took the boy's hand, feeling the small, trembling fingers clutch at his own.\n\n\"Do you think God sees us?\" the boy asked.\n\nThe man squeezed his hand, his gaze fixed on the dancing flames. \"He sees everything,\" he said, his voice barely a whisper.",
            "The dust of the world clung to everything. The air itself tasted like ash. The war. It had begun in the gut, a knot of rage after the towers fell.  A rising tide of vengeance. He'd been ready to go, to drown the hatred in blood.  But the blood hadn't washed it clean.  Just stained it deeper.\n\nHe'd seen the truth in the long nights, the hollow echoes of reason lost in the howling wind. They went in blind, fists clenched, hearts aflame. No plan, no map. Just a thirst for retribution.  \n\nAnd the wasteland they'd carved out, it mirrored the emptiness inside. The people there, they were caught in a different kind of war, a war without rules, without reason. A war fought with the tools of survival.\n\nHe'd seen their faces, the weary eyes, the hard lines etched deep by a kind of hunger that couldn't be appeased. They were fighting for scraps, for a sliver of hope in a world gone mad.  And they saw him, a stranger, a bringer of his own kind of chaos.\n\nThey were not savages, not monsters. Just men and women trying to survive in a world where survival meant fighting.\n\nHe'd lost the fire in his belly, replaced by a cold, gnawing understanding. The war had birthed a monster, and they were all feeding it.  He had no answers, only the ashes of what had been.  Only the knowledge that they should have stayed away."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, she needs changing. That much is clear. Their grip is loosening, a slow unraveling, and I reckon it's the old ways that are strangling them. The way they hold onto these things—gay marriage, abortion, birth control—it's like clutching onto rusted chains, dragging them further down. It’s a style of thinking that’s gone stale, forgotten the taste of the wind on a new day. \n\nThey cling to these ancient pronouncements, these lines in the sand drawn by men long gone.  But the world, it keeps turning. The river keeps flowing. And folks are waking up,  seeing the shadows lurking in those old stories. They're starting to drift away, seeking a place where they feel seen, where their own truths aren't met with judgment and scorn.\n\nThink of it, a life lived in the shadow of forbidden desires, of whispered secrets. A young heart yearning for love, but afraid to speak its name. A woman, her body a vessel denied its own autonomy.  They're not asking for much, just a voice, a place at the table. \n\nThe Church, it speaks of God's love, but where is that love in these pronouncements? Is it love that binds, that suffocates? Is it love that judges and condemns? \n\nThey talk of priests, men devoted to God. But isn't there devotion in the love of a family, the shared laughter, the tears shed together? Is a man's heart not capable of holding both God and the world?\n\nThey talk of what is right and wrong, but who are they to decide?  Whose whispers guide their pens, their pronouncements?  They stand on a mountain of stone, blind to the shifting sands below. They cling to their dogma, their rituals, their power, unaware that the world is moving on, leaving them behind in the dust.  Maybe, just maybe, it's time for them to open their eyes and see.",
            "The boy sat, chin resting on his knees, eyes bright with unshed tears. A question hung between them, heavy as the silence that pressed in from the sides. He looked up at the man, a question burning in his eyes. \"What’s wrong with them?\" he asked, voice barely a rasp.\n\nThe man shifted, tugging at the collar of his worn shirt.  His gaze drifted to the gray dust swirling outside, kicked up by a wind that tasted of ash and regret. \"It's not right,\" he finally said, his voice a low rumble. \"Not right at all.\" He looked back at the boy, his face drawn and hard. \"They try to say it’s a choice,\" he continued, \"like some sin you can just decide to leave behind. But it ain't that. You can't choose who you love, who you are.\"\n\nThe boy frowned, brow creased in confusion. \"But isn't that what love is? Choosing?\"\n\nThe man shook his head, a slow, weary motion. \"Love ain't a choice,\" he said, his voice a whisper against the wind. \"It's a thing that finds you, takes hold, and burrows deep inside. You can fight it, try to run, but it stays.\"\n\nHe reached out, his hand calloused and rough, and covered the boy's. \"Some folks,\" he said, \"they just don't understand. They fear what they don't know, what they can't control. They call it wrong, try to make it bad. But it ain't wrong, son. It's just...different.\"\n\nHe squeezed the boy's hand, a silent promise etched in the gesture. \"And different ain't always bad,\" he said, eyes filled with a weary hope. \"Sometimes, different is just...more.\"",
            "The road stretched before them, black and broken, a ribbon of ash in the dying light. The boy walked beside him, his shadow a thin wraith against the bone-colored dust.  \"Why can't folks just see it?\" the boy asked, his voice small in the vast emptiness. \n\nHe didn't answer. What was there to say? The world had gone quiet, choked by ash and the weight of silence.  They'd been walking for days, ever since the fire had come.  Every town, every village, reduced to smoldering skeletons.  Empty eyes staring up from the charred timbers, like the sockets of some great fallen beast. \n\nHe'd lost count of the days. The sun, a pale ghost behind the haze, offered no comfort. The nights were colder, gnawing at their insides.  \n\nThey came to a town, or what was left of it.  The wind whispered through the skeletal remains of buildings, carrying the scent of dust and decay. A rusted car lay overturned in the middle of the street, its shattered windshield like a vacant eye staring at the sky.\n\n\"Papa,\" the boy said, his voice tight. \"Do you think there's anyone else out here?\"\n\nHe looked at him, a flicker of something dark and ancient in his eyes. \"Maybe,\" he said. \"But it ain't a kind world anymore.\"\n\nThey pressed on, their footsteps echoing in the hollow silence.  They found an abandoned gas station, its pumps standing like crooked sentinels. The air was thick with the smell of gasoline, a phantom scent of a world that was gone.\n\nHe squeezed the boy's shoulder, a brief moment of connection in the vast emptiness. \"We'll find a place,\" he said, his voice rough with exhaustion. \"A place where it ain't so…\" He trailed off, unable to find the words.\n\nThe boy nodded, his eyes filled with a wisdom beyond his years.  \"We'll be alright,\" he said.\n\nHe didn't know if it was true. But he had to believe it. For the boy's sake, if nothing else.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the scent of stale medicine and disinfectant clinging to the walls. He spoke, his voice a low murmur in the quiet room. \"Just because something's outlawed,\" he said, \"doesn't mean it holds no good.\" \n\nHe paused, the silence stretching like a taut wire. \"You see, in this pharmacy,\" he continued, \"we deal with things the world calls 'dangerous.'  Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets - names whispered with fear, yet they ease pain, they mend broken bodies. People need these things.\" \n\nHe looked up, his eyes hard and unwavering. \"And what about this plant? This weed they call marijuana? Just because it's cast out, deemed evil, doesn't mean its uses are gone. It has its uses, its purpose. Denying it simply because of a stigma, well, that's folly.\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"Think about it. The fear, the whispers, they cloud the truth. Like alcohol, it can be abused.  But so can water.  It's not the thing itself, it's the mind that makes it poison.  We need to see it for what it is, for what it can do. Not what they tell us it is.\"\n\nHe sighed, the sound heavy with weariness. \"Gradual, that's the key.  Open the door, let the light in.  Let people see its worth, its potential.\" He paused, his gaze distant. \"Strip away the fear.  Then, maybe, just maybe, they'll use it with wisdom, with care.\"",
            "The church, she'd changed. It ain't the same as it was. Back when she was a girl, Sundays meant a dress, shoes, a purse - all matching, every damn Sunday.  Private school, and all the girls dressed the same, same faces, same small talk. Now? Mass is a blur. Thirty minutes tops. They call it \"teenager mass.\" Jeans, t-shirts, sand still clinging to sandals from the beach. Folks spilling in late, kids restless. Even the morning masses, the ones she used to dress up for, folks come in jeans and khakis now.  It's different. \n\nAs for the other things, the whispers, the shadows... she don't know the politics, the machinations of men in robes. But that's the church she knows. The one that's changed, gone casual. \n\nMaybe it's for the better. Maybe it's not.\n\n\n\nShe'd sat in the rowboat, a boy again, fishing with her uncle. His old straw hat, a black pipe always dangling from his teeth, a steady puff of smoke. They'd rowed across the lake, silent, except for the scrape of oars against water.  The air thick with the smell of pines and wet earth.  \n\nThose days, they were perfect. The kind that shape a life.\n\nThose days are gone.",
            "The air hung thick with the grime of it. The dust of lies. They’d told us it was different.  A war against terror, a crusade for freedom.  But the truth, the cold, hard truth, settled in the gut like ash.  They’d tied it to Bin Laden, to the ghosts of September, to phantom weapons.  A tapestry woven of deceit.  And the man at the helm, he spun the threads with a cold, practiced hand. \n\nPowell, even he – the man who stood before the world, brandishing the lies as truth – now whispers doubts.  A slow, creeping realization that the foundation was rotten.  But the damage was done.  The blood spilled. The lives consumed. A country broken.\n\nThey spoke of justice, of a new world order. But the stench of hypocrisy hung heavy in the air.  The Constitution, that sacred document, trampled underfoot.  They’d come for war, it seemed, with a hunger born of vengeance and a thirst for dominion.  The oil, a siren song, a whisper in the dark.\n\nAnd now, years later, the reckoning draws near.  A fragile peace hangs by a thread, a coalition cobbled together from the ashes of a broken land.  But who will fill the void?  Whose hands will grip the reins?  The ghosts of the past linger, the echoes of violence still resonate.  \n\nIraq bleeds, a canvas painted in shades of sorrow.  And the world watches, a silent observer to a tragedy of its own making.",
            "The air hung still and low, thick as dust.  The words caught in his throat, a dry rasp. He watched the boy, his face pale and drawn in the weak light filtering through the leaves. \n\n\"It's pointless,\" he finally said, the words tasting like ash on his tongue. \"A reckoning, that's what it is. Retribution. They figured it was them, them and their shadows. But who knows truth anymore? It's all gone to ash.\" \n\nHe spat on the ground, a black fleck against the gray dirt. \"Not a real war, not like they used to call them. Congress never said the word. But the guns, they speak a language of their own. A language of power and fear.\"\n\nHe pulled the boy closer, the child's thin frame a weight against his chest.  \"Democracy,\" he said, the word a bitter joke. \"A word tossed around like a useless trinket.  They think they can build it, mold it, like clay.  But a people's heart, it ain't so easily shaped.\"\n\n\"It's a trap,\" he whispered, his voice a low growl. \"A trap of oil and whispers, of promises made and broken. We stay, we bleed, we watch them bleed. And for what? To make it our own? To claim a piece of their dust?\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, his eyes dark and haunted. \"It's a wound that never heals, this thing. A sickness that festers. They'll learn, they'll understand, when the dust settles and the ghosts of the dead walk the streets. That this was never ours to take.\"",
            "The air hung heavy with the silence of things unsaid. The law, he thought, a web spun by men with hearts cold as stone.  To say it was wrong, to try and bind it with words on parchment, felt like a violation. The words themselves, \"separation of church and state,\" echoed in his mind, a hollow promise whispered on the wind.  Was it truly separation, or a delicate balance, a line drawn in the dust that could be erased by the weight of a man's conviction?\n\nThe churches, they should decide. Let them wrestle with their scriptures, with the weight of their own beliefs. To force his will upon them, to impose his own god upon them, felt like a betrayal of the very soul of this land.  It was a war, he thought, waged not with swords and fire, but with whispered prayers and unspoken fears.\n\nThe man spoke of amendments, of changing the very fabric of the nation.  But the Constitution, it was already written. The ink, it had dried long ago. To alter it now, to bend it to his will, felt like a desecration.\n\nHe thought of the old country, the land of his ancestors.  A place where the church held sway, where the whispers of the priests were law.  A place where dissent was met with silence, and silence was a prison.  He had come here, seeking refuge, seeking a place where the soul could breathe free.  And now, this.  This attempt to shackle the spirit, to bind it to the whims of men.\n\nNo, he thought.  Let the churches decide. Let them fight their battles in the quiet corners of their sanctuaries. But keep the government out of it.  For in the end, it was not the laws that mattered, but the hearts of men.   And those hearts, he believed, were best left untamed.",
            "The dust hung low, a gray shroud over the skeletal trees. The air itself tasted of ash. The war in Iraq. It started with a lie, a whisper of connection to those dark days in September, a phantom pain they tried to stitch to their own anger. A wound that wasn't theirs, yet they bled for it. 2003, the year the world tilted on its axis.  \n\nThey called it a preemptive strike, a necessary evil. Me, I knew better. War isn't a surgical incision, it's a mauling, a tearing apart of everything in its path. I've seen it, felt its poisoned breath on my skin.  Just like Vietnam, a hollow victory, a quagmire of blood and broken promises. \n\nThey thought they could simply pick a new king, install their own kind of order.  They didn't understand. It's not that simple. You can't stitch democracy onto a land steeped in ancient grievances, in the bitter dust of generations lost. The echoes of their failures in Vietnam, they clung to them like ghosts.\n\nThey said it would be quick, a surge and then a withdrawal. A swift tide, in and out, leaving behind a cleansed shore. But the tide turned, the water receded, leaving behind a wasteland.  \n\nThe bodies piled up, young men, sons, husbands, fathers, all for a lie, all for a promise that withered on the wind. And the people, the ones they swore to liberate, they became the enemy.  \n\nNo, it wasn't a glorious crusade. It was a slow, burning hell, fueled by greed and fear, by the insatiable hunger for power. And the ghosts, the ghosts of those lost, they whisper in the wind. They whisper of a land forever scarred, of promises broken, of a war that never truly ended.",
            "The words caught in his throat, a knot of heat and ash.  He cleared it, raspy. \"I'm... I'm for it. Always have been.\" He fumbled for the right words, the words that wouldn't betray the conviction that bloomed in his chest. \"It's a matter of... choice. It's in the blood, see? Not some damn social fad. You can't legislate desire, can't legislate who a man loves.\"\n\nHe looked out across the barren landscape, a wasteland of dust and broken dreams. \"To take that away, to deny them the same rights... it's inhumane. Like watching a bird with a clipped wing, forced to crawl.\"\n\nHe thought of the families on his street, the ones who lived in the shadow of what they couldn't have. \"Just regular folks, trying to live their lives. Walking their dogs, laughing in the sun. Same as anyone else.\"  \n\nHe felt the anger rise, hot and bitter. \"Bush, playing God... twisting the meaning of marriage to fit his own damn agenda. It's a personal thing, a matter between two souls. Not some holy relic for the state to claim.\"\n\nThe silence stretched, heavy and oppressive. He tried to find the words again, to articulate the truth that burned in his gut. \"Science is catching up. They're finding out, proving it... this isn't a choice. It's a part of who you are, wired into your very being.\" He paused, his voice raw. \"You can't un-love someone, just like you can't un-see the sky.\"",
            "The world’s a hard, barren place. Words, they stick to the bones, like ash on a shroud. You fling somethin’ out into the ether,  onto the endless web, and it’s gone past recall. It hangs there, a ghost in the machine, for everyone to see. \n\nFolks, they get spooked easy. Whispers, they gather like smoke, twisting and turning into somethin’ monstrous. They see a flicker in the dark, a word or two on a screen, and their minds, they fill in the blanks with somethin’ terrible.  \n\nThis ain’t no time for games. Violence, it ain’t a joke.  It ain’t a way to get attention. It’s a stain, a wound that bleeds onto the world.\n\nPeople, they gotta take it seriously. They saw what happened at the school. Heard the whispers, saw the words etched in digital blood. They couldn’t just stand by and watch.\n\nBut sometimes, the line blurs.  What’s real, what’s just a child’s frantic cry in the night? A test gone wrong, or somethin’ dark and festering?\n\nThe world, it’s a brittle thing. A whisper, it can turn into a scream. A joke, it can become a nightmare.\n\nYou can’t control what people think, what they make of what you leave behind. You put it out there, it owns you. It owns them all.",
            "The war. A sickness that festers. A wound that won't close.  It began with a purpose, they said. Democracy. A righteous cause. To free a people from a tyrant's grip. But the seasons turned, the years bled into one another, and the purpose, like a paper flag, grew brittle and faded.  \n\nMaybe the reasons weren't pure from the start. Shadows in the past, whispers of old scores between men in high places. A game of chess played on a board of blood.\n\nBut even if the first move was righteous, the play has gone on too long. The world watches, a silent audience to a spectacle of futility. The echoes of victory faded long ago, swallowed by the dust of the desert.\n\nA year.  Decades.  The numbers blur. The cost, measured in lives and coin, a ledger that stretches to infinity.  \n\nWhat was gained? What was lost?  \n\nThe sons of men, sent to kill and be killed, their faces etched with the weariness of endless sand and sun. They fight for something intangible, a phantom of purpose.\n\nThe cities lie in ruin, their bones picked clean. The air hangs thick with the scent of death and regret.\n\nIt's a drain on the soul, a hemorrhage of the spirit. \n\nThere's a time to fight. And there's a time to walk away. To heal. To rebuild.\n\nThis war has lasted too long. It's time to go home.",
            "The boy spoke. A question, a tremor in his voice.  He wanted to know if it was okay, if it was right, if someone looking at him online, taking in his words, his pictures,  was an invasion.\n\n\"Myspace,\" he said.  \"They say it's private. But...\" \n\nHe trailed off, the unspoken question hanging in the air.  Like a cloud bank, heavy with doubts.\n\nI told him it was a fair question.  A question spun from the want to be seen, to be known, but also from the fear of being seen too much.  \n\n\"If you put something out there,\" I said, \"it's got a way of finding its way. Like water seeking a valley. Like smoke, it drifts, it spreads.\"\n\nHe nodded, his brow furrowed. I told him about the times, long ago, when folks used to whisper on the wind. How their words carried on the breeze, sometimes landing in ears they weren't meant for.  The internet was like that, only louder, faster, a storm of whispers on a wire.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"if someone's looking, they're looking for something. Like a hunter, they're tracking. And sometimes, in that tracking, they find what they need to stop something bad from happening.\"\n\nHe looked at me, his eyes wide.  He wanted to believe that.\n\nI told him it was a hard balance. The right to be seen, the right to be known, and the right to be left alone.  A dance on a knife's edge. \n\nWe sat there, the silence thick with the weight of possibilities.  The boy's question hung in the air, unanswered, yet somehow, in the asking, it had already found its own kind of answer.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, a stifling silence punctuated only by the rasp of breath. He spoke, but the words tasted like ash in his mouth.  \"Hypocritical,\" he muttered, the word a shard of glass in the stillness.  To speak of it now, to join the chorus of dissent, felt like a betrayal of some unspoken pact. He hated the notion of bandwagoning, of preaching to the choir. But the truth was a thing that gnawed at him, a dark, persistent hunger.\n\nIt had been a bad idea from the start, a folly writ large across the arid landscape of Iraq.  The polls were damning, a chorus of voices – Iraqi, American, global – all echoing the same lament. Seventy-five, eighty percent, drowning in a sea of regret. The men who bled on that cursed ground, soldiers bound by duty, even they saw the futility, yearned for the solace of home.\n\nHe remembered the weight of the news, the slow, inexorable drip of horror, the faces of the dead, the ghosts that haunted the airwaves. A disaster from the outset, a wound that festered and refused to heal. Pulling out was its own agony, a slow, agonizing death throe. The Middle East, a land steeped in ancient rites and whispered secrets, a place where sand swallowed dreams and shadows danced with demons. To impose a foreign will upon it, to force a mold that didn't fit, was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n\nSaddam, a tyrant, a monster, no doubt. But what was the cost of vengeance? Was it worth the blood spilled, the lives shattered, the echoes of sorrow that reverberated across the ages? The weight of history pressed down upon him, the stench of war a heavy shroud.\n\nHe longed for a simpler time, for the days when the world seemed less fraught, less poisoned. A day spent with his uncle, the quiet rhythm of oars against water, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. A day etched in memory, a fleeting moment of grace in a world consumed by darkness.\n\nNow, the future stretched before him, a desolate landscape, barren and unforgiving.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  There was a time, he reckoned, when the world breathed different. Now, it choked.  He felt it in his bones, this gnawing ache of a place forgetting how to live.  \n\nYes, he knew.  He knew the world still clung to its old ways, its stories half-told, its truths buried under layers of expectation.  A man, he thought,  should be the provider. A woman, the keeper of the hearth.  These were the echoes he heard, not just in the rustle of the wind, but in the whispers of men's eyes, in the furrow of a woman's brow.  \n\nHe saw it in the way a woman with ambition was met with doubt, in the way a man who chose to stay home with his children was looked upon with suspicion.  The world, he thought,  held these things close, like secrets whispered in the dark. \n\nHe remembered a time, long ago, when he sat with his uncle by the shore of a still lake.  They hauled in bleached logs from the water, the silence broken only by the slap of oars and the rasp of their calls.  The sun bled across the water, painting the trees in shades of gold and crimson.  It was a day etched in memory, a day of quiet understanding.  But even then, a shadow lurked.  His uncle, a man of few words, would puff on his pipe, his gaze steady on the horizon.  He’d seen things, the old man, things that left a scar on the soul.\n\nNow, the world was a canvas of ash and gray, the colors drained away by a slow, creeping despair.  The air itself felt heavy, laden with the weight of unspoken truths. And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that the fight for equality was far from over.",
            "The air hung thick with the smoke of burnt things. Not trees this time. Buildings. A city choked by dust and ash. They moved through the skeletal remains, the wind whispering through the empty windows like ghosts. He kept the boy close, a shadow in his wake. The boy asked, \"Are we going to die?\" The question hung in the air, a tendril of fear. \"Not now,\" he said, his voice rough. \"We're going south.\"\n\nDecriminalized, they called it. Like a cough, a mere nuisance to be endured. But the stain remained. The fear. The stigma. A whisper in the ear, a shadow on the soul. They passed a carcass of a car, its metal skin twisted and charred. A skull, bleached white, stared vacantly from the interior.  He felt a tug at his hand, the boy's small fingers clutching his. \"What's that?\" he whispered, pointing. A wordless question. He looked down at the boy, his face streaked with ash, eyes wide with a terror that mirrored his own.\n\n\"Just the wind,\" he lied, his voice hollow. \"The wind that carries the ashes.\" He wanted to tell him, to explain the things he didn't understand, the things he couldn't bear to confront. But the words were trapped in his throat, choked by the dust.\n\nHe thought of the lake, the old man in his straw hat, their oars slicing through the black water. A memory, a ghost of a warmth, a world before the ashes. He wished he could  hold onto it, but the wind stole it away, leaving behind only the bitter taste of smoke and the echo of a question: What was left of their world, what was left of them?\n\nThey walked on, the boy's hand still clutching his, two figures swallowed by the grayness.",
            "The world is a hard place. Even the good things, they can bruise you. Like this talk of tradition. It binds you, keeps you in your place. A good thing, maybe, if the place is right. But what if the world shifts? The ground cracks beneath you. This church, it's like an old house built on a fault line. Solid, sure. But the walls are thin, the foundation crumbles.  \n\nThey say, be rooted. Be steadfast. But the wind, it blows. And sometimes the roots give way. You feel it in the marrow. A coldness. A doubt.\n\nThey talk about rules, about following the path. But what if the path is leading to a dead end? What if the light at the end of the tunnel is just a flicker, a dying ember?\n\nMy father, he was different. Not of this church. Not of their way. And they turned their backs on him. On us. They say love is the answer. But love can't heal a broken heart. Love can't bridge the chasm of their judgment. It can't rebuild what they tore down. \n\nThey speak of perfection. But who among us is perfect? We are all cracked and flawed. We stumble, we fall.  We bleed. And they, they wear their judgments like armor, impenetrable, unforgiving. \n\nThey preach of acceptance. But who are they to accept or reject? They are not God. They are just men, cloaked in piety, their hands stained with hypocrisy.",
            "The weight of it pressed down. This question, this knot in the country's gut. Right and wrong, shadows stretched thin in the face of it. A line drawn in the dust, blurred by the wind.  Separation, church and state, a fragile thing, fraying at the edges. Marriage. What was it? A sacrament, a pact, a contract? \n\nHe squinted at the worn road ahead, dust devils swirling in the air.  Two souls bound, a union. Was it the state's business to define it?  To bless it? To tax it?  Like a baptism, a walk through holy water, a spiritual thing.  But the government, they saw it differently. Dollars and cents, a legal document.   \n\nHe thought of the old preacher, fire in his eyes, speaking of sin and salvation. Thought of the young couple, eyes locked, vows whispered. Two lives entwined.  And the others, same desire, same yearning, but denied the same right.  A hollow ache in the chest.\n\nCivil union. The words hung in the air, a compromise, a step towards something but not quite enough. Two people, bound together, a love that defied definition. Should the government dictate the terms of a heart's desire?\n\nHe looked up at the sky, vast and indifferent. This was the crux of the matter, wasn't it?  A battle fought on a battlefield of beliefs, a clash of cultures, a tearing of the fabric of society.  He didn't have the answers, only the questions.  But he knew this: to deny a love, a commitment, a bond, was to deny a part of the human experience.\n\nOne law for all, he thought, the old whisper echoing in his mind. A level playing field, a shared destiny.  A hope, a dream, a prayer. Maybe, just maybe, that's what they were all striving for.",
            "The world, he reckoned, was a weight on the soul. A gray stone pressing down, a burden carried from birth. And some things, like the sun setting in the west, were just the way they were. You couldn't fight it. Couldn't change it. So you lived with it. You carried it.\n\nHe'd been raised in a house where the Lord's word was law. Where men were men and women were women. And some things, like that,  just seemed right. Natural. But the world was changing. Shifting. And words like \"homosexuality,\" they felt foreign, like a sickness in the air.  \n\nHe knew some boys, good boys, who were different. And he felt a kind of pity for them, a sadness. Like watching a sparrow with a broken wing. He didn't want to judge. But he couldn't quite understand. It was a river he couldn't cross, a canyon too deep to bridge. He believed in God’s law. But he also believed in freedom. In men choosing their own paths.\n\nThe question, though, it gnawed at him. Did the Lord want it this way? Was it a sin? Or a choice? And who was he to say?  He felt like a man standing on the edge of something vast and unknown. The answers, they were whispers in the wind, lost in the dust of a dying world.\n\nHe thought of states like cities, each with its own laws, its own ways. Some open, some closed. Some welcoming, some hostile.  Maybe that was the way it should be. Each place deciding its own fate.  \n\nHe thought of the President, his face on a screen, his voice booming.  A man in a distant place making decisions that touched every corner of the land.  Did he know the cost of his words? The weight of their burden?\n\nNo, he thought. He didn't. \n\nHe just knew one thing. He couldn't let the world's darkness swallow him whole.  He had to hold onto what he knew, what he believed. And he had to hope that in the end, the light would find its way back.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the taste of dust and ash clinging to the back of his throat. He stared out at the road, a ribbon of gray winding through the skeletal remains of a forgotten world. The boy sat beside him, wrapped in a threadbare blanket, eyes fixed on the endless horizon. He knew what the boy was thinking.  They were lost. They were alone. And the road stretched before them, a barren testament to some long-gone catastrophe.\n\n\"Do you think we'll find anyone?\" the boy finally asked, his voice barely a whisper against the wind that snaked through the skeletal trees.\n\nThe man looked at him, his face etched with the weariness of a journey that had lasted too long. \"There might be,\" he said, the words rough and hollow. \"But maybe it's best if we don't.\"\n\nThe boy frowned, the crease deepening in his brow. \"Why?\"\n\nThe man didn't answer. He didn't have an answer. He just kept his gaze fixed on the road, searching for something, anything, that might offer a glimmer of hope in this desolate landscape. \n\nThey had been moving for what felt like an eternity, ever since the fire swept through their home, leaving behind only ash and silence. He carried the boy close, the weight of his small body a constant reminder of the precious life he was sworn to protect. \n\nHe remembered a time when the world had been different, a time when laughter echoed through the streets and the air was clean and sweet. But those memories were fading, swallowed up by the encroaching darkness that seemed to be consuming everything.\n\nHe tightened his grip on the pistol tucked into his belt, a cold comfort against the gnawing fear that coiled in his gut. There were dangers out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting to prey on the weak and the vulnerable. He had to keep the boy safe. He had to.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his face pale and drawn. The boy's eyes were wide and filled with a fear that mirrored his own. \n\n\"We'll be alright,\" he whispered, his voice hoarse. \"We'll be alright.\"\n\nBut even as he said the words, he wasn't sure if he believed them.",
            "The war. A sickness in the gut, that's what it was. At first, yes, the fire in the belly burned hot. Nine-Eleven. It ripped a hole in the sky, in the soul, and the rage spilled out.  Like a hawk, talons bared, ready to strike.  But the hawk forgets the cost of its fury.  We went in blind, eyes glazed over with grief and vengeance. No plan for the aftermath, just the need to bring the fire to those who dared touch the nest. \n\nAnd now? The fire has burned out, leaving only ash and hollowness.  The enemy's a shadow, a whisper in the wind. They fight amongst themselves, a pack of dogs tearing at scraps. Does it matter?  We throw stones, but the stones only splinter and scatter.\n\nThey're not like us. Their war is a different beast, a primal hunger. We brought them iron and steel, but they met it with blood and bone. We spoke of freedom, of democracy, but they heard only the clang of steel and the stench of death. \n\nWe went in for revenge, and found only more pain. We sought to build, but the ground was choked with rubble.  \n\nThe boy asked me once, \"Will we ever go home?\" I didn't know then. Don't know now.  We are lost in this labyrinth of dust and blood, searching for an exit that may not exist.\n\nThe truth is, we don't belong there. We brought the storm, but we cannot control the wind. We are strangers in a strange land, condemned to walk the wasteland until the dust settles and the echoes of our folly fade away."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, she needs changing. That much is clear. Their grip is loosening, a slow unraveling, and I reckon it's the old ways that are strangling them. The way they hold onto these things—gay marriage, abortion, birth control—it's like clutching onto rusted chains, dragging them further down. It’s a style of thinking that’s gone stale, forgotten the taste of the wind on a new day. \n\nThey cling to these ancient pronouncements, these lines in the sand drawn by men long gone.  But the world, it keeps turning. The river keeps flowing. And folks are waking up,  seeing the shadows lurking in those old stories. They're starting to drift away, seeking a place where they feel seen, where their own truths aren't met with judgment and scorn.\n\nThink of it, a life lived in the shadow of forbidden desires, of whispered secrets. A young heart yearning for love, but afraid to speak its name. A woman, her body a vessel denied its own autonomy.  They're not asking for much, just a voice, a place at the table. \n\nThe Church, it speaks of God's love, but where is that love in these pronouncements? Is it love that binds, that suffocates? Is it love that judges and condemns? \n\nThey talk of priests, men devoted to God. But isn't there devotion in the love of a family, the shared laughter, the tears shed together? Is a man's heart not capable of holding both God and the world?\n\nThey talk of what is right and wrong, but who are they to decide?  Whose whispers guide their pens, their pronouncements?  They stand on a mountain of stone, blind to the shifting sands below. They cling to their dogma, their rituals, their power, unaware that the world is moving on, leaving them behind in the dust.  Maybe, just maybe, it's time for them to open their eyes and see.",
            "The boy sat, chin resting on his knees, eyes bright with unshed tears. A question hung between them, heavy as the silence that pressed in from the sides. He looked up at the man, a question burning in his eyes. \"What’s wrong with them?\" he asked, voice barely a rasp.\n\nThe man shifted, tugging at the collar of his worn shirt.  His gaze drifted to the gray dust swirling outside, kicked up by a wind that tasted of ash and regret. \"It's not right,\" he finally said, his voice a low rumble. \"Not right at all.\" He looked back at the boy, his face drawn and hard. \"They try to say it’s a choice,\" he continued, \"like some sin you can just decide to leave behind. But it ain't that. You can't choose who you love, who you are.\"\n\nThe boy frowned, brow creased in confusion. \"But isn't that what love is? Choosing?\"\n\nThe man shook his head, a slow, weary motion. \"Love ain't a choice,\" he said, his voice a whisper against the wind. \"It's a thing that finds you, takes hold, and burrows deep inside. You can fight it, try to run, but it stays.\"\n\nHe reached out, his hand calloused and rough, and covered the boy's. \"Some folks,\" he said, \"they just don't understand. They fear what they don't know, what they can't control. They call it wrong, try to make it bad. But it ain't wrong, son. It's just...different.\"\n\nHe squeezed the boy's hand, a silent promise etched in the gesture. \"And different ain't always bad,\" he said, eyes filled with a weary hope. \"Sometimes, different is just...more.\"",
            "The road stretched before them, black and broken, a ribbon of ash in the dying light. The boy walked beside him, his shadow a thin wraith against the bone-colored dust.  \"Why can't folks just see it?\" the boy asked, his voice small in the vast emptiness. \n\nHe didn't answer. What was there to say? The world had gone quiet, choked by ash and the weight of silence.  They'd been walking for days, ever since the fire had come.  Every town, every village, reduced to smoldering skeletons.  Empty eyes staring up from the charred timbers, like the sockets of some great fallen beast. \n\nHe'd lost count of the days. The sun, a pale ghost behind the haze, offered no comfort. The nights were colder, gnawing at their insides.  \n\nThey came to a town, or what was left of it.  The wind whispered through the skeletal remains of buildings, carrying the scent of dust and decay. A rusted car lay overturned in the middle of the street, its shattered windshield like a vacant eye staring at the sky.\n\n\"Papa,\" the boy said, his voice tight. \"Do you think there's anyone else out here?\"\n\nHe looked at him, a flicker of something dark and ancient in his eyes. \"Maybe,\" he said. \"But it ain't a kind world anymore.\"\n\nThey pressed on, their footsteps echoing in the hollow silence.  They found an abandoned gas station, its pumps standing like crooked sentinels. The air was thick with the smell of gasoline, a phantom scent of a world that was gone.\n\nHe squeezed the boy's shoulder, a brief moment of connection in the vast emptiness. \"We'll find a place,\" he said, his voice rough with exhaustion. \"A place where it ain't so…\" He trailed off, unable to find the words.\n\nThe boy nodded, his eyes filled with a wisdom beyond his years.  \"We'll be alright,\" he said.\n\nHe didn't know if it was true. But he had to believe it. For the boy's sake, if nothing else.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the scent of stale medicine and disinfectant clinging to the walls. He spoke, his voice a low murmur in the quiet room. \"Just because something's outlawed,\" he said, \"doesn't mean it holds no good.\" \n\nHe paused, the silence stretching like a taut wire. \"You see, in this pharmacy,\" he continued, \"we deal with things the world calls 'dangerous.'  Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets - names whispered with fear, yet they ease pain, they mend broken bodies. People need these things.\" \n\nHe looked up, his eyes hard and unwavering. \"And what about this plant? This weed they call marijuana? Just because it's cast out, deemed evil, doesn't mean its uses are gone. It has its uses, its purpose. Denying it simply because of a stigma, well, that's folly.\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"Think about it. The fear, the whispers, they cloud the truth. Like alcohol, it can be abused.  But so can water.  It's not the thing itself, it's the mind that makes it poison.  We need to see it for what it is, for what it can do. Not what they tell us it is.\"\n\nHe sighed, the sound heavy with weariness. \"Gradual, that's the key.  Open the door, let the light in.  Let people see its worth, its potential.\" He paused, his gaze distant. \"Strip away the fear.  Then, maybe, just maybe, they'll use it with wisdom, with care.\"",
            "The church, she'd changed. It ain't the same as it was. Back when she was a girl, Sundays meant a dress, shoes, a purse - all matching, every damn Sunday.  Private school, and all the girls dressed the same, same faces, same small talk. Now? Mass is a blur. Thirty minutes tops. They call it \"teenager mass.\" Jeans, t-shirts, sand still clinging to sandals from the beach. Folks spilling in late, kids restless. Even the morning masses, the ones she used to dress up for, folks come in jeans and khakis now.  It's different. \n\nAs for the other things, the whispers, the shadows... she don't know the politics, the machinations of men in robes. But that's the church she knows. The one that's changed, gone casual. \n\nMaybe it's for the better. Maybe it's not.\n\n\n\nShe'd sat in the rowboat, a boy again, fishing with her uncle. His old straw hat, a black pipe always dangling from his teeth, a steady puff of smoke. They'd rowed across the lake, silent, except for the scrape of oars against water.  The air thick with the smell of pines and wet earth.  \n\nThose days, they were perfect. The kind that shape a life.\n\nThose days are gone.",
            "The air hung thick with the grime of it. The dust of lies. They’d told us it was different.  A war against terror, a crusade for freedom.  But the truth, the cold, hard truth, settled in the gut like ash.  They’d tied it to Bin Laden, to the ghosts of September, to phantom weapons.  A tapestry woven of deceit.  And the man at the helm, he spun the threads with a cold, practiced hand. \n\nPowell, even he – the man who stood before the world, brandishing the lies as truth – now whispers doubts.  A slow, creeping realization that the foundation was rotten.  But the damage was done.  The blood spilled. The lives consumed. A country broken.\n\nThey spoke of justice, of a new world order. But the stench of hypocrisy hung heavy in the air.  The Constitution, that sacred document, trampled underfoot.  They’d come for war, it seemed, with a hunger born of vengeance and a thirst for dominion.  The oil, a siren song, a whisper in the dark.\n\nAnd now, years later, the reckoning draws near.  A fragile peace hangs by a thread, a coalition cobbled together from the ashes of a broken land.  But who will fill the void?  Whose hands will grip the reins?  The ghosts of the past linger, the echoes of violence still resonate.  \n\nIraq bleeds, a canvas painted in shades of sorrow.  And the world watches, a silent observer to a tragedy of its own making.",
            "The air hung still and low, thick as dust.  The words caught in his throat, a dry rasp. He watched the boy, his face pale and drawn in the weak light filtering through the leaves. \n\n\"It's pointless,\" he finally said, the words tasting like ash on his tongue. \"A reckoning, that's what it is. Retribution. They figured it was them, them and their shadows. But who knows truth anymore? It's all gone to ash.\" \n\nHe spat on the ground, a black fleck against the gray dirt. \"Not a real war, not like they used to call them. Congress never said the word. But the guns, they speak a language of their own. A language of power and fear.\"\n\nHe pulled the boy closer, the child's thin frame a weight against his chest.  \"Democracy,\" he said, the word a bitter joke. \"A word tossed around like a useless trinket.  They think they can build it, mold it, like clay.  But a people's heart, it ain't so easily shaped.\"\n\n\"It's a trap,\" he whispered, his voice a low growl. \"A trap of oil and whispers, of promises made and broken. We stay, we bleed, we watch them bleed. And for what? To make it our own? To claim a piece of their dust?\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, his eyes dark and haunted. \"It's a wound that never heals, this thing. A sickness that festers. They'll learn, they'll understand, when the dust settles and the ghosts of the dead walk the streets. That this was never ours to take.\"",
            "The air hung heavy with the silence of things unsaid. The law, he thought, a web spun by men with hearts cold as stone.  To say it was wrong, to try and bind it with words on parchment, felt like a violation. The words themselves, \"separation of church and state,\" echoed in his mind, a hollow promise whispered on the wind.  Was it truly separation, or a delicate balance, a line drawn in the dust that could be erased by the weight of a man's conviction?\n\nThe churches, they should decide. Let them wrestle with their scriptures, with the weight of their own beliefs. To force his will upon them, to impose his own god upon them, felt like a betrayal of the very soul of this land.  It was a war, he thought, waged not with swords and fire, but with whispered prayers and unspoken fears.\n\nThe man spoke of amendments, of changing the very fabric of the nation.  But the Constitution, it was already written. The ink, it had dried long ago. To alter it now, to bend it to his will, felt like a desecration.\n\nHe thought of the old country, the land of his ancestors.  A place where the church held sway, where the whispers of the priests were law.  A place where dissent was met with silence, and silence was a prison.  He had come here, seeking refuge, seeking a place where the soul could breathe free.  And now, this.  This attempt to shackle the spirit, to bind it to the whims of men.\n\nNo, he thought.  Let the churches decide. Let them fight their battles in the quiet corners of their sanctuaries. But keep the government out of it.  For in the end, it was not the laws that mattered, but the hearts of men.   And those hearts, he believed, were best left untamed.",
            "The dust hung low, a gray shroud over the skeletal trees. The air itself tasted of ash. The war in Iraq. It started with a lie, a whisper of connection to those dark days in September, a phantom pain they tried to stitch to their own anger. A wound that wasn't theirs, yet they bled for it. 2003, the year the world tilted on its axis.  \n\nThey called it a preemptive strike, a necessary evil. Me, I knew better. War isn't a surgical incision, it's a mauling, a tearing apart of everything in its path. I've seen it, felt its poisoned breath on my skin.  Just like Vietnam, a hollow victory, a quagmire of blood and broken promises. \n\nThey thought they could simply pick a new king, install their own kind of order.  They didn't understand. It's not that simple. You can't stitch democracy onto a land steeped in ancient grievances, in the bitter dust of generations lost. The echoes of their failures in Vietnam, they clung to them like ghosts.\n\nThey said it would be quick, a surge and then a withdrawal. A swift tide, in and out, leaving behind a cleansed shore. But the tide turned, the water receded, leaving behind a wasteland.  \n\nThe bodies piled up, young men, sons, husbands, fathers, all for a lie, all for a promise that withered on the wind. And the people, the ones they swore to liberate, they became the enemy.  \n\nNo, it wasn't a glorious crusade. It was a slow, burning hell, fueled by greed and fear, by the insatiable hunger for power. And the ghosts, the ghosts of those lost, they whisper in the wind. They whisper of a land forever scarred, of promises broken, of a war that never truly ended.",
            "The words caught in his throat, a knot of heat and ash.  He cleared it, raspy. \"I'm... I'm for it. Always have been.\" He fumbled for the right words, the words that wouldn't betray the conviction that bloomed in his chest. \"It's a matter of... choice. It's in the blood, see? Not some damn social fad. You can't legislate desire, can't legislate who a man loves.\"\n\nHe looked out across the barren landscape, a wasteland of dust and broken dreams. \"To take that away, to deny them the same rights... it's inhumane. Like watching a bird with a clipped wing, forced to crawl.\"\n\nHe thought of the families on his street, the ones who lived in the shadow of what they couldn't have. \"Just regular folks, trying to live their lives. Walking their dogs, laughing in the sun. Same as anyone else.\"  \n\nHe felt the anger rise, hot and bitter. \"Bush, playing God... twisting the meaning of marriage to fit his own damn agenda. It's a personal thing, a matter between two souls. Not some holy relic for the state to claim.\"\n\nThe silence stretched, heavy and oppressive. He tried to find the words again, to articulate the truth that burned in his gut. \"Science is catching up. They're finding out, proving it... this isn't a choice. It's a part of who you are, wired into your very being.\" He paused, his voice raw. \"You can't un-love someone, just like you can't un-see the sky.\"",
            "The world’s a hard, barren place. Words, they stick to the bones, like ash on a shroud. You fling somethin’ out into the ether,  onto the endless web, and it’s gone past recall. It hangs there, a ghost in the machine, for everyone to see. \n\nFolks, they get spooked easy. Whispers, they gather like smoke, twisting and turning into somethin’ monstrous. They see a flicker in the dark, a word or two on a screen, and their minds, they fill in the blanks with somethin’ terrible.  \n\nThis ain’t no time for games. Violence, it ain’t a joke.  It ain’t a way to get attention. It’s a stain, a wound that bleeds onto the world.\n\nPeople, they gotta take it seriously. They saw what happened at the school. Heard the whispers, saw the words etched in digital blood. They couldn’t just stand by and watch.\n\nBut sometimes, the line blurs.  What’s real, what’s just a child’s frantic cry in the night? A test gone wrong, or somethin’ dark and festering?\n\nThe world, it’s a brittle thing. A whisper, it can turn into a scream. A joke, it can become a nightmare.\n\nYou can’t control what people think, what they make of what you leave behind. You put it out there, it owns you. It owns them all.",
            "The war. A sickness that festers. A wound that won't close.  It began with a purpose, they said. Democracy. A righteous cause. To free a people from a tyrant's grip. But the seasons turned, the years bled into one another, and the purpose, like a paper flag, grew brittle and faded.  \n\nMaybe the reasons weren't pure from the start. Shadows in the past, whispers of old scores between men in high places. A game of chess played on a board of blood.\n\nBut even if the first move was righteous, the play has gone on too long. The world watches, a silent audience to a spectacle of futility. The echoes of victory faded long ago, swallowed by the dust of the desert.\n\nA year.  Decades.  The numbers blur. The cost, measured in lives and coin, a ledger that stretches to infinity.  \n\nWhat was gained? What was lost?  \n\nThe sons of men, sent to kill and be killed, their faces etched with the weariness of endless sand and sun. They fight for something intangible, a phantom of purpose.\n\nThe cities lie in ruin, their bones picked clean. The air hangs thick with the scent of death and regret.\n\nIt's a drain on the soul, a hemorrhage of the spirit. \n\nThere's a time to fight. And there's a time to walk away. To heal. To rebuild.\n\nThis war has lasted too long. It's time to go home.",
            "The boy spoke. A question, a tremor in his voice.  He wanted to know if it was okay, if it was right, if someone looking at him online, taking in his words, his pictures,  was an invasion.\n\n\"Myspace,\" he said.  \"They say it's private. But...\" \n\nHe trailed off, the unspoken question hanging in the air.  Like a cloud bank, heavy with doubts.\n\nI told him it was a fair question.  A question spun from the want to be seen, to be known, but also from the fear of being seen too much.  \n\n\"If you put something out there,\" I said, \"it's got a way of finding its way. Like water seeking a valley. Like smoke, it drifts, it spreads.\"\n\nHe nodded, his brow furrowed. I told him about the times, long ago, when folks used to whisper on the wind. How their words carried on the breeze, sometimes landing in ears they weren't meant for.  The internet was like that, only louder, faster, a storm of whispers on a wire.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"if someone's looking, they're looking for something. Like a hunter, they're tracking. And sometimes, in that tracking, they find what they need to stop something bad from happening.\"\n\nHe looked at me, his eyes wide.  He wanted to believe that.\n\nI told him it was a hard balance. The right to be seen, the right to be known, and the right to be left alone.  A dance on a knife's edge. \n\nWe sat there, the silence thick with the weight of possibilities.  The boy's question hung in the air, unanswered, yet somehow, in the asking, it had already found its own kind of answer.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, a stifling silence punctuated only by the rasp of breath. He spoke, but the words tasted like ash in his mouth.  \"Hypocritical,\" he muttered, the word a shard of glass in the stillness.  To speak of it now, to join the chorus of dissent, felt like a betrayal of some unspoken pact. He hated the notion of bandwagoning, of preaching to the choir. But the truth was a thing that gnawed at him, a dark, persistent hunger.\n\nIt had been a bad idea from the start, a folly writ large across the arid landscape of Iraq.  The polls were damning, a chorus of voices – Iraqi, American, global – all echoing the same lament. Seventy-five, eighty percent, drowning in a sea of regret. The men who bled on that cursed ground, soldiers bound by duty, even they saw the futility, yearned for the solace of home.\n\nHe remembered the weight of the news, the slow, inexorable drip of horror, the faces of the dead, the ghosts that haunted the airwaves. A disaster from the outset, a wound that festered and refused to heal. Pulling out was its own agony, a slow, agonizing death throe. The Middle East, a land steeped in ancient rites and whispered secrets, a place where sand swallowed dreams and shadows danced with demons. To impose a foreign will upon it, to force a mold that didn't fit, was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n\nSaddam, a tyrant, a monster, no doubt. But what was the cost of vengeance? Was it worth the blood spilled, the lives shattered, the echoes of sorrow that reverberated across the ages? The weight of history pressed down upon him, the stench of war a heavy shroud.\n\nHe longed for a simpler time, for the days when the world seemed less fraught, less poisoned. A day spent with his uncle, the quiet rhythm of oars against water, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. A day etched in memory, a fleeting moment of grace in a world consumed by darkness.\n\nNow, the future stretched before him, a desolate landscape, barren and unforgiving.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  There was a time, he reckoned, when the world breathed different. Now, it choked.  He felt it in his bones, this gnawing ache of a place forgetting how to live.  \n\nYes, he knew.  He knew the world still clung to its old ways, its stories half-told, its truths buried under layers of expectation.  A man, he thought,  should be the provider. A woman, the keeper of the hearth.  These were the echoes he heard, not just in the rustle of the wind, but in the whispers of men's eyes, in the furrow of a woman's brow.  \n\nHe saw it in the way a woman with ambition was met with doubt, in the way a man who chose to stay home with his children was looked upon with suspicion.  The world, he thought,  held these things close, like secrets whispered in the dark. \n\nHe remembered a time, long ago, when he sat with his uncle by the shore of a still lake.  They hauled in bleached logs from the water, the silence broken only by the slap of oars and the rasp of their calls.  The sun bled across the water, painting the trees in shades of gold and crimson.  It was a day etched in memory, a day of quiet understanding.  But even then, a shadow lurked.  His uncle, a man of few words, would puff on his pipe, his gaze steady on the horizon.  He’d seen things, the old man, things that left a scar on the soul.\n\nNow, the world was a canvas of ash and gray, the colors drained away by a slow, creeping despair.  The air itself felt heavy, laden with the weight of unspoken truths. And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that the fight for equality was far from over.",
            "The air hung thick with the smoke of burnt things. Not trees this time. Buildings. A city choked by dust and ash. They moved through the skeletal remains, the wind whispering through the empty windows like ghosts. He kept the boy close, a shadow in his wake. The boy asked, \"Are we going to die?\" The question hung in the air, a tendril of fear. \"Not now,\" he said, his voice rough. \"We're going south.\"\n\nDecriminalized, they called it. Like a cough, a mere nuisance to be endured. But the stain remained. The fear. The stigma. A whisper in the ear, a shadow on the soul. They passed a carcass of a car, its metal skin twisted and charred. A skull, bleached white, stared vacantly from the interior.  He felt a tug at his hand, the boy's small fingers clutching his. \"What's that?\" he whispered, pointing. A wordless question. He looked down at the boy, his face streaked with ash, eyes wide with a terror that mirrored his own.\n\n\"Just the wind,\" he lied, his voice hollow. \"The wind that carries the ashes.\" He wanted to tell him, to explain the things he didn't understand, the things he couldn't bear to confront. But the words were trapped in his throat, choked by the dust.\n\nHe thought of the lake, the old man in his straw hat, their oars slicing through the black water. A memory, a ghost of a warmth, a world before the ashes. He wished he could  hold onto it, but the wind stole it away, leaving behind only the bitter taste of smoke and the echo of a question: What was left of their world, what was left of them?\n\nThey walked on, the boy's hand still clutching his, two figures swallowed by the grayness.",
            "The world is a hard place. Even the good things, they can bruise you. Like this talk of tradition. It binds you, keeps you in your place. A good thing, maybe, if the place is right. But what if the world shifts? The ground cracks beneath you. This church, it's like an old house built on a fault line. Solid, sure. But the walls are thin, the foundation crumbles.  \n\nThey say, be rooted. Be steadfast. But the wind, it blows. And sometimes the roots give way. You feel it in the marrow. A coldness. A doubt.\n\nThey talk about rules, about following the path. But what if the path is leading to a dead end? What if the light at the end of the tunnel is just a flicker, a dying ember?\n\nMy father, he was different. Not of this church. Not of their way. And they turned their backs on him. On us. They say love is the answer. But love can't heal a broken heart. Love can't bridge the chasm of their judgment. It can't rebuild what they tore down. \n\nThey speak of perfection. But who among us is perfect? We are all cracked and flawed. We stumble, we fall.  We bleed. And they, they wear their judgments like armor, impenetrable, unforgiving. \n\nThey preach of acceptance. But who are they to accept or reject? They are not God. They are just men, cloaked in piety, their hands stained with hypocrisy.",
            "The weight of it pressed down. This question, this knot in the country's gut. Right and wrong, shadows stretched thin in the face of it. A line drawn in the dust, blurred by the wind.  Separation, church and state, a fragile thing, fraying at the edges. Marriage. What was it? A sacrament, a pact, a contract? \n\nHe squinted at the worn road ahead, dust devils swirling in the air.  Two souls bound, a union. Was it the state's business to define it?  To bless it? To tax it?  Like a baptism, a walk through holy water, a spiritual thing.  But the government, they saw it differently. Dollars and cents, a legal document.   \n\nHe thought of the old preacher, fire in his eyes, speaking of sin and salvation. Thought of the young couple, eyes locked, vows whispered. Two lives entwined.  And the others, same desire, same yearning, but denied the same right.  A hollow ache in the chest.\n\nCivil union. The words hung in the air, a compromise, a step towards something but not quite enough. Two people, bound together, a love that defied definition. Should the government dictate the terms of a heart's desire?\n\nHe looked up at the sky, vast and indifferent. This was the crux of the matter, wasn't it?  A battle fought on a battlefield of beliefs, a clash of cultures, a tearing of the fabric of society.  He didn't have the answers, only the questions.  But he knew this: to deny a love, a commitment, a bond, was to deny a part of the human experience.\n\nOne law for all, he thought, the old whisper echoing in his mind. A level playing field, a shared destiny.  A hope, a dream, a prayer. Maybe, just maybe, that's what they were all striving for.",
            "The world, he reckoned, was a weight on the soul. A gray stone pressing down, a burden carried from birth. And some things, like the sun setting in the west, were just the way they were. You couldn't fight it. Couldn't change it. So you lived with it. You carried it.\n\nHe'd been raised in a house where the Lord's word was law. Where men were men and women were women. And some things, like that,  just seemed right. Natural. But the world was changing. Shifting. And words like \"homosexuality,\" they felt foreign, like a sickness in the air.  \n\nHe knew some boys, good boys, who were different. And he felt a kind of pity for them, a sadness. Like watching a sparrow with a broken wing. He didn't want to judge. But he couldn't quite understand. It was a river he couldn't cross, a canyon too deep to bridge. He believed in God’s law. But he also believed in freedom. In men choosing their own paths.\n\nThe question, though, it gnawed at him. Did the Lord want it this way? Was it a sin? Or a choice? And who was he to say?  He felt like a man standing on the edge of something vast and unknown. The answers, they were whispers in the wind, lost in the dust of a dying world.\n\nHe thought of states like cities, each with its own laws, its own ways. Some open, some closed. Some welcoming, some hostile.  Maybe that was the way it should be. Each place deciding its own fate.  \n\nHe thought of the President, his face on a screen, his voice booming.  A man in a distant place making decisions that touched every corner of the land.  Did he know the cost of his words? The weight of their burden?\n\nNo, he thought. He didn't. \n\nHe just knew one thing. He couldn't let the world's darkness swallow him whole.  He had to hold onto what he knew, what he believed. And he had to hope that in the end, the light would find its way back.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the taste of dust and ash clinging to the back of his throat. He stared out at the road, a ribbon of gray winding through the skeletal remains of a forgotten world. The boy sat beside him, wrapped in a threadbare blanket, eyes fixed on the endless horizon. He knew what the boy was thinking.  They were lost. They were alone. And the road stretched before them, a barren testament to some long-gone catastrophe.\n\n\"Do you think we'll find anyone?\" the boy finally asked, his voice barely a whisper against the wind that snaked through the skeletal trees.\n\nThe man looked at him, his face etched with the weariness of a journey that had lasted too long. \"There might be,\" he said, the words rough and hollow. \"But maybe it's best if we don't.\"\n\nThe boy frowned, the crease deepening in his brow. \"Why?\"\n\nThe man didn't answer. He didn't have an answer. He just kept his gaze fixed on the road, searching for something, anything, that might offer a glimmer of hope in this desolate landscape. \n\nThey had been moving for what felt like an eternity, ever since the fire swept through their home, leaving behind only ash and silence. He carried the boy close, the weight of his small body a constant reminder of the precious life he was sworn to protect. \n\nHe remembered a time when the world had been different, a time when laughter echoed through the streets and the air was clean and sweet. But those memories were fading, swallowed up by the encroaching darkness that seemed to be consuming everything.\n\nHe tightened his grip on the pistol tucked into his belt, a cold comfort against the gnawing fear that coiled in his gut. There were dangers out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting to prey on the weak and the vulnerable. He had to keep the boy safe. He had to.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his face pale and drawn. The boy's eyes were wide and filled with a fear that mirrored his own. \n\n\"We'll be alright,\" he whispered, his voice hoarse. \"We'll be alright.\"\n\nBut even as he said the words, he wasn't sure if he believed them.",
            "The war. A sickness in the gut, that's what it was. At first, yes, the fire in the belly burned hot. Nine-Eleven. It ripped a hole in the sky, in the soul, and the rage spilled out.  Like a hawk, talons bared, ready to strike.  But the hawk forgets the cost of its fury.  We went in blind, eyes glazed over with grief and vengeance. No plan for the aftermath, just the need to bring the fire to those who dared touch the nest. \n\nAnd now? The fire has burned out, leaving only ash and hollowness.  The enemy's a shadow, a whisper in the wind. They fight amongst themselves, a pack of dogs tearing at scraps. Does it matter?  We throw stones, but the stones only splinter and scatter.\n\nThey're not like us. Their war is a different beast, a primal hunger. We brought them iron and steel, but they met it with blood and bone. We spoke of freedom, of democracy, but they heard only the clang of steel and the stench of death. \n\nWe went in for revenge, and found only more pain. We sought to build, but the ground was choked with rubble.  \n\nThe boy asked me once, \"Will we ever go home?\" I didn't know then. Don't know now.  We are lost in this labyrinth of dust and blood, searching for an exit that may not exist.\n\nThe truth is, we don't belong there. We brought the storm, but we cannot control the wind. We are strangers in a strange land, condemned to walk the wasteland until the dust settles and the echoes of our folly fade away."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, she needs changing. That much is clear. Their grip is loosening, a slow unraveling, and I reckon it's the old ways that are strangling them. The way they hold onto these things—gay marriage, abortion, birth control—it's like clutching onto rusted chains, dragging them further down. It’s a style of thinking that’s gone stale, forgotten the taste of the wind on a new day. \n\nThey cling to these ancient pronouncements, these lines in the sand drawn by men long gone.  But the world, it keeps turning. The river keeps flowing. And folks are waking up,  seeing the shadows lurking in those old stories. They're starting to drift away, seeking a place where they feel seen, where their own truths aren't met with judgment and scorn.\n\nThink of it, a life lived in the shadow of forbidden desires, of whispered secrets. A young heart yearning for love, but afraid to speak its name. A woman, her body a vessel denied its own autonomy.  They're not asking for much, just a voice, a place at the table. \n\nThe Church, it speaks of God's love, but where is that love in these pronouncements? Is it love that binds, that suffocates? Is it love that judges and condemns? \n\nThey talk of priests, men devoted to God. But isn't there devotion in the love of a family, the shared laughter, the tears shed together? Is a man's heart not capable of holding both God and the world?\n\nThey talk of what is right and wrong, but who are they to decide?  Whose whispers guide their pens, their pronouncements?  They stand on a mountain of stone, blind to the shifting sands below. They cling to their dogma, their rituals, their power, unaware that the world is moving on, leaving them behind in the dust.  Maybe, just maybe, it's time for them to open their eyes and see.",
            "The boy sat, chin resting on his knees, eyes bright with unshed tears. A question hung between them, heavy as the silence that pressed in from the sides. He looked up at the man, a question burning in his eyes. \"What’s wrong with them?\" he asked, voice barely a rasp.\n\nThe man shifted, tugging at the collar of his worn shirt.  His gaze drifted to the gray dust swirling outside, kicked up by a wind that tasted of ash and regret. \"It's not right,\" he finally said, his voice a low rumble. \"Not right at all.\" He looked back at the boy, his face drawn and hard. \"They try to say it’s a choice,\" he continued, \"like some sin you can just decide to leave behind. But it ain't that. You can't choose who you love, who you are.\"\n\nThe boy frowned, brow creased in confusion. \"But isn't that what love is? Choosing?\"\n\nThe man shook his head, a slow, weary motion. \"Love ain't a choice,\" he said, his voice a whisper against the wind. \"It's a thing that finds you, takes hold, and burrows deep inside. You can fight it, try to run, but it stays.\"\n\nHe reached out, his hand calloused and rough, and covered the boy's. \"Some folks,\" he said, \"they just don't understand. They fear what they don't know, what they can't control. They call it wrong, try to make it bad. But it ain't wrong, son. It's just...different.\"\n\nHe squeezed the boy's hand, a silent promise etched in the gesture. \"And different ain't always bad,\" he said, eyes filled with a weary hope. \"Sometimes, different is just...more.\"",
            "The road stretched before them, black and broken, a ribbon of ash in the dying light. The boy walked beside him, his shadow a thin wraith against the bone-colored dust.  \"Why can't folks just see it?\" the boy asked, his voice small in the vast emptiness. \n\nHe didn't answer. What was there to say? The world had gone quiet, choked by ash and the weight of silence.  They'd been walking for days, ever since the fire had come.  Every town, every village, reduced to smoldering skeletons.  Empty eyes staring up from the charred timbers, like the sockets of some great fallen beast. \n\nHe'd lost count of the days. The sun, a pale ghost behind the haze, offered no comfort. The nights were colder, gnawing at their insides.  \n\nThey came to a town, or what was left of it.  The wind whispered through the skeletal remains of buildings, carrying the scent of dust and decay. A rusted car lay overturned in the middle of the street, its shattered windshield like a vacant eye staring at the sky.\n\n\"Papa,\" the boy said, his voice tight. \"Do you think there's anyone else out here?\"\n\nHe looked at him, a flicker of something dark and ancient in his eyes. \"Maybe,\" he said. \"But it ain't a kind world anymore.\"\n\nThey pressed on, their footsteps echoing in the hollow silence.  They found an abandoned gas station, its pumps standing like crooked sentinels. The air was thick with the smell of gasoline, a phantom scent of a world that was gone.\n\nHe squeezed the boy's shoulder, a brief moment of connection in the vast emptiness. \"We'll find a place,\" he said, his voice rough with exhaustion. \"A place where it ain't so…\" He trailed off, unable to find the words.\n\nThe boy nodded, his eyes filled with a wisdom beyond his years.  \"We'll be alright,\" he said.\n\nHe didn't know if it was true. But he had to believe it. For the boy's sake, if nothing else.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the scent of stale medicine and disinfectant clinging to the walls. He spoke, his voice a low murmur in the quiet room. \"Just because something's outlawed,\" he said, \"doesn't mean it holds no good.\" \n\nHe paused, the silence stretching like a taut wire. \"You see, in this pharmacy,\" he continued, \"we deal with things the world calls 'dangerous.'  Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets - names whispered with fear, yet they ease pain, they mend broken bodies. People need these things.\" \n\nHe looked up, his eyes hard and unwavering. \"And what about this plant? This weed they call marijuana? Just because it's cast out, deemed evil, doesn't mean its uses are gone. It has its uses, its purpose. Denying it simply because of a stigma, well, that's folly.\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"Think about it. The fear, the whispers, they cloud the truth. Like alcohol, it can be abused.  But so can water.  It's not the thing itself, it's the mind that makes it poison.  We need to see it for what it is, for what it can do. Not what they tell us it is.\"\n\nHe sighed, the sound heavy with weariness. \"Gradual, that's the key.  Open the door, let the light in.  Let people see its worth, its potential.\" He paused, his gaze distant. \"Strip away the fear.  Then, maybe, just maybe, they'll use it with wisdom, with care.\"",
            "The church, she'd changed. It ain't the same as it was. Back when she was a girl, Sundays meant a dress, shoes, a purse - all matching, every damn Sunday.  Private school, and all the girls dressed the same, same faces, same small talk. Now? Mass is a blur. Thirty minutes tops. They call it \"teenager mass.\" Jeans, t-shirts, sand still clinging to sandals from the beach. Folks spilling in late, kids restless. Even the morning masses, the ones she used to dress up for, folks come in jeans and khakis now.  It's different. \n\nAs for the other things, the whispers, the shadows... she don't know the politics, the machinations of men in robes. But that's the church she knows. The one that's changed, gone casual. \n\nMaybe it's for the better. Maybe it's not.\n\n\n\nShe'd sat in the rowboat, a boy again, fishing with her uncle. His old straw hat, a black pipe always dangling from his teeth, a steady puff of smoke. They'd rowed across the lake, silent, except for the scrape of oars against water.  The air thick with the smell of pines and wet earth.  \n\nThose days, they were perfect. The kind that shape a life.\n\nThose days are gone.",
            "The air hung thick with the grime of it. The dust of lies. They’d told us it was different.  A war against terror, a crusade for freedom.  But the truth, the cold, hard truth, settled in the gut like ash.  They’d tied it to Bin Laden, to the ghosts of September, to phantom weapons.  A tapestry woven of deceit.  And the man at the helm, he spun the threads with a cold, practiced hand. \n\nPowell, even he – the man who stood before the world, brandishing the lies as truth – now whispers doubts.  A slow, creeping realization that the foundation was rotten.  But the damage was done.  The blood spilled. The lives consumed. A country broken.\n\nThey spoke of justice, of a new world order. But the stench of hypocrisy hung heavy in the air.  The Constitution, that sacred document, trampled underfoot.  They’d come for war, it seemed, with a hunger born of vengeance and a thirst for dominion.  The oil, a siren song, a whisper in the dark.\n\nAnd now, years later, the reckoning draws near.  A fragile peace hangs by a thread, a coalition cobbled together from the ashes of a broken land.  But who will fill the void?  Whose hands will grip the reins?  The ghosts of the past linger, the echoes of violence still resonate.  \n\nIraq bleeds, a canvas painted in shades of sorrow.  And the world watches, a silent observer to a tragedy of its own making.",
            "The air hung still and low, thick as dust.  The words caught in his throat, a dry rasp. He watched the boy, his face pale and drawn in the weak light filtering through the leaves. \n\n\"It's pointless,\" he finally said, the words tasting like ash on his tongue. \"A reckoning, that's what it is. Retribution. They figured it was them, them and their shadows. But who knows truth anymore? It's all gone to ash.\" \n\nHe spat on the ground, a black fleck against the gray dirt. \"Not a real war, not like they used to call them. Congress never said the word. But the guns, they speak a language of their own. A language of power and fear.\"\n\nHe pulled the boy closer, the child's thin frame a weight against his chest.  \"Democracy,\" he said, the word a bitter joke. \"A word tossed around like a useless trinket.  They think they can build it, mold it, like clay.  But a people's heart, it ain't so easily shaped.\"\n\n\"It's a trap,\" he whispered, his voice a low growl. \"A trap of oil and whispers, of promises made and broken. We stay, we bleed, we watch them bleed. And for what? To make it our own? To claim a piece of their dust?\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, his eyes dark and haunted. \"It's a wound that never heals, this thing. A sickness that festers. They'll learn, they'll understand, when the dust settles and the ghosts of the dead walk the streets. That this was never ours to take.\"",
            "The air hung heavy with the silence of things unsaid. The law, he thought, a web spun by men with hearts cold as stone.  To say it was wrong, to try and bind it with words on parchment, felt like a violation. The words themselves, \"separation of church and state,\" echoed in his mind, a hollow promise whispered on the wind.  Was it truly separation, or a delicate balance, a line drawn in the dust that could be erased by the weight of a man's conviction?\n\nThe churches, they should decide. Let them wrestle with their scriptures, with the weight of their own beliefs. To force his will upon them, to impose his own god upon them, felt like a betrayal of the very soul of this land.  It was a war, he thought, waged not with swords and fire, but with whispered prayers and unspoken fears.\n\nThe man spoke of amendments, of changing the very fabric of the nation.  But the Constitution, it was already written. The ink, it had dried long ago. To alter it now, to bend it to his will, felt like a desecration.\n\nHe thought of the old country, the land of his ancestors.  A place where the church held sway, where the whispers of the priests were law.  A place where dissent was met with silence, and silence was a prison.  He had come here, seeking refuge, seeking a place where the soul could breathe free.  And now, this.  This attempt to shackle the spirit, to bind it to the whims of men.\n\nNo, he thought.  Let the churches decide. Let them fight their battles in the quiet corners of their sanctuaries. But keep the government out of it.  For in the end, it was not the laws that mattered, but the hearts of men.   And those hearts, he believed, were best left untamed.",
            "The dust hung low, a gray shroud over the skeletal trees. The air itself tasted of ash. The war in Iraq. It started with a lie, a whisper of connection to those dark days in September, a phantom pain they tried to stitch to their own anger. A wound that wasn't theirs, yet they bled for it. 2003, the year the world tilted on its axis.  \n\nThey called it a preemptive strike, a necessary evil. Me, I knew better. War isn't a surgical incision, it's a mauling, a tearing apart of everything in its path. I've seen it, felt its poisoned breath on my skin.  Just like Vietnam, a hollow victory, a quagmire of blood and broken promises. \n\nThey thought they could simply pick a new king, install their own kind of order.  They didn't understand. It's not that simple. You can't stitch democracy onto a land steeped in ancient grievances, in the bitter dust of generations lost. The echoes of their failures in Vietnam, they clung to them like ghosts.\n\nThey said it would be quick, a surge and then a withdrawal. A swift tide, in and out, leaving behind a cleansed shore. But the tide turned, the water receded, leaving behind a wasteland.  \n\nThe bodies piled up, young men, sons, husbands, fathers, all for a lie, all for a promise that withered on the wind. And the people, the ones they swore to liberate, they became the enemy.  \n\nNo, it wasn't a glorious crusade. It was a slow, burning hell, fueled by greed and fear, by the insatiable hunger for power. And the ghosts, the ghosts of those lost, they whisper in the wind. They whisper of a land forever scarred, of promises broken, of a war that never truly ended.",
            "The words caught in his throat, a knot of heat and ash.  He cleared it, raspy. \"I'm... I'm for it. Always have been.\" He fumbled for the right words, the words that wouldn't betray the conviction that bloomed in his chest. \"It's a matter of... choice. It's in the blood, see? Not some damn social fad. You can't legislate desire, can't legislate who a man loves.\"\n\nHe looked out across the barren landscape, a wasteland of dust and broken dreams. \"To take that away, to deny them the same rights... it's inhumane. Like watching a bird with a clipped wing, forced to crawl.\"\n\nHe thought of the families on his street, the ones who lived in the shadow of what they couldn't have. \"Just regular folks, trying to live their lives. Walking their dogs, laughing in the sun. Same as anyone else.\"  \n\nHe felt the anger rise, hot and bitter. \"Bush, playing God... twisting the meaning of marriage to fit his own damn agenda. It's a personal thing, a matter between two souls. Not some holy relic for the state to claim.\"\n\nThe silence stretched, heavy and oppressive. He tried to find the words again, to articulate the truth that burned in his gut. \"Science is catching up. They're finding out, proving it... this isn't a choice. It's a part of who you are, wired into your very being.\" He paused, his voice raw. \"You can't un-love someone, just like you can't un-see the sky.\"",
            "The world’s a hard, barren place. Words, they stick to the bones, like ash on a shroud. You fling somethin’ out into the ether,  onto the endless web, and it’s gone past recall. It hangs there, a ghost in the machine, for everyone to see. \n\nFolks, they get spooked easy. Whispers, they gather like smoke, twisting and turning into somethin’ monstrous. They see a flicker in the dark, a word or two on a screen, and their minds, they fill in the blanks with somethin’ terrible.  \n\nThis ain’t no time for games. Violence, it ain’t a joke.  It ain’t a way to get attention. It’s a stain, a wound that bleeds onto the world.\n\nPeople, they gotta take it seriously. They saw what happened at the school. Heard the whispers, saw the words etched in digital blood. They couldn’t just stand by and watch.\n\nBut sometimes, the line blurs.  What’s real, what’s just a child’s frantic cry in the night? A test gone wrong, or somethin’ dark and festering?\n\nThe world, it’s a brittle thing. A whisper, it can turn into a scream. A joke, it can become a nightmare.\n\nYou can’t control what people think, what they make of what you leave behind. You put it out there, it owns you. It owns them all.",
            "The war. A sickness that festers. A wound that won't close.  It began with a purpose, they said. Democracy. A righteous cause. To free a people from a tyrant's grip. But the seasons turned, the years bled into one another, and the purpose, like a paper flag, grew brittle and faded.  \n\nMaybe the reasons weren't pure from the start. Shadows in the past, whispers of old scores between men in high places. A game of chess played on a board of blood.\n\nBut even if the first move was righteous, the play has gone on too long. The world watches, a silent audience to a spectacle of futility. The echoes of victory faded long ago, swallowed by the dust of the desert.\n\nA year.  Decades.  The numbers blur. The cost, measured in lives and coin, a ledger that stretches to infinity.  \n\nWhat was gained? What was lost?  \n\nThe sons of men, sent to kill and be killed, their faces etched with the weariness of endless sand and sun. They fight for something intangible, a phantom of purpose.\n\nThe cities lie in ruin, their bones picked clean. The air hangs thick with the scent of death and regret.\n\nIt's a drain on the soul, a hemorrhage of the spirit. \n\nThere's a time to fight. And there's a time to walk away. To heal. To rebuild.\n\nThis war has lasted too long. It's time to go home.",
            "The boy spoke. A question, a tremor in his voice.  He wanted to know if it was okay, if it was right, if someone looking at him online, taking in his words, his pictures,  was an invasion.\n\n\"Myspace,\" he said.  \"They say it's private. But...\" \n\nHe trailed off, the unspoken question hanging in the air.  Like a cloud bank, heavy with doubts.\n\nI told him it was a fair question.  A question spun from the want to be seen, to be known, but also from the fear of being seen too much.  \n\n\"If you put something out there,\" I said, \"it's got a way of finding its way. Like water seeking a valley. Like smoke, it drifts, it spreads.\"\n\nHe nodded, his brow furrowed. I told him about the times, long ago, when folks used to whisper on the wind. How their words carried on the breeze, sometimes landing in ears they weren't meant for.  The internet was like that, only louder, faster, a storm of whispers on a wire.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"if someone's looking, they're looking for something. Like a hunter, they're tracking. And sometimes, in that tracking, they find what they need to stop something bad from happening.\"\n\nHe looked at me, his eyes wide.  He wanted to believe that.\n\nI told him it was a hard balance. The right to be seen, the right to be known, and the right to be left alone.  A dance on a knife's edge. \n\nWe sat there, the silence thick with the weight of possibilities.  The boy's question hung in the air, unanswered, yet somehow, in the asking, it had already found its own kind of answer.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, a stifling silence punctuated only by the rasp of breath. He spoke, but the words tasted like ash in his mouth.  \"Hypocritical,\" he muttered, the word a shard of glass in the stillness.  To speak of it now, to join the chorus of dissent, felt like a betrayal of some unspoken pact. He hated the notion of bandwagoning, of preaching to the choir. But the truth was a thing that gnawed at him, a dark, persistent hunger.\n\nIt had been a bad idea from the start, a folly writ large across the arid landscape of Iraq.  The polls were damning, a chorus of voices – Iraqi, American, global – all echoing the same lament. Seventy-five, eighty percent, drowning in a sea of regret. The men who bled on that cursed ground, soldiers bound by duty, even they saw the futility, yearned for the solace of home.\n\nHe remembered the weight of the news, the slow, inexorable drip of horror, the faces of the dead, the ghosts that haunted the airwaves. A disaster from the outset, a wound that festered and refused to heal. Pulling out was its own agony, a slow, agonizing death throe. The Middle East, a land steeped in ancient rites and whispered secrets, a place where sand swallowed dreams and shadows danced with demons. To impose a foreign will upon it, to force a mold that didn't fit, was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n\nSaddam, a tyrant, a monster, no doubt. But what was the cost of vengeance? Was it worth the blood spilled, the lives shattered, the echoes of sorrow that reverberated across the ages? The weight of history pressed down upon him, the stench of war a heavy shroud.\n\nHe longed for a simpler time, for the days when the world seemed less fraught, less poisoned. A day spent with his uncle, the quiet rhythm of oars against water, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. A day etched in memory, a fleeting moment of grace in a world consumed by darkness.\n\nNow, the future stretched before him, a desolate landscape, barren and unforgiving.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  There was a time, he reckoned, when the world breathed different. Now, it choked.  He felt it in his bones, this gnawing ache of a place forgetting how to live.  \n\nYes, he knew.  He knew the world still clung to its old ways, its stories half-told, its truths buried under layers of expectation.  A man, he thought,  should be the provider. A woman, the keeper of the hearth.  These were the echoes he heard, not just in the rustle of the wind, but in the whispers of men's eyes, in the furrow of a woman's brow.  \n\nHe saw it in the way a woman with ambition was met with doubt, in the way a man who chose to stay home with his children was looked upon with suspicion.  The world, he thought,  held these things close, like secrets whispered in the dark. \n\nHe remembered a time, long ago, when he sat with his uncle by the shore of a still lake.  They hauled in bleached logs from the water, the silence broken only by the slap of oars and the rasp of their calls.  The sun bled across the water, painting the trees in shades of gold and crimson.  It was a day etched in memory, a day of quiet understanding.  But even then, a shadow lurked.  His uncle, a man of few words, would puff on his pipe, his gaze steady on the horizon.  He’d seen things, the old man, things that left a scar on the soul.\n\nNow, the world was a canvas of ash and gray, the colors drained away by a slow, creeping despair.  The air itself felt heavy, laden with the weight of unspoken truths. And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that the fight for equality was far from over.",
            "The air hung thick with the smoke of burnt things. Not trees this time. Buildings. A city choked by dust and ash. They moved through the skeletal remains, the wind whispering through the empty windows like ghosts. He kept the boy close, a shadow in his wake. The boy asked, \"Are we going to die?\" The question hung in the air, a tendril of fear. \"Not now,\" he said, his voice rough. \"We're going south.\"\n\nDecriminalized, they called it. Like a cough, a mere nuisance to be endured. But the stain remained. The fear. The stigma. A whisper in the ear, a shadow on the soul. They passed a carcass of a car, its metal skin twisted and charred. A skull, bleached white, stared vacantly from the interior.  He felt a tug at his hand, the boy's small fingers clutching his. \"What's that?\" he whispered, pointing. A wordless question. He looked down at the boy, his face streaked with ash, eyes wide with a terror that mirrored his own.\n\n\"Just the wind,\" he lied, his voice hollow. \"The wind that carries the ashes.\" He wanted to tell him, to explain the things he didn't understand, the things he couldn't bear to confront. But the words were trapped in his throat, choked by the dust.\n\nHe thought of the lake, the old man in his straw hat, their oars slicing through the black water. A memory, a ghost of a warmth, a world before the ashes. He wished he could  hold onto it, but the wind stole it away, leaving behind only the bitter taste of smoke and the echo of a question: What was left of their world, what was left of them?\n\nThey walked on, the boy's hand still clutching his, two figures swallowed by the grayness.",
            "The world is a hard place. Even the good things, they can bruise you. Like this talk of tradition. It binds you, keeps you in your place. A good thing, maybe, if the place is right. But what if the world shifts? The ground cracks beneath you. This church, it's like an old house built on a fault line. Solid, sure. But the walls are thin, the foundation crumbles.  \n\nThey say, be rooted. Be steadfast. But the wind, it blows. And sometimes the roots give way. You feel it in the marrow. A coldness. A doubt.\n\nThey talk about rules, about following the path. But what if the path is leading to a dead end? What if the light at the end of the tunnel is just a flicker, a dying ember?\n\nMy father, he was different. Not of this church. Not of their way. And they turned their backs on him. On us. They say love is the answer. But love can't heal a broken heart. Love can't bridge the chasm of their judgment. It can't rebuild what they tore down. \n\nThey speak of perfection. But who among us is perfect? We are all cracked and flawed. We stumble, we fall.  We bleed. And they, they wear their judgments like armor, impenetrable, unforgiving. \n\nThey preach of acceptance. But who are they to accept or reject? They are not God. They are just men, cloaked in piety, their hands stained with hypocrisy.",
            "The weight of it pressed down. This question, this knot in the country's gut. Right and wrong, shadows stretched thin in the face of it. A line drawn in the dust, blurred by the wind.  Separation, church and state, a fragile thing, fraying at the edges. Marriage. What was it? A sacrament, a pact, a contract? \n\nHe squinted at the worn road ahead, dust devils swirling in the air.  Two souls bound, a union. Was it the state's business to define it?  To bless it? To tax it?  Like a baptism, a walk through holy water, a spiritual thing.  But the government, they saw it differently. Dollars and cents, a legal document.   \n\nHe thought of the old preacher, fire in his eyes, speaking of sin and salvation. Thought of the young couple, eyes locked, vows whispered. Two lives entwined.  And the others, same desire, same yearning, but denied the same right.  A hollow ache in the chest.\n\nCivil union. The words hung in the air, a compromise, a step towards something but not quite enough. Two people, bound together, a love that defied definition. Should the government dictate the terms of a heart's desire?\n\nHe looked up at the sky, vast and indifferent. This was the crux of the matter, wasn't it?  A battle fought on a battlefield of beliefs, a clash of cultures, a tearing of the fabric of society.  He didn't have the answers, only the questions.  But he knew this: to deny a love, a commitment, a bond, was to deny a part of the human experience.\n\nOne law for all, he thought, the old whisper echoing in his mind. A level playing field, a shared destiny.  A hope, a dream, a prayer. Maybe, just maybe, that's what they were all striving for.",
            "The world, he reckoned, was a weight on the soul. A gray stone pressing down, a burden carried from birth. And some things, like the sun setting in the west, were just the way they were. You couldn't fight it. Couldn't change it. So you lived with it. You carried it.\n\nHe'd been raised in a house where the Lord's word was law. Where men were men and women were women. And some things, like that,  just seemed right. Natural. But the world was changing. Shifting. And words like \"homosexuality,\" they felt foreign, like a sickness in the air.  \n\nHe knew some boys, good boys, who were different. And he felt a kind of pity for them, a sadness. Like watching a sparrow with a broken wing. He didn't want to judge. But he couldn't quite understand. It was a river he couldn't cross, a canyon too deep to bridge. He believed in God’s law. But he also believed in freedom. In men choosing their own paths.\n\nThe question, though, it gnawed at him. Did the Lord want it this way? Was it a sin? Or a choice? And who was he to say?  He felt like a man standing on the edge of something vast and unknown. The answers, they were whispers in the wind, lost in the dust of a dying world.\n\nHe thought of states like cities, each with its own laws, its own ways. Some open, some closed. Some welcoming, some hostile.  Maybe that was the way it should be. Each place deciding its own fate.  \n\nHe thought of the President, his face on a screen, his voice booming.  A man in a distant place making decisions that touched every corner of the land.  Did he know the cost of his words? The weight of their burden?\n\nNo, he thought. He didn't. \n\nHe just knew one thing. He couldn't let the world's darkness swallow him whole.  He had to hold onto what he knew, what he believed. And he had to hope that in the end, the light would find its way back.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the taste of dust and ash clinging to the back of his throat. He stared out at the road, a ribbon of gray winding through the skeletal remains of a forgotten world. The boy sat beside him, wrapped in a threadbare blanket, eyes fixed on the endless horizon. He knew what the boy was thinking.  They were lost. They were alone. And the road stretched before them, a barren testament to some long-gone catastrophe.\n\n\"Do you think we'll find anyone?\" the boy finally asked, his voice barely a whisper against the wind that snaked through the skeletal trees.\n\nThe man looked at him, his face etched with the weariness of a journey that had lasted too long. \"There might be,\" he said, the words rough and hollow. \"But maybe it's best if we don't.\"\n\nThe boy frowned, the crease deepening in his brow. \"Why?\"\n\nThe man didn't answer. He didn't have an answer. He just kept his gaze fixed on the road, searching for something, anything, that might offer a glimmer of hope in this desolate landscape. \n\nThey had been moving for what felt like an eternity, ever since the fire swept through their home, leaving behind only ash and silence. He carried the boy close, the weight of his small body a constant reminder of the precious life he was sworn to protect. \n\nHe remembered a time when the world had been different, a time when laughter echoed through the streets and the air was clean and sweet. But those memories were fading, swallowed up by the encroaching darkness that seemed to be consuming everything.\n\nHe tightened his grip on the pistol tucked into his belt, a cold comfort against the gnawing fear that coiled in his gut. There were dangers out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting to prey on the weak and the vulnerable. He had to keep the boy safe. He had to.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his face pale and drawn. The boy's eyes were wide and filled with a fear that mirrored his own. \n\n\"We'll be alright,\" he whispered, his voice hoarse. \"We'll be alright.\"\n\nBut even as he said the words, he wasn't sure if he believed them.",
            "The war. A sickness in the gut, that's what it was. At first, yes, the fire in the belly burned hot. Nine-Eleven. It ripped a hole in the sky, in the soul, and the rage spilled out.  Like a hawk, talons bared, ready to strike.  But the hawk forgets the cost of its fury.  We went in blind, eyes glazed over with grief and vengeance. No plan for the aftermath, just the need to bring the fire to those who dared touch the nest. \n\nAnd now? The fire has burned out, leaving only ash and hollowness.  The enemy's a shadow, a whisper in the wind. They fight amongst themselves, a pack of dogs tearing at scraps. Does it matter?  We throw stones, but the stones only splinter and scatter.\n\nThey're not like us. Their war is a different beast, a primal hunger. We brought them iron and steel, but they met it with blood and bone. We spoke of freedom, of democracy, but they heard only the clang of steel and the stench of death. \n\nWe went in for revenge, and found only more pain. We sought to build, but the ground was choked with rubble.  \n\nThe boy asked me once, \"Will we ever go home?\" I didn't know then. Don't know now.  We are lost in this labyrinth of dust and blood, searching for an exit that may not exist.\n\nThe truth is, we don't belong there. We brought the storm, but we cannot control the wind. We are strangers in a strange land, condemned to walk the wasteland until the dust settles and the echoes of our folly fade away."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, she needs to change.  That much is plain.  They talk of losing their flock, these men in their black robes, and the reason ain't hard to see. They hold fast to things, to ways of thinking older than the dust on these worn-out roads.  The world turns, but they stand rigid, their faces etched in stone.\n\nTake marriage, for instance. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, they say it ain't right. They cling to a scripture older than the hills, a book of stories told in firelight, a time when the world was young and different. And what of a woman's right to choose?  The body, a vessel, a thing to be controlled.  Birth control, a sin. Abortion, a stain. These are the things they preach, these are the things that drive folks away, like smoke from a dying fire.\n\nThis ain't new. I've heard the whispers, the voices murmuring in the shadows. They say the Church stands on a foundation cracked and crumbling. The old ways no longer hold sway.  The wind of change is blowing, and the Church, she stands against it, her roots dug deep in the ground, blind to the storm gathering on the horizon.\n\n\nThey say the Church is against abortion.  A woman's choice, they say, is a sin.  But what of the woman, what of her burden, her pain?  Is she not a soul, a being worthy of compassion?\n\nAnd the gays, the ones who love each other, who seek only to share their lives in the light of day. They are deemed an abomination, a stain on the fabric of God's creation.  They are cast out, ostracized, their love branded a sin.\n\nI don't see it that way.  I see two souls, bound together by a love as real and true as any other.  Why should they be denied the simple right to happiness? \n\nThey say priests should be celibate, devoted solely to God.  But what of the man who yearns for companionship, for the warmth of another soul?  Does God not wish for his children to find joy and fulfillment in this life, in love and connection? \n\nThis ain't a matter of doctrine or scripture.  It's a matter of the heart, of compassion, of understanding.  The Church needs to open her eyes, to see the world as it is, not as it was.   The world is changing, and the Church, if she wants to survive, must change with it.",
            "The boy sat across from him, eyes wide and fixed. \"Do you think,\" he said, voice small, \"that some things are just the way they are?\" \n\nThe man stared into the distance, his gaze fixed on the dull gray horizon. Dust motes danced in the sliver of light that pierced the gloom. \"Maybe,\" he said, his voice rough and low. \"Maybe some things are just the way they are.\"\n\n\"Like...\" the boy hesitated, searching for the right words. \"Like...love?\"\n\nThe man turned his head slowly, a shadow of a smile flickering across his face. \"Love,\" he echoed, the word hanging heavy in the silence. \"Love is a hard thing to pin down.\"  He gestured vaguely towards the vast emptiness that stretched before them. \"This world,\" he said, \"it's full of things that can't be explained.\"\n\nThe boy considered this for a long moment, chewing on the end of a stray thread on his worn blanket. \"So it's okay,\" he said finally, \"if people love people, even if it's not...the way they're supposed to?\"\n\nThe man looked at him then, his eyes filled with a strange tenderness. \"Maybe,\" he repeated, his voice softer now. \"Maybe it's just okay.\"",
            "The boy looked up at the man, his eyes pale and watchful in the dust-choked light. \"Should we?\" he asked, voice thin.\n\n\"Should we what?\" the man said, his gaze fixed on the road stretching out before them, a ribbon of gray against the ashen landscape.\n\n\"Should we like... marry?\"\n\nThe man shifted the weight of the knapsack on his shoulder, the worn canvas creaking. \"Marry? Why?\"\n\n\"Just like... everyone else.\"\n\n\"Everyone else,\" the man echoed, the words tasting bitter on his tongue. \"They ain't got nothin' to teach us, son. Not anymore.\" \n\nThe boy frowned. \"But it means... somethin', don't it?\" He looked around at the desolate landscape, the skeletal trees clawing at the gray sky. \"Something good.\"\n\nThe man said nothing for a long time, just stared at the road. Then he looked down at the boy, his face lined and weathered like a piece of old leather. \"This ain't a world for good things, son,\" he said. \"Not anymore. This world's for survival.\"\n\n\"But... what if it could be different?\" the boy persisted, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nThe man touched the boy's shoulder gently, his hand calloused and rough. \"We'll see,\" he said, his voice low and uncertain. \"We'll see.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence stretching between them like a shroud. The wind whispered through the ash-covered trees, carrying with it the faint scent of something dying.",
            "The air hung thick with the smell of sickness and dust. The pharmacy, a fluorescent-lit cage, hummed with a low, constant thrum. He glanced at the vials lining the shelves, the rows of pills, the brightly colored labels.  \"Just because something is outlawed,\" he said, his voice rasping, \"doesn't mean it has no use.\" He spoke slowly, picking his words carefully. \"There's a kind of shadow cast on it, a fear. A lie.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy, pale and thin, coughing in the next room. A cough that clawed at his insides, a cough that the pills couldn't touch. He thought of the whispers in the hallways, the hushed tones, the judging eyes. They called it a devil's weed, a poison, a gateway. But he knew better. He'd seen the way it could ease the pain, the way it could bring a moment of peace.\n\n\"They lock it away,\" he continued, \"but it grows wild, untamed. It's there in the alleys, in the shadows, in the minds of those who dare to seek it.\"\n\nHe saw the boy's face, the fear in his eyes, the desperation. He knew what it was to be trapped, to be sick, to be alone. He knew the hunger for relief, the yearning for a sliver of solace. And he knew that sometimes, the only solace could be found in the darkness. \n\n\"It's not a monster,\" he whispered, his voice barely audible above the hum of the fluorescent lights. \"It's a whisper, a promise. A possibility.\"\n\nHe looked back at the shelves, at the rows of pills, at the faces of those he served. And he wondered, how many more would they condemn before they learned the truth?",
            "The church, it's changed. Softened. Not the hard-edged institution it used to be. I remember, back when I was a child, Sunday was a ritual.  Matching dress, shoes, purse – all of it pressed and prim.  Every Sunday, same parade. Private school, friends all there, faces scrubbed clean.  But now, they've got this \"teen mass\" - thirty minutes, tops. People come in stained shorts, dripping sand from the beach.  Families burst in late, like they're doing the church a favor by showing up at all. Even the morning masses, where I used to stand stiff and proper in my best clothes, now folks are in jeans and khakis. Khakis ain't bad, but it's...casual. \n\nThat's the thing, I guess. The church is more casual now.  \n\nI don't know if that's good or bad.  About those priests, those accusations...I don't think it matters if they were married or not. Some men, they're just broken.  It ain't about the vows, it's the darkness inside. Like in those old stories, the ones with the monsters lurking in the woods.  They're already there.  Marriage wouldn't change that.  \n\nMaybe it's a different kind of faith they need, one where they can find peace without the church's walls.",
            "The dust rose like a wraith. September, they called it. But the air held the chill of some perpetual November.  He remembered, though, the day the towers fell. A day the sky itself seemed to bleed. And the lies that flowed from the mouths of men in suits, the promises whispered like prayers. They spoke of Bin Laden, of weapons, of a righteous war. But the blood tasted of ash in his mouth, the kind that choked the light from the world.\n\nHe thought of Powell, his voice a hollow echo in that grand hall, laying out the evidence, the weight of the world on his shoulders. A man who, even then, knew the truth was a flickering candle in a storm.  A man forced to be a shepherd to lies.\n\nThe word \"malfeasance\" hung in the air, a brittle thing. An impeachable offense, they called it.  But what good are words when they are swallowed by the dust? When power is a hungry beast, and truth a forgotten prayer?\n\nThe younger Bush, he saw it in his eyes. A thirst, a hunger for something more than justice. A hunger for vengeance, for dominion, for oil-stained promises.  \n\nHe thought of the lake, his father’s weathered face, the creaking of the oars cutting through the silence. A different kind of war, fought in the stillness of the water, the smell of pine needles and damp earth. A war where the enemy was not a man, but a shadow, a memory.\n\nNow, the air tasted of smoke and despair. The whispers of the wind carried the echoes of gunfire, the cries of children lost in the dust.  And he wondered, with a cold certainty, if this was the legacy they would leave for the world. A legacy of ash and blood, a world where the only truth was the weight of the silence.",
            "The air hung thick, a gauze of ash clinging to the tongue. The boy spoke, voice a rasp in the stillness. \"I done.\" \n\n\"Mmhmm.\" \n\nA pause, the sound of rustling plastic, then a hesitant question. \"Just talk into it?\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"Ok, cool.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"Uh.\" The boy's voice trailed off, a sigh escaping his lips. \"Ok, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"How I feel about the War in Iraq...\"\n\nHe scratched at the stubble on his jaw, a long, weary sigh escaping him.  \"Let me see... um...\" \n\nHe swallowed, the words catching in his throat like grit. \"At this point, it feels pointless. I mean, it ain't even a real war, not officially. Just a... payback thing. Like we figured out who did it – those folks who hit us on nine-eleven.\"\n\nHe looked out, his gaze lost in the gray distance.  \"I don't follow it much, the War in Iraq.  Don't know the details.  But it feels like we're hanging on, trying to build some kind of democracy there. Make it another... American thing.\"  \n\nHe spat on the ground, a bitter taste in his mouth. \"And maybe grab some oil while we're at it. But it ain't right, all this anger, all this fighting. It ain't solving anything.\"\n\nHe looked down at his hands, calloused and worn. \"And building democracy... that takes time, a whole lot of time.  You can't just force it. And if we just walk away, well...\"  \n\nHe shook his head, the words catching in his throat again. \"They'll be mad, rightfully so. We'll have messed things up, left them to clean up the mess. It's a damned catch-22.\" \n\nHis voice dropped to a whisper. \"This whole thing... it's a damn hard one.\"",
            "The preacher's words, they hung in the air like the smoke from a dying fire.  Something ain't right.  Something ain't right about this whole damn business. It's a house of worship, a house of God, and the law got no business poking its nose in. That's what the old book says, right there. Separation of church and state. Plain as day.  They're tryin' to force their will on folks, their own brand of righteousness, and that's not the way of things. \n\nIt ain't about what some folks in Boston or up in them fancy cities think. It's about what's in the heart. What's in the soul. And that ain't for the government to decide. It's for the good Lord to judge.  This whole amendment business, it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.  They say it's about protecting the people, but it's about  control. It's about silencing dissent.\n\nThe government, they ain't got no right to tell the churches what to do.  They ain't got no right to tell us what to believe.  It's a slippery slope, this whole thing. Where does it end? What's next, they tellin' us what to eat? What to wear? Who to love?\n\nThis here's America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. And we ain't gonna stand for this kind of tyranny.",
            "The air hung thick with ash, a curtain drawn over the land. A silence hung too, heavier than the dust, broken only by the rasp of the wind through the skeletal trees. He tasted it on his tongue, the grit of the dead world.  The war, they'd called it. A righteousness wrapped in lies, a whispered promise of swift justice. But it was a slow burn, this thing they'd wrought. A festering wound on the face of the earth.\n\nHe couldn't speak its name. The word tasted like copper and bile in his mouth.  It was a dog's growl, a child's whimper, a strangled cry. It was the echo of boots on ash, the ghosts of laughter choked by smoke.\n\nThey had said it was about freedom, about bringing democracy to a land of shadows. But freedom tasted like dust, and democracy was a fragile bloom in this barren landscape.  It was a lie told over and over, a story spun to mask the hunger in the hearts of men.\n\nThey had promised a quick victory, a swift ending to the nightmare. But victory tasted like ashes, like the bitter tang of grief. And the nightmare stretched on, a tapestry woven with blood and bone.\n\nHe looked at the boy, his face creased with weariness, eyes haunted by the emptiness of the world. They were both ghosts, they were both adrift in this wasteland.  The boy, he was the only thing that kept him tethered to the remnants of humanity. The only reason to keep walking, to keep searching for a flicker of hope in the endless gray.\n\nHe thought of the lakes he used to fish in, the woods where he used to hunt, the laughter of children playing in the streets. \n\nThey were gone now, swallowed by the dust and the silence.  \n\nHe would fight for the boy, he would fight for the memory of what they had lost. He would fight until his last breath. \n\nBut even in his heart, a cold fear took root.\n\nWhat if there was nothing left to fight for?  What if the world had already been consumed by the ashes?",
            "He spoke slow, his words catching like windblown leaves in the dry brush.  \"It's somethin' personal, this. Always been. A matter of the heart, like a vein runnin' wrong.  A twist in the blood.\" He paused, thumbing a worn spot on his worn sleeve.  \"Can't legislate that, can you? Can't make a man's soul sing to another man's soul if it ain't meant to be. It's deeper than that, see?  The books, the preachers, they say it's a choice.  But I ask you, can you choose the sun to rise in the east? Can you choose the way the wind whispers through the pines?\"\n\nHe spat a wad of tobacco juice into the dust. \"It's wrong, plain wrong, to deny a man the right to love, to build a life with another.  Just because some folks can't understand it, shouldn't mean they get to take it away.\"\n\nHis voice, low and rumbling, echoed in the vast emptiness around them. \"I see it in my neighborhood.  Folks livin' their lives, just like any other. Walkin' their dogs, tendin' their gardens, shapin' their little worlds.  Why should they be less?  Why should they have to hide?\"\n\nHe shook his head, the motion slow and weary. \"It ain't about God, not really. It's about fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of what they don't understand.  It's a sickness, that fear. It eats away at the heart, leaves nothin' but bitterness in its wake.\"  \n\n\nHe sighed, the sound a gust of wind through dry bones.  \"Let 'em try to legislate love, I say. Let 'em try to box it in, to control it. It'll just keep growin',  stronger, wilder.  Love always finds a way.\"",
            "The boy spoke, voice thin as a wire in the dead air.  \"You put somethin' on the internet, it's out there. Open road. Can't take it back.\"\n\nThe words hung, heavy as ash, in the silence.  A truth the boy knew in his bones, a truth etched in the dust and bone of the ravaged world. \"It's a public square,\" he went on, \"a gossip well that never runs dry. Say somethin' loud enough, someone's gonna hear.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy's question, the one that had followed them like a shadow across the scorched plains. \"What if you talk 'bout... blowin' things up?\" he'd asked. \"What if you talk 'bout shootin'?\"\n\nA grim smile tugged at the man's lips. \"Someone's gonna take notice.  And they'll act. Gotta act. Can't just leave it hangin' like a crows nest in the wind.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, small skull tilted, eyes dark as the empty sky. \"Like the school,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Like the school,\" the man agreed.\n\nHe remembered the whisperings, the fear that had crawled through the halls like a starved dog.  The boy's words, his innocence, a flickering candle in the encroaching dark.  \"It could be a joke,\" the man had said then. \"Some kid messin' around.\"\n\nBut the words lingered, a poison seed planted in fertile ground.  Someone heard. Someone saw.  And the world shifted, tilted on its axis.\n\n\"They gotta check,\" the man said now, voice gravelly from dust and despair. \"Can't ignore it.  Can't let it fester.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, eyes filled with a weariness beyond years. \"But,\" he added, \"you gotta be careful what you plant.\"\n\nThe boy looked down, fiddling with a loose thread on his ragged shirt. \"Can't control what people think,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"No,\" the man agreed. \"But you can control your words.  They're the seeds you sow.\"\n\nThe wind howled through the skeletal trees, a mournful lament for a world gone silent.  The sun, a pale ghost in the sky, offered no warmth, no hope.\n\nOnly the ashes.",
            "The war. It stretched on like a bad dream, a wound that wouldn't close.  At first, the purpose felt right, clear. To bring democracy to a land choked by iron. But somewhere along the way, the light had dimmed. Now it felt like a hunger, a need to prove something, to show the world the weight of our power.  \n\nThe motives, even then, felt muddy. Whispers of old scores, of debts owed and favors sought, lingered like smoke. The son of a man who'd tangled with that Saddam Hussein before, a puppet master pulling strings from afar.  \n\nDemocracy, a fine ideal. But the thirst for it had gone sour, the taste of it turned bitter. It seemed we'd made our point in the first blood-soaked months. The world had seen. Heard.  But the hammering went on. Years bled into years, the years bleeding into the young men whose lives were spilled on that arid ground. \n\nWe were fighting to win, to prove something, though what that something was, nobody seemed to say any more.  It felt like a bad habit, a sickness we couldn't shake.\n\nBillions spent, for what?  While our own cities crumbled, our own people starved. Poverty gnawed at the edges of our society, education withered, and healthcare became a luxury.\n\nWe were bleeding ourselves dry for a cause that had lost its way, a phantom in the desert wind.  It was time to stop. Time to let the desert sand claim its own. Time to turn our backs on the ghosts of tyrants and bring our sons home.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of ash and dust. He spoke, voice low, almost a rasp.  \"It's a question, ain't it? About the line we walk. What's seen, what's hidden.\" He paused, fingers tracing a worn groove in the table, the plastic worn smooth by time and weather. \"They say the world's wide open, everything laid out for the taking on them there computers. But is it truly open? Or is it just another kind of cage?\" He looked up, eyes shadowed, a storm gathering behind them.  \"You put something out there, even a word, a picture, and it ain't yours anymore, is it?\" \n\nHe shook his head slowly, letting the question hang in the air. \"This boy, this boy nearly slipped through the cracks. Someone saw, someone cared. Maybe that's the world we're cursed with now, a world where every shadow's watched, every breath a whisper in the wind. We think we're free, but the truth is, we're all just players in a vast, unending game. And the rules, well, they're changing faster than the desert wind.\"\n\nHe fell silent, staring into the dying embers of the fire. \"Is it right? Is it wrong? These questions, they gnaw at you, don't they? But the answers, they're buried deep, maybe deeper than we can find them.\"",
            "The air hung thick, a silence choked by dust and ash. Words, like brittle leaves, skittered across the barren landscape of his mind.  He knew what he had to say, what the world needed to hear. But the words, they wouldn't come easy. Not clean, not sharp.  They tangled, snagged on the barbs of doubt and the ghosts of a war fought in shadows long gone.\n\n\"It's a lie,\" he rasped, the sound catching in his throat like gravel. \"A goddamn lie.\"  \n\nHe felt a kinship with the ghosts of those who had come before, those who had fought and died on battlefields stripped bare, their voices swallowed by the endless wind. \"They say it was for freedom,\" he continued, his voice a low growl, \"for democracy. But freedom's a brittle thing, a whisper lost in the canyons of a dying land.\"\n\nHe traced the lines of his palm, the map of a life etched in hardship and sorrow. \"They don't understand,\" he muttered, his gaze fixed on the unforgiving horizon. \"They sit in their ivory towers, blind to the blood spilled in the name of their ambitions.\"\n\nThe statistics, they meant nothing. The numbers, cold and clinical, couldn't capture the weight of loss, the echoes of screams swallowed by the desert night. \n\n\"Eighty percent, they say,\" he croaked, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. \"Eighty percent of the world knows it was a mistake. But what good are numbers when faced with the desolate truth?\"\n\nHe looked up, his eyes searching the endless expanse, a plea for understanding lost in the swirling dust. \"There's no victory in this land,\" he whispered, his voice ragged with despair. \"Only the bitter taste of ash and the ghosts of broken promises.\"",
            "The air hung thick with it, this thing they called equality. A lie whispered in boardrooms, a ghost in the halls of power.  Women, they said, had come a long way. But the glass ceiling remained, a shimmering, unforgiving surface.  A man looking down might mistake it for clear sky, but those who climbed knew the truth. The weight of history pressed down, the echoes of an old world where a woman's place was in the home, her ambition stifled by societal expectations. \n\nIt wasn't just women, though. The fields of work, they had their own unforgiving borders.  A man at home with his children,  a shade of blue in a world of grays, faced scorn. \"The breadwinner,\" they called him, a title that stung like a branding iron.  \n\nAnd fashion, that world of spun silk and fleeting trends, it held its own prejudices. A man who dared to tread its paths, to speak of color and cut, was met with suspicion.  His words, twisted into doubts, his intentions questioned. \"A man in fashion?\" they'd sneer, \"Does he even know what women want?\"\n\nIt was a slow rot, this prejudice, ingrained in the very marrow of society.  But change, it came in whispers, in the quiet acts of defiance. A woman stepping into a boardroom, a man choosing to nurture instead of provide.  Slowly, the lines blurred, the borders softened. It was a long road, but every step counted.  One day, maybe, the world would see the truth: that strength came in all forms, that talent knew no gender, and that beauty resided not in conformity, but in the courage to be oneself.",
            "The talk was of laws, not of God. Decriminalization, they called it. A word like ash, settling on the tongue.  Not criminal, not anymore. More like a speeding ticket, a fine, a slap on the wrist. He'd heard the talk, the arguments: the cost of hauling men in, the weight of the courts, the drain on the treasury. Money, always money. A new kind of  poverty, a hunger for it.  But something else lingered beneath the talk, a shadow in the corners of the room. The fear, the whispers about jobs, about futures, about the stain that wouldn't wash. \n\nHe'd seen the way they looked at those marks, the way they clung to the old ways. Denver, they said, a haven. A place where the air was thin and the minds were open. Maybe. But even there, the smoke from the devil's herb hung heavy. A constant reminder of the things that lurked beneath the surface, the things that couldn't be spoken aloud. They decriminalized it, they said, but it still had teeth. Still held the power to bite. \n\nHe thought of his uncle, sitting in the old rowboat, the lake a mirror to the sky.  The silence between them, thick as the humid air.  The way his uncle watched the water, his eyes like old marbles, reflecting a world long gone.   They'd been silent, those days.  But he knew his uncle thought about it, about the things that were  unspeakable. The things that lingered in the corners of memory, the things that made the heart ache.",
            "The man sat, his gaze fixed on the dust motes dancing in the thin light filtering through the cracked windowpane. He shifted in his worn chair, the wood creaking a low protest. \"Yes,\" he said finally, his voice rough as gravel. \"Tradition. It's a weight, a thing you carry, a cloak that both warms and binds.\" He paused, his eyes drifting to the faded crucifix hanging crookedly on the wall. \"They say it's good, to be rooted. But the roots, they can strangle you too. They can keep you from seeing the world changing.\" \n\nHe sighed, the sound rasping in his chest. \"They cling to it, the old ways. The church, the rituals, the dogma. It's a fortress against the darkness, they say. But sometimes,\" he added, his voice dropping to a whisper, \"the darkness comes from within.\"\n\nHe looked up, his gaze lingering on the crucifix. \"They want you perfect, these people of the cloth. They want you to fold yourself into their mold, to fit the pattern. But there are cracks in the mold, fissures where the light breaks through. Where doubt takes root. And sometimes,\" he said, his voice hardening, \"those cracks are all that keep you sane.\"\n\n\nHe remembered his father, his face weathered and worn, his eyes filled with a quiet despair. He remembered the whispers in the shadows, the unspoken judgments. \"My father,\" he said, his voice barely audible, \"he was different. He didn't fit. They shunned him, they cast him out. And for what? For loving another, for daring to choose his own path?\"\n\nHe stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. \"It's hypocrisy, that's what it is. They preach love, but they build walls of exclusion. They speak of forgiveness, but they offer only judgment.\" He shook his head, his eyes filled with a weary anger. \"The world is changing, but they cling to the past. They're blind to the truth.\"\n\nHe walked to the window, his shadow stretching long and thin across the floor. \"The only truth,\" he said, his voice hollow, \"is in the heart. In the choices you make, the paths you choose. And sometimes, the hardest choice is to break free from the chains of tradition, to walk your own way, even if it leads you into the darkness.\"",
            "The line, it blurs. Church and state, a frayed seam in the fabric of this country. Two sides, locked in a dance, one foot on the altar, the other on the courthouse steps. Marriage, they say. A sacrament, they whisper.  A contract, they decree. But what's a contract but a promise, and what's a promise but a faith, a hope, a fragile thing in the face of this hard world?\n\nIt's a question that gnaws, a bone picked clean, leaving only the marrow of doubt.  Two bodies, bound. Two souls, entangled. The government, a cold judge, should it weigh in? Define this thing they call love, this thing that bleeds and births and breaks?\n\nBaptism, they say. A sacrament. But what of the unseen bonds, the ties that hold families together, the whispers of kinship that echo through generations? Should these be measured, weighed, cataloged by the state?  \n\nCivil unions, they say. A compromise. But is a contract a cradle, a haven?  Or just a cage, gilded but still a cage?  \n\nWhat of the love that cannot be contained, that spills over the edges of definition? It's a wildfire, a storm surge, a force beyond the grasp of law.  \n\nLet the states decide, some say. But what of the unity, the fabric of this nation, frayed by discord?  \n\nA constitutional amendment, a wall built to keep out the light. A monument to fear, not faith.  The constitution, it is a beacon, a promise of liberty, not a weapon to be wielded against the tender shoots of love.\n\nAmend it for a cause? For a fear? No.  Love isn't a battle to be fought, a cause to be won. It's a song, a whisper, a quiet truth that echoes in the chambers of the heart.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and ash.  The man spoke low, his words rasping like stones in a dry creek bed. \"Raised right, I was. Church every Sunday. Taught to believe. But these things, these… choices… they're a tangled thing, ain't they? Like a knot tied in a rope that won't come undone.\" \n\nHe shifted, the weight of the world settling on his shoulders. \"Friends I got, good friends, different.  I don't rightly say I understand it, this… this way of life. But they're my brothers, my kin.  Shouldn't be a sin, should it?  If two souls find peace in each other,  what right have we to judge?\"\n\nHis gaze drifted to the road ahead, a ribbon of dust winding through the desolate landscape. \"Each state, that's where it should be decided.  Let the people speak. Let them choose their own path, their own reckoning.  A man can't force his beliefs on another, no more than he can force the sun to rise in the west.\"\n\nHe spat a wad of tobacco into the dust. \"That man in Washington, he thinks he knows best, don't he?  But he ain't God.  He's a man, just like the rest of us, prone to error, to doubt, to fear.  Let the states decide.  Let it be a matter of conscience, not of decree.\"  \n\nHe fell silent, his eyes fixed on the horizon, a distant smudge of gray against the dying light. \"Some things,\" he murmured, \"are better left unsaid.  Some truths are too heavy to bear.\"",
            "The words hung there, half-formed, swallowed by the bleak silence. \"Public?\" he rasped, the word a brittle shard against the ash-grey landscape. \"Yeah, public. Like a billboard in the wasteland.\" A cough tore through him, a ragged rasp in the stillness.\n\n\"People seein' it, that's the point, ain't it?\" His gaze drifted across the sun-bleached expanse, where skeletal trees clawed at the leaden sky. \"They see your soul laid bare, your thoughts like vultures circling.\"\n\nHe shifted, the worn fabric of his coat whispering against his lean frame. \"School officials, they got a right, you think? To peek into your heart, see what's festerin' inside? Just 'cause they got a badge and a uniform?\"\n\nA long silence stretched, punctuated only by the wind's mournful sigh through the shattered branches. \"Maybe it's about safety,\" he finally muttered, his voice a dry whisper. \"Maybe they're lookin' for the storm clouds gatherin', the ones that might burst into fire.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, eyes shadowed and deep. \"But what if they find the wrong kind of storm? What if they think a dark thought is a threat, a whisper of rebellion a call to arms?\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his voice dropping to a low growl. \"They say everything you put out there stays out there. A ghost echoin' through the canyons of the internet. But what if they start huntin' ghosts? What if they start fearin' the shadows?\"\n\nHe looked back at the desolate landscape, his face etched with a weary resignation. \"Maybe they ain't savin' lives. Maybe they're just buryin' them deeper.\"",
            "The war. Nine Eleven.  The air hung thick with it then. Made a man want to pour oil on the fire, see it burn clean.  That's how I felt.  But now... now the ash settles. The smoke clears.  And you see the bones. \n\nWe went in like a fever, eyes glazed, hearts pounding.  Thought we'd strike the matches, set the world right.  Didn't stop to think about the wind.  Didn't think about where the sparks would fly.  Didn't think about the tinder, dry and waiting.   \n\nThey say chaos is a ladder, but in that place it was a tangled mess of roots, choking the light. We tried to prune it, carve order from the chaos.  But the more we cut, the more it bled.\n\nThey say you can't judge a people by their worst, but sometimes... sometimes the worst is all you see.  They fight amongst themselves, like wolves starving for scraps.  And you wonder, do they even know what it means to be human?\n\nMaybe that's the real mistake.  Going in there with our own measure of humanity, expecting it to fit.  It doesn't.  Their world is a different kind of darkness.  We brought our light, but it only burned brighter in the shadows.\n\nNow, the light fades.  The war drags on, a slow bleed.  We're losing ground, losing hope.  Maybe it's time to walk away.  Let the ashes settle.  Let the wind carry the whispers of what was.\n\nBut even in the silence, the ghosts of nine Eleven linger.  They'll stay with us, a shadow on the horizon, a reminder of the cost of anger, of the price of forgetting."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, she needs to change.  That much is plain.  They talk of losing their flock, these men in their black robes, and the reason ain't hard to see. They hold fast to things, to ways of thinking older than the dust on these worn-out roads.  The world turns, but they stand rigid, their faces etched in stone.\n\nTake marriage, for instance. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, they say it ain't right. They cling to a scripture older than the hills, a book of stories told in firelight, a time when the world was young and different. And what of a woman's right to choose?  The body, a vessel, a thing to be controlled.  Birth control, a sin. Abortion, a stain. These are the things they preach, these are the things that drive folks away, like smoke from a dying fire.\n\nThis ain't new. I've heard the whispers, the voices murmuring in the shadows. They say the Church stands on a foundation cracked and crumbling. The old ways no longer hold sway.  The wind of change is blowing, and the Church, she stands against it, her roots dug deep in the ground, blind to the storm gathering on the horizon.\n\n\nThey say the Church is against abortion.  A woman's choice, they say, is a sin.  But what of the woman, what of her burden, her pain?  Is she not a soul, a being worthy of compassion?\n\nAnd the gays, the ones who love each other, who seek only to share their lives in the light of day. They are deemed an abomination, a stain on the fabric of God's creation.  They are cast out, ostracized, their love branded a sin.\n\nI don't see it that way.  I see two souls, bound together by a love as real and true as any other.  Why should they be denied the simple right to happiness? \n\nThey say priests should be celibate, devoted solely to God.  But what of the man who yearns for companionship, for the warmth of another soul?  Does God not wish for his children to find joy and fulfillment in this life, in love and connection? \n\nThis ain't a matter of doctrine or scripture.  It's a matter of the heart, of compassion, of understanding.  The Church needs to open her eyes, to see the world as it is, not as it was.   The world is changing, and the Church, if she wants to survive, must change with it.",
            "The boy sat across from him, eyes wide and fixed. \"Do you think,\" he said, voice small, \"that some things are just the way they are?\" \n\nThe man stared into the distance, his gaze fixed on the dull gray horizon. Dust motes danced in the sliver of light that pierced the gloom. \"Maybe,\" he said, his voice rough and low. \"Maybe some things are just the way they are.\"\n\n\"Like...\" the boy hesitated, searching for the right words. \"Like...love?\"\n\nThe man turned his head slowly, a shadow of a smile flickering across his face. \"Love,\" he echoed, the word hanging heavy in the silence. \"Love is a hard thing to pin down.\"  He gestured vaguely towards the vast emptiness that stretched before them. \"This world,\" he said, \"it's full of things that can't be explained.\"\n\nThe boy considered this for a long moment, chewing on the end of a stray thread on his worn blanket. \"So it's okay,\" he said finally, \"if people love people, even if it's not...the way they're supposed to?\"\n\nThe man looked at him then, his eyes filled with a strange tenderness. \"Maybe,\" he repeated, his voice softer now. \"Maybe it's just okay.\"",
            "The boy looked up at the man, his eyes pale and watchful in the dust-choked light. \"Should we?\" he asked, voice thin.\n\n\"Should we what?\" the man said, his gaze fixed on the road stretching out before them, a ribbon of gray against the ashen landscape.\n\n\"Should we like... marry?\"\n\nThe man shifted the weight of the knapsack on his shoulder, the worn canvas creaking. \"Marry? Why?\"\n\n\"Just like... everyone else.\"\n\n\"Everyone else,\" the man echoed, the words tasting bitter on his tongue. \"They ain't got nothin' to teach us, son. Not anymore.\" \n\nThe boy frowned. \"But it means... somethin', don't it?\" He looked around at the desolate landscape, the skeletal trees clawing at the gray sky. \"Something good.\"\n\nThe man said nothing for a long time, just stared at the road. Then he looked down at the boy, his face lined and weathered like a piece of old leather. \"This ain't a world for good things, son,\" he said. \"Not anymore. This world's for survival.\"\n\n\"But... what if it could be different?\" the boy persisted, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nThe man touched the boy's shoulder gently, his hand calloused and rough. \"We'll see,\" he said, his voice low and uncertain. \"We'll see.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence stretching between them like a shroud. The wind whispered through the ash-covered trees, carrying with it the faint scent of something dying.",
            "The air hung thick with the smell of sickness and dust. The pharmacy, a fluorescent-lit cage, hummed with a low, constant thrum. He glanced at the vials lining the shelves, the rows of pills, the brightly colored labels.  \"Just because something is outlawed,\" he said, his voice rasping, \"doesn't mean it has no use.\" He spoke slowly, picking his words carefully. \"There's a kind of shadow cast on it, a fear. A lie.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy, pale and thin, coughing in the next room. A cough that clawed at his insides, a cough that the pills couldn't touch. He thought of the whispers in the hallways, the hushed tones, the judging eyes. They called it a devil's weed, a poison, a gateway. But he knew better. He'd seen the way it could ease the pain, the way it could bring a moment of peace.\n\n\"They lock it away,\" he continued, \"but it grows wild, untamed. It's there in the alleys, in the shadows, in the minds of those who dare to seek it.\"\n\nHe saw the boy's face, the fear in his eyes, the desperation. He knew what it was to be trapped, to be sick, to be alone. He knew the hunger for relief, the yearning for a sliver of solace. And he knew that sometimes, the only solace could be found in the darkness. \n\n\"It's not a monster,\" he whispered, his voice barely audible above the hum of the fluorescent lights. \"It's a whisper, a promise. A possibility.\"\n\nHe looked back at the shelves, at the rows of pills, at the faces of those he served. And he wondered, how many more would they condemn before they learned the truth?",
            "The church, it's changed. Softened. Not the hard-edged institution it used to be. I remember, back when I was a child, Sunday was a ritual.  Matching dress, shoes, purse – all of it pressed and prim.  Every Sunday, same parade. Private school, friends all there, faces scrubbed clean.  But now, they've got this \"teen mass\" - thirty minutes, tops. People come in stained shorts, dripping sand from the beach.  Families burst in late, like they're doing the church a favor by showing up at all. Even the morning masses, where I used to stand stiff and proper in my best clothes, now folks are in jeans and khakis. Khakis ain't bad, but it's...casual. \n\nThat's the thing, I guess. The church is more casual now.  \n\nI don't know if that's good or bad.  About those priests, those accusations...I don't think it matters if they were married or not. Some men, they're just broken.  It ain't about the vows, it's the darkness inside. Like in those old stories, the ones with the monsters lurking in the woods.  They're already there.  Marriage wouldn't change that.  \n\nMaybe it's a different kind of faith they need, one where they can find peace without the church's walls.",
            "The dust rose like a wraith. September, they called it. But the air held the chill of some perpetual November.  He remembered, though, the day the towers fell. A day the sky itself seemed to bleed. And the lies that flowed from the mouths of men in suits, the promises whispered like prayers. They spoke of Bin Laden, of weapons, of a righteous war. But the blood tasted of ash in his mouth, the kind that choked the light from the world.\n\nHe thought of Powell, his voice a hollow echo in that grand hall, laying out the evidence, the weight of the world on his shoulders. A man who, even then, knew the truth was a flickering candle in a storm.  A man forced to be a shepherd to lies.\n\nThe word \"malfeasance\" hung in the air, a brittle thing. An impeachable offense, they called it.  But what good are words when they are swallowed by the dust? When power is a hungry beast, and truth a forgotten prayer?\n\nThe younger Bush, he saw it in his eyes. A thirst, a hunger for something more than justice. A hunger for vengeance, for dominion, for oil-stained promises.  \n\nHe thought of the lake, his father’s weathered face, the creaking of the oars cutting through the silence. A different kind of war, fought in the stillness of the water, the smell of pine needles and damp earth. A war where the enemy was not a man, but a shadow, a memory.\n\nNow, the air tasted of smoke and despair. The whispers of the wind carried the echoes of gunfire, the cries of children lost in the dust.  And he wondered, with a cold certainty, if this was the legacy they would leave for the world. A legacy of ash and blood, a world where the only truth was the weight of the silence.",
            "The air hung thick, a gauze of ash clinging to the tongue. The boy spoke, voice a rasp in the stillness. \"I done.\" \n\n\"Mmhmm.\" \n\nA pause, the sound of rustling plastic, then a hesitant question. \"Just talk into it?\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"Ok, cool.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"Uh.\" The boy's voice trailed off, a sigh escaping his lips. \"Ok, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"How I feel about the War in Iraq...\"\n\nHe scratched at the stubble on his jaw, a long, weary sigh escaping him.  \"Let me see... um...\" \n\nHe swallowed, the words catching in his throat like grit. \"At this point, it feels pointless. I mean, it ain't even a real war, not officially. Just a... payback thing. Like we figured out who did it – those folks who hit us on nine-eleven.\"\n\nHe looked out, his gaze lost in the gray distance.  \"I don't follow it much, the War in Iraq.  Don't know the details.  But it feels like we're hanging on, trying to build some kind of democracy there. Make it another... American thing.\"  \n\nHe spat on the ground, a bitter taste in his mouth. \"And maybe grab some oil while we're at it. But it ain't right, all this anger, all this fighting. It ain't solving anything.\"\n\nHe looked down at his hands, calloused and worn. \"And building democracy... that takes time, a whole lot of time.  You can't just force it. And if we just walk away, well...\"  \n\nHe shook his head, the words catching in his throat again. \"They'll be mad, rightfully so. We'll have messed things up, left them to clean up the mess. It's a damned catch-22.\" \n\nHis voice dropped to a whisper. \"This whole thing... it's a damn hard one.\"",
            "The preacher's words, they hung in the air like the smoke from a dying fire.  Something ain't right.  Something ain't right about this whole damn business. It's a house of worship, a house of God, and the law got no business poking its nose in. That's what the old book says, right there. Separation of church and state. Plain as day.  They're tryin' to force their will on folks, their own brand of righteousness, and that's not the way of things. \n\nIt ain't about what some folks in Boston or up in them fancy cities think. It's about what's in the heart. What's in the soul. And that ain't for the government to decide. It's for the good Lord to judge.  This whole amendment business, it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.  They say it's about protecting the people, but it's about  control. It's about silencing dissent.\n\nThe government, they ain't got no right to tell the churches what to do.  They ain't got no right to tell us what to believe.  It's a slippery slope, this whole thing. Where does it end? What's next, they tellin' us what to eat? What to wear? Who to love?\n\nThis here's America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. And we ain't gonna stand for this kind of tyranny.",
            "The air hung thick with ash, a curtain drawn over the land. A silence hung too, heavier than the dust, broken only by the rasp of the wind through the skeletal trees. He tasted it on his tongue, the grit of the dead world.  The war, they'd called it. A righteousness wrapped in lies, a whispered promise of swift justice. But it was a slow burn, this thing they'd wrought. A festering wound on the face of the earth.\n\nHe couldn't speak its name. The word tasted like copper and bile in his mouth.  It was a dog's growl, a child's whimper, a strangled cry. It was the echo of boots on ash, the ghosts of laughter choked by smoke.\n\nThey had said it was about freedom, about bringing democracy to a land of shadows. But freedom tasted like dust, and democracy was a fragile bloom in this barren landscape.  It was a lie told over and over, a story spun to mask the hunger in the hearts of men.\n\nThey had promised a quick victory, a swift ending to the nightmare. But victory tasted like ashes, like the bitter tang of grief. And the nightmare stretched on, a tapestry woven with blood and bone.\n\nHe looked at the boy, his face creased with weariness, eyes haunted by the emptiness of the world. They were both ghosts, they were both adrift in this wasteland.  The boy, he was the only thing that kept him tethered to the remnants of humanity. The only reason to keep walking, to keep searching for a flicker of hope in the endless gray.\n\nHe thought of the lakes he used to fish in, the woods where he used to hunt, the laughter of children playing in the streets. \n\nThey were gone now, swallowed by the dust and the silence.  \n\nHe would fight for the boy, he would fight for the memory of what they had lost. He would fight until his last breath. \n\nBut even in his heart, a cold fear took root.\n\nWhat if there was nothing left to fight for?  What if the world had already been consumed by the ashes?",
            "He spoke slow, his words catching like windblown leaves in the dry brush.  \"It's somethin' personal, this. Always been. A matter of the heart, like a vein runnin' wrong.  A twist in the blood.\" He paused, thumbing a worn spot on his worn sleeve.  \"Can't legislate that, can you? Can't make a man's soul sing to another man's soul if it ain't meant to be. It's deeper than that, see?  The books, the preachers, they say it's a choice.  But I ask you, can you choose the sun to rise in the east? Can you choose the way the wind whispers through the pines?\"\n\nHe spat a wad of tobacco juice into the dust. \"It's wrong, plain wrong, to deny a man the right to love, to build a life with another.  Just because some folks can't understand it, shouldn't mean they get to take it away.\"\n\nHis voice, low and rumbling, echoed in the vast emptiness around them. \"I see it in my neighborhood.  Folks livin' their lives, just like any other. Walkin' their dogs, tendin' their gardens, shapin' their little worlds.  Why should they be less?  Why should they have to hide?\"\n\nHe shook his head, the motion slow and weary. \"It ain't about God, not really. It's about fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of what they don't understand.  It's a sickness, that fear. It eats away at the heart, leaves nothin' but bitterness in its wake.\"  \n\n\nHe sighed, the sound a gust of wind through dry bones.  \"Let 'em try to legislate love, I say. Let 'em try to box it in, to control it. It'll just keep growin',  stronger, wilder.  Love always finds a way.\"",
            "The boy spoke, voice thin as a wire in the dead air.  \"You put somethin' on the internet, it's out there. Open road. Can't take it back.\"\n\nThe words hung, heavy as ash, in the silence.  A truth the boy knew in his bones, a truth etched in the dust and bone of the ravaged world. \"It's a public square,\" he went on, \"a gossip well that never runs dry. Say somethin' loud enough, someone's gonna hear.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy's question, the one that had followed them like a shadow across the scorched plains. \"What if you talk 'bout... blowin' things up?\" he'd asked. \"What if you talk 'bout shootin'?\"\n\nA grim smile tugged at the man's lips. \"Someone's gonna take notice.  And they'll act. Gotta act. Can't just leave it hangin' like a crows nest in the wind.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, small skull tilted, eyes dark as the empty sky. \"Like the school,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Like the school,\" the man agreed.\n\nHe remembered the whisperings, the fear that had crawled through the halls like a starved dog.  The boy's words, his innocence, a flickering candle in the encroaching dark.  \"It could be a joke,\" the man had said then. \"Some kid messin' around.\"\n\nBut the words lingered, a poison seed planted in fertile ground.  Someone heard. Someone saw.  And the world shifted, tilted on its axis.\n\n\"They gotta check,\" the man said now, voice gravelly from dust and despair. \"Can't ignore it.  Can't let it fester.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, eyes filled with a weariness beyond years. \"But,\" he added, \"you gotta be careful what you plant.\"\n\nThe boy looked down, fiddling with a loose thread on his ragged shirt. \"Can't control what people think,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"No,\" the man agreed. \"But you can control your words.  They're the seeds you sow.\"\n\nThe wind howled through the skeletal trees, a mournful lament for a world gone silent.  The sun, a pale ghost in the sky, offered no warmth, no hope.\n\nOnly the ashes.",
            "The war. It stretched on like a bad dream, a wound that wouldn't close.  At first, the purpose felt right, clear. To bring democracy to a land choked by iron. But somewhere along the way, the light had dimmed. Now it felt like a hunger, a need to prove something, to show the world the weight of our power.  \n\nThe motives, even then, felt muddy. Whispers of old scores, of debts owed and favors sought, lingered like smoke. The son of a man who'd tangled with that Saddam Hussein before, a puppet master pulling strings from afar.  \n\nDemocracy, a fine ideal. But the thirst for it had gone sour, the taste of it turned bitter. It seemed we'd made our point in the first blood-soaked months. The world had seen. Heard.  But the hammering went on. Years bled into years, the years bleeding into the young men whose lives were spilled on that arid ground. \n\nWe were fighting to win, to prove something, though what that something was, nobody seemed to say any more.  It felt like a bad habit, a sickness we couldn't shake.\n\nBillions spent, for what?  While our own cities crumbled, our own people starved. Poverty gnawed at the edges of our society, education withered, and healthcare became a luxury.\n\nWe were bleeding ourselves dry for a cause that had lost its way, a phantom in the desert wind.  It was time to stop. Time to let the desert sand claim its own. Time to turn our backs on the ghosts of tyrants and bring our sons home.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of ash and dust. He spoke, voice low, almost a rasp.  \"It's a question, ain't it? About the line we walk. What's seen, what's hidden.\" He paused, fingers tracing a worn groove in the table, the plastic worn smooth by time and weather. \"They say the world's wide open, everything laid out for the taking on them there computers. But is it truly open? Or is it just another kind of cage?\" He looked up, eyes shadowed, a storm gathering behind them.  \"You put something out there, even a word, a picture, and it ain't yours anymore, is it?\" \n\nHe shook his head slowly, letting the question hang in the air. \"This boy, this boy nearly slipped through the cracks. Someone saw, someone cared. Maybe that's the world we're cursed with now, a world where every shadow's watched, every breath a whisper in the wind. We think we're free, but the truth is, we're all just players in a vast, unending game. And the rules, well, they're changing faster than the desert wind.\"\n\nHe fell silent, staring into the dying embers of the fire. \"Is it right? Is it wrong? These questions, they gnaw at you, don't they? But the answers, they're buried deep, maybe deeper than we can find them.\"",
            "The air hung thick, a silence choked by dust and ash. Words, like brittle leaves, skittered across the barren landscape of his mind.  He knew what he had to say, what the world needed to hear. But the words, they wouldn't come easy. Not clean, not sharp.  They tangled, snagged on the barbs of doubt and the ghosts of a war fought in shadows long gone.\n\n\"It's a lie,\" he rasped, the sound catching in his throat like gravel. \"A goddamn lie.\"  \n\nHe felt a kinship with the ghosts of those who had come before, those who had fought and died on battlefields stripped bare, their voices swallowed by the endless wind. \"They say it was for freedom,\" he continued, his voice a low growl, \"for democracy. But freedom's a brittle thing, a whisper lost in the canyons of a dying land.\"\n\nHe traced the lines of his palm, the map of a life etched in hardship and sorrow. \"They don't understand,\" he muttered, his gaze fixed on the unforgiving horizon. \"They sit in their ivory towers, blind to the blood spilled in the name of their ambitions.\"\n\nThe statistics, they meant nothing. The numbers, cold and clinical, couldn't capture the weight of loss, the echoes of screams swallowed by the desert night. \n\n\"Eighty percent, they say,\" he croaked, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. \"Eighty percent of the world knows it was a mistake. But what good are numbers when faced with the desolate truth?\"\n\nHe looked up, his eyes searching the endless expanse, a plea for understanding lost in the swirling dust. \"There's no victory in this land,\" he whispered, his voice ragged with despair. \"Only the bitter taste of ash and the ghosts of broken promises.\"",
            "The air hung thick with it, this thing they called equality. A lie whispered in boardrooms, a ghost in the halls of power.  Women, they said, had come a long way. But the glass ceiling remained, a shimmering, unforgiving surface.  A man looking down might mistake it for clear sky, but those who climbed knew the truth. The weight of history pressed down, the echoes of an old world where a woman's place was in the home, her ambition stifled by societal expectations. \n\nIt wasn't just women, though. The fields of work, they had their own unforgiving borders.  A man at home with his children,  a shade of blue in a world of grays, faced scorn. \"The breadwinner,\" they called him, a title that stung like a branding iron.  \n\nAnd fashion, that world of spun silk and fleeting trends, it held its own prejudices. A man who dared to tread its paths, to speak of color and cut, was met with suspicion.  His words, twisted into doubts, his intentions questioned. \"A man in fashion?\" they'd sneer, \"Does he even know what women want?\"\n\nIt was a slow rot, this prejudice, ingrained in the very marrow of society.  But change, it came in whispers, in the quiet acts of defiance. A woman stepping into a boardroom, a man choosing to nurture instead of provide.  Slowly, the lines blurred, the borders softened. It was a long road, but every step counted.  One day, maybe, the world would see the truth: that strength came in all forms, that talent knew no gender, and that beauty resided not in conformity, but in the courage to be oneself.",
            "The talk was of laws, not of God. Decriminalization, they called it. A word like ash, settling on the tongue.  Not criminal, not anymore. More like a speeding ticket, a fine, a slap on the wrist. He'd heard the talk, the arguments: the cost of hauling men in, the weight of the courts, the drain on the treasury. Money, always money. A new kind of  poverty, a hunger for it.  But something else lingered beneath the talk, a shadow in the corners of the room. The fear, the whispers about jobs, about futures, about the stain that wouldn't wash. \n\nHe'd seen the way they looked at those marks, the way they clung to the old ways. Denver, they said, a haven. A place where the air was thin and the minds were open. Maybe. But even there, the smoke from the devil's herb hung heavy. A constant reminder of the things that lurked beneath the surface, the things that couldn't be spoken aloud. They decriminalized it, they said, but it still had teeth. Still held the power to bite. \n\nHe thought of his uncle, sitting in the old rowboat, the lake a mirror to the sky.  The silence between them, thick as the humid air.  The way his uncle watched the water, his eyes like old marbles, reflecting a world long gone.   They'd been silent, those days.  But he knew his uncle thought about it, about the things that were  unspeakable. The things that lingered in the corners of memory, the things that made the heart ache.",
            "The man sat, his gaze fixed on the dust motes dancing in the thin light filtering through the cracked windowpane. He shifted in his worn chair, the wood creaking a low protest. \"Yes,\" he said finally, his voice rough as gravel. \"Tradition. It's a weight, a thing you carry, a cloak that both warms and binds.\" He paused, his eyes drifting to the faded crucifix hanging crookedly on the wall. \"They say it's good, to be rooted. But the roots, they can strangle you too. They can keep you from seeing the world changing.\" \n\nHe sighed, the sound rasping in his chest. \"They cling to it, the old ways. The church, the rituals, the dogma. It's a fortress against the darkness, they say. But sometimes,\" he added, his voice dropping to a whisper, \"the darkness comes from within.\"\n\nHe looked up, his gaze lingering on the crucifix. \"They want you perfect, these people of the cloth. They want you to fold yourself into their mold, to fit the pattern. But there are cracks in the mold, fissures where the light breaks through. Where doubt takes root. And sometimes,\" he said, his voice hardening, \"those cracks are all that keep you sane.\"\n\n\nHe remembered his father, his face weathered and worn, his eyes filled with a quiet despair. He remembered the whispers in the shadows, the unspoken judgments. \"My father,\" he said, his voice barely audible, \"he was different. He didn't fit. They shunned him, they cast him out. And for what? For loving another, for daring to choose his own path?\"\n\nHe stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. \"It's hypocrisy, that's what it is. They preach love, but they build walls of exclusion. They speak of forgiveness, but they offer only judgment.\" He shook his head, his eyes filled with a weary anger. \"The world is changing, but they cling to the past. They're blind to the truth.\"\n\nHe walked to the window, his shadow stretching long and thin across the floor. \"The only truth,\" he said, his voice hollow, \"is in the heart. In the choices you make, the paths you choose. And sometimes, the hardest choice is to break free from the chains of tradition, to walk your own way, even if it leads you into the darkness.\"",
            "The line, it blurs. Church and state, a frayed seam in the fabric of this country. Two sides, locked in a dance, one foot on the altar, the other on the courthouse steps. Marriage, they say. A sacrament, they whisper.  A contract, they decree. But what's a contract but a promise, and what's a promise but a faith, a hope, a fragile thing in the face of this hard world?\n\nIt's a question that gnaws, a bone picked clean, leaving only the marrow of doubt.  Two bodies, bound. Two souls, entangled. The government, a cold judge, should it weigh in? Define this thing they call love, this thing that bleeds and births and breaks?\n\nBaptism, they say. A sacrament. But what of the unseen bonds, the ties that hold families together, the whispers of kinship that echo through generations? Should these be measured, weighed, cataloged by the state?  \n\nCivil unions, they say. A compromise. But is a contract a cradle, a haven?  Or just a cage, gilded but still a cage?  \n\nWhat of the love that cannot be contained, that spills over the edges of definition? It's a wildfire, a storm surge, a force beyond the grasp of law.  \n\nLet the states decide, some say. But what of the unity, the fabric of this nation, frayed by discord?  \n\nA constitutional amendment, a wall built to keep out the light. A monument to fear, not faith.  The constitution, it is a beacon, a promise of liberty, not a weapon to be wielded against the tender shoots of love.\n\nAmend it for a cause? For a fear? No.  Love isn't a battle to be fought, a cause to be won. It's a song, a whisper, a quiet truth that echoes in the chambers of the heart.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and ash.  The man spoke low, his words rasping like stones in a dry creek bed. \"Raised right, I was. Church every Sunday. Taught to believe. But these things, these… choices… they're a tangled thing, ain't they? Like a knot tied in a rope that won't come undone.\" \n\nHe shifted, the weight of the world settling on his shoulders. \"Friends I got, good friends, different.  I don't rightly say I understand it, this… this way of life. But they're my brothers, my kin.  Shouldn't be a sin, should it?  If two souls find peace in each other,  what right have we to judge?\"\n\nHis gaze drifted to the road ahead, a ribbon of dust winding through the desolate landscape. \"Each state, that's where it should be decided.  Let the people speak. Let them choose their own path, their own reckoning.  A man can't force his beliefs on another, no more than he can force the sun to rise in the west.\"\n\nHe spat a wad of tobacco into the dust. \"That man in Washington, he thinks he knows best, don't he?  But he ain't God.  He's a man, just like the rest of us, prone to error, to doubt, to fear.  Let the states decide.  Let it be a matter of conscience, not of decree.\"  \n\nHe fell silent, his eyes fixed on the horizon, a distant smudge of gray against the dying light. \"Some things,\" he murmured, \"are better left unsaid.  Some truths are too heavy to bear.\"",
            "The words hung there, half-formed, swallowed by the bleak silence. \"Public?\" he rasped, the word a brittle shard against the ash-grey landscape. \"Yeah, public. Like a billboard in the wasteland.\" A cough tore through him, a ragged rasp in the stillness.\n\n\"People seein' it, that's the point, ain't it?\" His gaze drifted across the sun-bleached expanse, where skeletal trees clawed at the leaden sky. \"They see your soul laid bare, your thoughts like vultures circling.\"\n\nHe shifted, the worn fabric of his coat whispering against his lean frame. \"School officials, they got a right, you think? To peek into your heart, see what's festerin' inside? Just 'cause they got a badge and a uniform?\"\n\nA long silence stretched, punctuated only by the wind's mournful sigh through the shattered branches. \"Maybe it's about safety,\" he finally muttered, his voice a dry whisper. \"Maybe they're lookin' for the storm clouds gatherin', the ones that might burst into fire.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, eyes shadowed and deep. \"But what if they find the wrong kind of storm? What if they think a dark thought is a threat, a whisper of rebellion a call to arms?\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his voice dropping to a low growl. \"They say everything you put out there stays out there. A ghost echoin' through the canyons of the internet. But what if they start huntin' ghosts? What if they start fearin' the shadows?\"\n\nHe looked back at the desolate landscape, his face etched with a weary resignation. \"Maybe they ain't savin' lives. Maybe they're just buryin' them deeper.\"",
            "The war. Nine Eleven.  The air hung thick with it then. Made a man want to pour oil on the fire, see it burn clean.  That's how I felt.  But now... now the ash settles. The smoke clears.  And you see the bones. \n\nWe went in like a fever, eyes glazed, hearts pounding.  Thought we'd strike the matches, set the world right.  Didn't stop to think about the wind.  Didn't think about where the sparks would fly.  Didn't think about the tinder, dry and waiting.   \n\nThey say chaos is a ladder, but in that place it was a tangled mess of roots, choking the light. We tried to prune it, carve order from the chaos.  But the more we cut, the more it bled.\n\nThey say you can't judge a people by their worst, but sometimes... sometimes the worst is all you see.  They fight amongst themselves, like wolves starving for scraps.  And you wonder, do they even know what it means to be human?\n\nMaybe that's the real mistake.  Going in there with our own measure of humanity, expecting it to fit.  It doesn't.  Their world is a different kind of darkness.  We brought our light, but it only burned brighter in the shadows.\n\nNow, the light fades.  The war drags on, a slow bleed.  We're losing ground, losing hope.  Maybe it's time to walk away.  Let the ashes settle.  Let the wind carry the whispers of what was.\n\nBut even in the silence, the ghosts of nine Eleven linger.  They'll stay with us, a shadow on the horizon, a reminder of the cost of anger, of the price of forgetting."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, she needs to change.  That much is plain.  They talk of losing their flock, these men in their black robes, and the reason ain't hard to see. They hold fast to things, to ways of thinking older than the dust on these worn-out roads.  The world turns, but they stand rigid, their faces etched in stone.\n\nTake marriage, for instance. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, they say it ain't right. They cling to a scripture older than the hills, a book of stories told in firelight, a time when the world was young and different. And what of a woman's right to choose?  The body, a vessel, a thing to be controlled.  Birth control, a sin. Abortion, a stain. These are the things they preach, these are the things that drive folks away, like smoke from a dying fire.\n\nThis ain't new. I've heard the whispers, the voices murmuring in the shadows. They say the Church stands on a foundation cracked and crumbling. The old ways no longer hold sway.  The wind of change is blowing, and the Church, she stands against it, her roots dug deep in the ground, blind to the storm gathering on the horizon.\n\n\nThey say the Church is against abortion.  A woman's choice, they say, is a sin.  But what of the woman, what of her burden, her pain?  Is she not a soul, a being worthy of compassion?\n\nAnd the gays, the ones who love each other, who seek only to share their lives in the light of day. They are deemed an abomination, a stain on the fabric of God's creation.  They are cast out, ostracized, their love branded a sin.\n\nI don't see it that way.  I see two souls, bound together by a love as real and true as any other.  Why should they be denied the simple right to happiness? \n\nThey say priests should be celibate, devoted solely to God.  But what of the man who yearns for companionship, for the warmth of another soul?  Does God not wish for his children to find joy and fulfillment in this life, in love and connection? \n\nThis ain't a matter of doctrine or scripture.  It's a matter of the heart, of compassion, of understanding.  The Church needs to open her eyes, to see the world as it is, not as it was.   The world is changing, and the Church, if she wants to survive, must change with it.",
            "The boy sat across from him, eyes wide and fixed. \"Do you think,\" he said, voice small, \"that some things are just the way they are?\" \n\nThe man stared into the distance, his gaze fixed on the dull gray horizon. Dust motes danced in the sliver of light that pierced the gloom. \"Maybe,\" he said, his voice rough and low. \"Maybe some things are just the way they are.\"\n\n\"Like...\" the boy hesitated, searching for the right words. \"Like...love?\"\n\nThe man turned his head slowly, a shadow of a smile flickering across his face. \"Love,\" he echoed, the word hanging heavy in the silence. \"Love is a hard thing to pin down.\"  He gestured vaguely towards the vast emptiness that stretched before them. \"This world,\" he said, \"it's full of things that can't be explained.\"\n\nThe boy considered this for a long moment, chewing on the end of a stray thread on his worn blanket. \"So it's okay,\" he said finally, \"if people love people, even if it's not...the way they're supposed to?\"\n\nThe man looked at him then, his eyes filled with a strange tenderness. \"Maybe,\" he repeated, his voice softer now. \"Maybe it's just okay.\"",
            "The boy looked up at the man, his eyes pale and watchful in the dust-choked light. \"Should we?\" he asked, voice thin.\n\n\"Should we what?\" the man said, his gaze fixed on the road stretching out before them, a ribbon of gray against the ashen landscape.\n\n\"Should we like... marry?\"\n\nThe man shifted the weight of the knapsack on his shoulder, the worn canvas creaking. \"Marry? Why?\"\n\n\"Just like... everyone else.\"\n\n\"Everyone else,\" the man echoed, the words tasting bitter on his tongue. \"They ain't got nothin' to teach us, son. Not anymore.\" \n\nThe boy frowned. \"But it means... somethin', don't it?\" He looked around at the desolate landscape, the skeletal trees clawing at the gray sky. \"Something good.\"\n\nThe man said nothing for a long time, just stared at the road. Then he looked down at the boy, his face lined and weathered like a piece of old leather. \"This ain't a world for good things, son,\" he said. \"Not anymore. This world's for survival.\"\n\n\"But... what if it could be different?\" the boy persisted, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nThe man touched the boy's shoulder gently, his hand calloused and rough. \"We'll see,\" he said, his voice low and uncertain. \"We'll see.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence stretching between them like a shroud. The wind whispered through the ash-covered trees, carrying with it the faint scent of something dying.",
            "The air hung thick with the smell of sickness and dust. The pharmacy, a fluorescent-lit cage, hummed with a low, constant thrum. He glanced at the vials lining the shelves, the rows of pills, the brightly colored labels.  \"Just because something is outlawed,\" he said, his voice rasping, \"doesn't mean it has no use.\" He spoke slowly, picking his words carefully. \"There's a kind of shadow cast on it, a fear. A lie.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy, pale and thin, coughing in the next room. A cough that clawed at his insides, a cough that the pills couldn't touch. He thought of the whispers in the hallways, the hushed tones, the judging eyes. They called it a devil's weed, a poison, a gateway. But he knew better. He'd seen the way it could ease the pain, the way it could bring a moment of peace.\n\n\"They lock it away,\" he continued, \"but it grows wild, untamed. It's there in the alleys, in the shadows, in the minds of those who dare to seek it.\"\n\nHe saw the boy's face, the fear in his eyes, the desperation. He knew what it was to be trapped, to be sick, to be alone. He knew the hunger for relief, the yearning for a sliver of solace. And he knew that sometimes, the only solace could be found in the darkness. \n\n\"It's not a monster,\" he whispered, his voice barely audible above the hum of the fluorescent lights. \"It's a whisper, a promise. A possibility.\"\n\nHe looked back at the shelves, at the rows of pills, at the faces of those he served. And he wondered, how many more would they condemn before they learned the truth?",
            "The church, it's changed. Softened. Not the hard-edged institution it used to be. I remember, back when I was a child, Sunday was a ritual.  Matching dress, shoes, purse – all of it pressed and prim.  Every Sunday, same parade. Private school, friends all there, faces scrubbed clean.  But now, they've got this \"teen mass\" - thirty minutes, tops. People come in stained shorts, dripping sand from the beach.  Families burst in late, like they're doing the church a favor by showing up at all. Even the morning masses, where I used to stand stiff and proper in my best clothes, now folks are in jeans and khakis. Khakis ain't bad, but it's...casual. \n\nThat's the thing, I guess. The church is more casual now.  \n\nI don't know if that's good or bad.  About those priests, those accusations...I don't think it matters if they were married or not. Some men, they're just broken.  It ain't about the vows, it's the darkness inside. Like in those old stories, the ones with the monsters lurking in the woods.  They're already there.  Marriage wouldn't change that.  \n\nMaybe it's a different kind of faith they need, one where they can find peace without the church's walls.",
            "The dust rose like a wraith. September, they called it. But the air held the chill of some perpetual November.  He remembered, though, the day the towers fell. A day the sky itself seemed to bleed. And the lies that flowed from the mouths of men in suits, the promises whispered like prayers. They spoke of Bin Laden, of weapons, of a righteous war. But the blood tasted of ash in his mouth, the kind that choked the light from the world.\n\nHe thought of Powell, his voice a hollow echo in that grand hall, laying out the evidence, the weight of the world on his shoulders. A man who, even then, knew the truth was a flickering candle in a storm.  A man forced to be a shepherd to lies.\n\nThe word \"malfeasance\" hung in the air, a brittle thing. An impeachable offense, they called it.  But what good are words when they are swallowed by the dust? When power is a hungry beast, and truth a forgotten prayer?\n\nThe younger Bush, he saw it in his eyes. A thirst, a hunger for something more than justice. A hunger for vengeance, for dominion, for oil-stained promises.  \n\nHe thought of the lake, his father’s weathered face, the creaking of the oars cutting through the silence. A different kind of war, fought in the stillness of the water, the smell of pine needles and damp earth. A war where the enemy was not a man, but a shadow, a memory.\n\nNow, the air tasted of smoke and despair. The whispers of the wind carried the echoes of gunfire, the cries of children lost in the dust.  And he wondered, with a cold certainty, if this was the legacy they would leave for the world. A legacy of ash and blood, a world where the only truth was the weight of the silence.",
            "The air hung thick, a gauze of ash clinging to the tongue. The boy spoke, voice a rasp in the stillness. \"I done.\" \n\n\"Mmhmm.\" \n\nA pause, the sound of rustling plastic, then a hesitant question. \"Just talk into it?\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"Ok, cool.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"Uh.\" The boy's voice trailed off, a sigh escaping his lips. \"Ok, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"How I feel about the War in Iraq...\"\n\nHe scratched at the stubble on his jaw, a long, weary sigh escaping him.  \"Let me see... um...\" \n\nHe swallowed, the words catching in his throat like grit. \"At this point, it feels pointless. I mean, it ain't even a real war, not officially. Just a... payback thing. Like we figured out who did it – those folks who hit us on nine-eleven.\"\n\nHe looked out, his gaze lost in the gray distance.  \"I don't follow it much, the War in Iraq.  Don't know the details.  But it feels like we're hanging on, trying to build some kind of democracy there. Make it another... American thing.\"  \n\nHe spat on the ground, a bitter taste in his mouth. \"And maybe grab some oil while we're at it. But it ain't right, all this anger, all this fighting. It ain't solving anything.\"\n\nHe looked down at his hands, calloused and worn. \"And building democracy... that takes time, a whole lot of time.  You can't just force it. And if we just walk away, well...\"  \n\nHe shook his head, the words catching in his throat again. \"They'll be mad, rightfully so. We'll have messed things up, left them to clean up the mess. It's a damned catch-22.\" \n\nHis voice dropped to a whisper. \"This whole thing... it's a damn hard one.\"",
            "The preacher's words, they hung in the air like the smoke from a dying fire.  Something ain't right.  Something ain't right about this whole damn business. It's a house of worship, a house of God, and the law got no business poking its nose in. That's what the old book says, right there. Separation of church and state. Plain as day.  They're tryin' to force their will on folks, their own brand of righteousness, and that's not the way of things. \n\nIt ain't about what some folks in Boston or up in them fancy cities think. It's about what's in the heart. What's in the soul. And that ain't for the government to decide. It's for the good Lord to judge.  This whole amendment business, it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.  They say it's about protecting the people, but it's about  control. It's about silencing dissent.\n\nThe government, they ain't got no right to tell the churches what to do.  They ain't got no right to tell us what to believe.  It's a slippery slope, this whole thing. Where does it end? What's next, they tellin' us what to eat? What to wear? Who to love?\n\nThis here's America. Land of the free. Home of the brave. And we ain't gonna stand for this kind of tyranny.",
            "The air hung thick with ash, a curtain drawn over the land. A silence hung too, heavier than the dust, broken only by the rasp of the wind through the skeletal trees. He tasted it on his tongue, the grit of the dead world.  The war, they'd called it. A righteousness wrapped in lies, a whispered promise of swift justice. But it was a slow burn, this thing they'd wrought. A festering wound on the face of the earth.\n\nHe couldn't speak its name. The word tasted like copper and bile in his mouth.  It was a dog's growl, a child's whimper, a strangled cry. It was the echo of boots on ash, the ghosts of laughter choked by smoke.\n\nThey had said it was about freedom, about bringing democracy to a land of shadows. But freedom tasted like dust, and democracy was a fragile bloom in this barren landscape.  It was a lie told over and over, a story spun to mask the hunger in the hearts of men.\n\nThey had promised a quick victory, a swift ending to the nightmare. But victory tasted like ashes, like the bitter tang of grief. And the nightmare stretched on, a tapestry woven with blood and bone.\n\nHe looked at the boy, his face creased with weariness, eyes haunted by the emptiness of the world. They were both ghosts, they were both adrift in this wasteland.  The boy, he was the only thing that kept him tethered to the remnants of humanity. The only reason to keep walking, to keep searching for a flicker of hope in the endless gray.\n\nHe thought of the lakes he used to fish in, the woods where he used to hunt, the laughter of children playing in the streets. \n\nThey were gone now, swallowed by the dust and the silence.  \n\nHe would fight for the boy, he would fight for the memory of what they had lost. He would fight until his last breath. \n\nBut even in his heart, a cold fear took root.\n\nWhat if there was nothing left to fight for?  What if the world had already been consumed by the ashes?",
            "He spoke slow, his words catching like windblown leaves in the dry brush.  \"It's somethin' personal, this. Always been. A matter of the heart, like a vein runnin' wrong.  A twist in the blood.\" He paused, thumbing a worn spot on his worn sleeve.  \"Can't legislate that, can you? Can't make a man's soul sing to another man's soul if it ain't meant to be. It's deeper than that, see?  The books, the preachers, they say it's a choice.  But I ask you, can you choose the sun to rise in the east? Can you choose the way the wind whispers through the pines?\"\n\nHe spat a wad of tobacco juice into the dust. \"It's wrong, plain wrong, to deny a man the right to love, to build a life with another.  Just because some folks can't understand it, shouldn't mean they get to take it away.\"\n\nHis voice, low and rumbling, echoed in the vast emptiness around them. \"I see it in my neighborhood.  Folks livin' their lives, just like any other. Walkin' their dogs, tendin' their gardens, shapin' their little worlds.  Why should they be less?  Why should they have to hide?\"\n\nHe shook his head, the motion slow and weary. \"It ain't about God, not really. It's about fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of what they don't understand.  It's a sickness, that fear. It eats away at the heart, leaves nothin' but bitterness in its wake.\"  \n\n\nHe sighed, the sound a gust of wind through dry bones.  \"Let 'em try to legislate love, I say. Let 'em try to box it in, to control it. It'll just keep growin',  stronger, wilder.  Love always finds a way.\"",
            "The boy spoke, voice thin as a wire in the dead air.  \"You put somethin' on the internet, it's out there. Open road. Can't take it back.\"\n\nThe words hung, heavy as ash, in the silence.  A truth the boy knew in his bones, a truth etched in the dust and bone of the ravaged world. \"It's a public square,\" he went on, \"a gossip well that never runs dry. Say somethin' loud enough, someone's gonna hear.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy's question, the one that had followed them like a shadow across the scorched plains. \"What if you talk 'bout... blowin' things up?\" he'd asked. \"What if you talk 'bout shootin'?\"\n\nA grim smile tugged at the man's lips. \"Someone's gonna take notice.  And they'll act. Gotta act. Can't just leave it hangin' like a crows nest in the wind.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, small skull tilted, eyes dark as the empty sky. \"Like the school,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Like the school,\" the man agreed.\n\nHe remembered the whisperings, the fear that had crawled through the halls like a starved dog.  The boy's words, his innocence, a flickering candle in the encroaching dark.  \"It could be a joke,\" the man had said then. \"Some kid messin' around.\"\n\nBut the words lingered, a poison seed planted in fertile ground.  Someone heard. Someone saw.  And the world shifted, tilted on its axis.\n\n\"They gotta check,\" the man said now, voice gravelly from dust and despair. \"Can't ignore it.  Can't let it fester.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, eyes filled with a weariness beyond years. \"But,\" he added, \"you gotta be careful what you plant.\"\n\nThe boy looked down, fiddling with a loose thread on his ragged shirt. \"Can't control what people think,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"No,\" the man agreed. \"But you can control your words.  They're the seeds you sow.\"\n\nThe wind howled through the skeletal trees, a mournful lament for a world gone silent.  The sun, a pale ghost in the sky, offered no warmth, no hope.\n\nOnly the ashes.",
            "The war. It stretched on like a bad dream, a wound that wouldn't close.  At first, the purpose felt right, clear. To bring democracy to a land choked by iron. But somewhere along the way, the light had dimmed. Now it felt like a hunger, a need to prove something, to show the world the weight of our power.  \n\nThe motives, even then, felt muddy. Whispers of old scores, of debts owed and favors sought, lingered like smoke. The son of a man who'd tangled with that Saddam Hussein before, a puppet master pulling strings from afar.  \n\nDemocracy, a fine ideal. But the thirst for it had gone sour, the taste of it turned bitter. It seemed we'd made our point in the first blood-soaked months. The world had seen. Heard.  But the hammering went on. Years bled into years, the years bleeding into the young men whose lives were spilled on that arid ground. \n\nWe were fighting to win, to prove something, though what that something was, nobody seemed to say any more.  It felt like a bad habit, a sickness we couldn't shake.\n\nBillions spent, for what?  While our own cities crumbled, our own people starved. Poverty gnawed at the edges of our society, education withered, and healthcare became a luxury.\n\nWe were bleeding ourselves dry for a cause that had lost its way, a phantom in the desert wind.  It was time to stop. Time to let the desert sand claim its own. Time to turn our backs on the ghosts of tyrants and bring our sons home.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of ash and dust. He spoke, voice low, almost a rasp.  \"It's a question, ain't it? About the line we walk. What's seen, what's hidden.\" He paused, fingers tracing a worn groove in the table, the plastic worn smooth by time and weather. \"They say the world's wide open, everything laid out for the taking on them there computers. But is it truly open? Or is it just another kind of cage?\" He looked up, eyes shadowed, a storm gathering behind them.  \"You put something out there, even a word, a picture, and it ain't yours anymore, is it?\" \n\nHe shook his head slowly, letting the question hang in the air. \"This boy, this boy nearly slipped through the cracks. Someone saw, someone cared. Maybe that's the world we're cursed with now, a world where every shadow's watched, every breath a whisper in the wind. We think we're free, but the truth is, we're all just players in a vast, unending game. And the rules, well, they're changing faster than the desert wind.\"\n\nHe fell silent, staring into the dying embers of the fire. \"Is it right? Is it wrong? These questions, they gnaw at you, don't they? But the answers, they're buried deep, maybe deeper than we can find them.\"",
            "The air hung thick, a silence choked by dust and ash. Words, like brittle leaves, skittered across the barren landscape of his mind.  He knew what he had to say, what the world needed to hear. But the words, they wouldn't come easy. Not clean, not sharp.  They tangled, snagged on the barbs of doubt and the ghosts of a war fought in shadows long gone.\n\n\"It's a lie,\" he rasped, the sound catching in his throat like gravel. \"A goddamn lie.\"  \n\nHe felt a kinship with the ghosts of those who had come before, those who had fought and died on battlefields stripped bare, their voices swallowed by the endless wind. \"They say it was for freedom,\" he continued, his voice a low growl, \"for democracy. But freedom's a brittle thing, a whisper lost in the canyons of a dying land.\"\n\nHe traced the lines of his palm, the map of a life etched in hardship and sorrow. \"They don't understand,\" he muttered, his gaze fixed on the unforgiving horizon. \"They sit in their ivory towers, blind to the blood spilled in the name of their ambitions.\"\n\nThe statistics, they meant nothing. The numbers, cold and clinical, couldn't capture the weight of loss, the echoes of screams swallowed by the desert night. \n\n\"Eighty percent, they say,\" he croaked, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. \"Eighty percent of the world knows it was a mistake. But what good are numbers when faced with the desolate truth?\"\n\nHe looked up, his eyes searching the endless expanse, a plea for understanding lost in the swirling dust. \"There's no victory in this land,\" he whispered, his voice ragged with despair. \"Only the bitter taste of ash and the ghosts of broken promises.\"",
            "The air hung thick with it, this thing they called equality. A lie whispered in boardrooms, a ghost in the halls of power.  Women, they said, had come a long way. But the glass ceiling remained, a shimmering, unforgiving surface.  A man looking down might mistake it for clear sky, but those who climbed knew the truth. The weight of history pressed down, the echoes of an old world where a woman's place was in the home, her ambition stifled by societal expectations. \n\nIt wasn't just women, though. The fields of work, they had their own unforgiving borders.  A man at home with his children,  a shade of blue in a world of grays, faced scorn. \"The breadwinner,\" they called him, a title that stung like a branding iron.  \n\nAnd fashion, that world of spun silk and fleeting trends, it held its own prejudices. A man who dared to tread its paths, to speak of color and cut, was met with suspicion.  His words, twisted into doubts, his intentions questioned. \"A man in fashion?\" they'd sneer, \"Does he even know what women want?\"\n\nIt was a slow rot, this prejudice, ingrained in the very marrow of society.  But change, it came in whispers, in the quiet acts of defiance. A woman stepping into a boardroom, a man choosing to nurture instead of provide.  Slowly, the lines blurred, the borders softened. It was a long road, but every step counted.  One day, maybe, the world would see the truth: that strength came in all forms, that talent knew no gender, and that beauty resided not in conformity, but in the courage to be oneself.",
            "The talk was of laws, not of God. Decriminalization, they called it. A word like ash, settling on the tongue.  Not criminal, not anymore. More like a speeding ticket, a fine, a slap on the wrist. He'd heard the talk, the arguments: the cost of hauling men in, the weight of the courts, the drain on the treasury. Money, always money. A new kind of  poverty, a hunger for it.  But something else lingered beneath the talk, a shadow in the corners of the room. The fear, the whispers about jobs, about futures, about the stain that wouldn't wash. \n\nHe'd seen the way they looked at those marks, the way they clung to the old ways. Denver, they said, a haven. A place where the air was thin and the minds were open. Maybe. But even there, the smoke from the devil's herb hung heavy. A constant reminder of the things that lurked beneath the surface, the things that couldn't be spoken aloud. They decriminalized it, they said, but it still had teeth. Still held the power to bite. \n\nHe thought of his uncle, sitting in the old rowboat, the lake a mirror to the sky.  The silence between them, thick as the humid air.  The way his uncle watched the water, his eyes like old marbles, reflecting a world long gone.   They'd been silent, those days.  But he knew his uncle thought about it, about the things that were  unspeakable. The things that lingered in the corners of memory, the things that made the heart ache.",
            "The man sat, his gaze fixed on the dust motes dancing in the thin light filtering through the cracked windowpane. He shifted in his worn chair, the wood creaking a low protest. \"Yes,\" he said finally, his voice rough as gravel. \"Tradition. It's a weight, a thing you carry, a cloak that both warms and binds.\" He paused, his eyes drifting to the faded crucifix hanging crookedly on the wall. \"They say it's good, to be rooted. But the roots, they can strangle you too. They can keep you from seeing the world changing.\" \n\nHe sighed, the sound rasping in his chest. \"They cling to it, the old ways. The church, the rituals, the dogma. It's a fortress against the darkness, they say. But sometimes,\" he added, his voice dropping to a whisper, \"the darkness comes from within.\"\n\nHe looked up, his gaze lingering on the crucifix. \"They want you perfect, these people of the cloth. They want you to fold yourself into their mold, to fit the pattern. But there are cracks in the mold, fissures where the light breaks through. Where doubt takes root. And sometimes,\" he said, his voice hardening, \"those cracks are all that keep you sane.\"\n\n\nHe remembered his father, his face weathered and worn, his eyes filled with a quiet despair. He remembered the whispers in the shadows, the unspoken judgments. \"My father,\" he said, his voice barely audible, \"he was different. He didn't fit. They shunned him, they cast him out. And for what? For loving another, for daring to choose his own path?\"\n\nHe stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor. \"It's hypocrisy, that's what it is. They preach love, but they build walls of exclusion. They speak of forgiveness, but they offer only judgment.\" He shook his head, his eyes filled with a weary anger. \"The world is changing, but they cling to the past. They're blind to the truth.\"\n\nHe walked to the window, his shadow stretching long and thin across the floor. \"The only truth,\" he said, his voice hollow, \"is in the heart. In the choices you make, the paths you choose. And sometimes, the hardest choice is to break free from the chains of tradition, to walk your own way, even if it leads you into the darkness.\"",
            "The line, it blurs. Church and state, a frayed seam in the fabric of this country. Two sides, locked in a dance, one foot on the altar, the other on the courthouse steps. Marriage, they say. A sacrament, they whisper.  A contract, they decree. But what's a contract but a promise, and what's a promise but a faith, a hope, a fragile thing in the face of this hard world?\n\nIt's a question that gnaws, a bone picked clean, leaving only the marrow of doubt.  Two bodies, bound. Two souls, entangled. The government, a cold judge, should it weigh in? Define this thing they call love, this thing that bleeds and births and breaks?\n\nBaptism, they say. A sacrament. But what of the unseen bonds, the ties that hold families together, the whispers of kinship that echo through generations? Should these be measured, weighed, cataloged by the state?  \n\nCivil unions, they say. A compromise. But is a contract a cradle, a haven?  Or just a cage, gilded but still a cage?  \n\nWhat of the love that cannot be contained, that spills over the edges of definition? It's a wildfire, a storm surge, a force beyond the grasp of law.  \n\nLet the states decide, some say. But what of the unity, the fabric of this nation, frayed by discord?  \n\nA constitutional amendment, a wall built to keep out the light. A monument to fear, not faith.  The constitution, it is a beacon, a promise of liberty, not a weapon to be wielded against the tender shoots of love.\n\nAmend it for a cause? For a fear? No.  Love isn't a battle to be fought, a cause to be won. It's a song, a whisper, a quiet truth that echoes in the chambers of the heart.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and ash.  The man spoke low, his words rasping like stones in a dry creek bed. \"Raised right, I was. Church every Sunday. Taught to believe. But these things, these… choices… they're a tangled thing, ain't they? Like a knot tied in a rope that won't come undone.\" \n\nHe shifted, the weight of the world settling on his shoulders. \"Friends I got, good friends, different.  I don't rightly say I understand it, this… this way of life. But they're my brothers, my kin.  Shouldn't be a sin, should it?  If two souls find peace in each other,  what right have we to judge?\"\n\nHis gaze drifted to the road ahead, a ribbon of dust winding through the desolate landscape. \"Each state, that's where it should be decided.  Let the people speak. Let them choose their own path, their own reckoning.  A man can't force his beliefs on another, no more than he can force the sun to rise in the west.\"\n\nHe spat a wad of tobacco into the dust. \"That man in Washington, he thinks he knows best, don't he?  But he ain't God.  He's a man, just like the rest of us, prone to error, to doubt, to fear.  Let the states decide.  Let it be a matter of conscience, not of decree.\"  \n\nHe fell silent, his eyes fixed on the horizon, a distant smudge of gray against the dying light. \"Some things,\" he murmured, \"are better left unsaid.  Some truths are too heavy to bear.\"",
            "The words hung there, half-formed, swallowed by the bleak silence. \"Public?\" he rasped, the word a brittle shard against the ash-grey landscape. \"Yeah, public. Like a billboard in the wasteland.\" A cough tore through him, a ragged rasp in the stillness.\n\n\"People seein' it, that's the point, ain't it?\" His gaze drifted across the sun-bleached expanse, where skeletal trees clawed at the leaden sky. \"They see your soul laid bare, your thoughts like vultures circling.\"\n\nHe shifted, the worn fabric of his coat whispering against his lean frame. \"School officials, they got a right, you think? To peek into your heart, see what's festerin' inside? Just 'cause they got a badge and a uniform?\"\n\nA long silence stretched, punctuated only by the wind's mournful sigh through the shattered branches. \"Maybe it's about safety,\" he finally muttered, his voice a dry whisper. \"Maybe they're lookin' for the storm clouds gatherin', the ones that might burst into fire.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, eyes shadowed and deep. \"But what if they find the wrong kind of storm? What if they think a dark thought is a threat, a whisper of rebellion a call to arms?\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his voice dropping to a low growl. \"They say everything you put out there stays out there. A ghost echoin' through the canyons of the internet. But what if they start huntin' ghosts? What if they start fearin' the shadows?\"\n\nHe looked back at the desolate landscape, his face etched with a weary resignation. \"Maybe they ain't savin' lives. Maybe they're just buryin' them deeper.\"",
            "The war. Nine Eleven.  The air hung thick with it then. Made a man want to pour oil on the fire, see it burn clean.  That's how I felt.  But now... now the ash settles. The smoke clears.  And you see the bones. \n\nWe went in like a fever, eyes glazed, hearts pounding.  Thought we'd strike the matches, set the world right.  Didn't stop to think about the wind.  Didn't think about where the sparks would fly.  Didn't think about the tinder, dry and waiting.   \n\nThey say chaos is a ladder, but in that place it was a tangled mess of roots, choking the light. We tried to prune it, carve order from the chaos.  But the more we cut, the more it bled.\n\nThey say you can't judge a people by their worst, but sometimes... sometimes the worst is all you see.  They fight amongst themselves, like wolves starving for scraps.  And you wonder, do they even know what it means to be human?\n\nMaybe that's the real mistake.  Going in there with our own measure of humanity, expecting it to fit.  It doesn't.  Their world is a different kind of darkness.  We brought our light, but it only burned brighter in the shadows.\n\nNow, the light fades.  The war drags on, a slow bleed.  We're losing ground, losing hope.  Maybe it's time to walk away.  Let the ashes settle.  Let the wind carry the whispers of what was.\n\nBut even in the silence, the ghosts of nine Eleven linger.  They'll stay with us, a shadow on the horizon, a reminder of the cost of anger, of the price of forgetting."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, it needs changing. Its ways, they're as old as dust. They say the flock is thinning, and maybe that's because the shepherd ain't looking in the right direction.  You can't hold onto things like they're buried in stone. Things like marriage, like a woman's place, like the blood of the unborn - they ain't set in concrete. Times change. \n\nTake marriage, for instance. Loving two of the same kind, it don't feel wrong to me. Feels like God made us all with a need to love, to share our lives. And that ain't no sin.  Then there's the matter of birth control, of a woman's right over her own body.  The Church says it's against God's will, but who made them the judge? God gave them free will, didn't he?\n\nFolks are leaving, you see. They can't swallow the old ways anymore. They want something more, something that speaks to the world they live in. The Church needs to open its eyes, see the world for what it is, not what it was.",
            "The boy’s words hung thin in the air, sharp as broken glass. A question. A truth laid bare. He didn't know what to say.  What could he say?  That love was a river, flowing sometimes in strange and unexpected channels? That the heart, a dark lodge in the chest, beat to its own drum?  He'd seen the boy’s eyes, clear and blue as a winter sky,  searching his face for an answer.  There was no easy answer.  Just the silence, heavy and thick as ash.\n\nHe'd seen men, his own father among them, wrestled with this thing, this truth. Their words, tangled like roots in the dirt, choked on the unspoken.  There was a fear in their eyes, a fear of the unknown, a fear of what they couldn't understand.\n\nBut the boy, he was young, innocent. He didn't see the darkness, the fear, the hate that coiled in the world's gut. He just saw the truth. Pure and simple.\n\nHe looked at the boy, his small hand clutching his own. The lightness of his touch, the innocence in his face, it cut through the lies, the whispers, the fear.  It was a truth he couldn't deny.\n\nHe squeezed the boy's hand.  \"It's right,\" he said, his voice rough, \"It's right to love.\"",
            "The road stretched out ahead, a black ribbon frayed at the edges by the dust. The boy walked beside him, legs thin and pale in the sun. They were headed south, chasing the ghost of warmth. \n\n\"Will it get warmer?\" The boy's voice was small, lost in the wind that scoured the plains.\n\nThe man didn't answer. He squinted at the horizon, searching for something, anything, that might hold the promise of respite. \n\nHe thought of the man in the white suit, the one who'd said, \"Marriage is a sacred covenant between a man and a woman.\" Words meant to bind, meant to exclude. But what of the covenants forged in the crucible of shared hardship, the bond forged in the ashes of a world gone cold?\n\nHe thought of the woman in the church pew, her eyes brimming with righteous anger. \"It's unnatural,\" she'd hissed, \"an abomination against God.\" But what of the love that bloomed in the heart of a storm, the tenderness that found solace in shared fear?\n\nHe thought of the boy, his hand tucked tight in his own. He saw the question in the boy's eyes, a reflection of the question that gnawed at him too. Was their love, their bond, less valid because it didn't fit the mold? Was it less worthy of protection, of the simple dignity that came with a legal name, a shared future?\n\n\"We'll be warm,\" he finally said, his voice rough with the dust of the road. It was a promise whispered on the wind, a prayer for a dawn that might bring not just warmth, but understanding.",
            "The boy spoke. Said it was wrong. To keep something locked away just ‘cause it was forbidden. Like some kind of sin.  \n\nHe’d seen it in the pharmacy. The vials. The bottles. Rows and rows of things that could cure and solace and hurt. Things the law said were good and things it said were bad. But the line was thin.  \n\n“Just because they say ‘no’ doesn’t mean it ain’t right,” the boy said.\n\nHe thought about it. The boy was young, eyes still bright with a kind of innocence. But he knew the weight of a bottle. The power held in a single pill.\n\n“There are things that help,” he said. “Doctors use ‘em. But some are dangerous. Some are meant for people in need, not for just anyone.”\n\nThe boy frowned. “But what if the need ain’t for a doctor?”\n\nHe stopped. Didn’t know how to answer that. \n\nHe knew the boy was talking about the herb. The green smoke that curled in the night, the smell that lingered in the air. He’d seen the way it calmed the old man, the way it eased the pain in his mother’s bones. \n\nHe’d seen the way it made people forget.\n\n“It’s a slippery slope,” he said finally. “One step here, another there. Before you know it, you’re drowning in darkness.”\n\nThe boy shook his head. “Maybe the darkness is what they’re afraid of.”",
            "The church, it’s changed. Not the way you might think, not with some grand upheaval or revolution. More like the slow, patient rot of an old thing, crumbling from the inside out. When I was a girl, Sundays meant lace and silk, little shoes that pinched and purses that clutched a rosary. We’d all be there, God’s finest, in the pews, faces solemn, voices hushed. Now?  Jeans and khakis. Flip-flops in the summer. Families rushing in, hair tangled, kids whining. They call it \"teen mass,\" a quick thirty minutes to get it over with. \n\nPeople talk about the scandals, the darkness at the heart.  They say maybe things would be different if there were women priests, if the men could walk with wives by their side. But what good are rules against the devil in a man’s heart? There are married men who do bad things. It ain't tied to the collar or the vow of celibacy. It's something deeper, something dark and twisted. \n\nThey say you can’t hide something like that, that it’ll come out. Maybe. Or maybe it’ll fester, hidden away like a wound that never heals. Maybe the church, like the world, is just a place where darkness dwells, waiting for its chance.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of a broken world. He'd seen it all before, the lies, the blood, the ash settling like a shroud. September's grief, a raw wound still bleeding.  They'd been told of a monster, a phantom threat, a devil in the desert. A puppet master pulling strings, a hand reaching for the heavens.  But the monster, it turned out, wasn't a man. It was the lie itself, a serpent coiled in the heart of power, its venom seeping into the bones of the nation.\n\nHe remembered the words, the man in the uniform, his voice a rasping echo in the suffocating air. Weapons of mass destruction.  A threat to freedom. A just cause. Lies spun from the same thread as the smoke rising from the ruins of a city devoured by fire.\n\nPowell, the general, his face etched with the weariness of a man who'd seen too much, too late. He'd stood before the world, a salesman peddling a poisoned truth. Now, even he admitted the charade, the faintest whisper of regret in his voice.\n\nMalfeasance. Impeachment. Empty words against the tide of blood. A disregard for the Constitution, a casual dismantling of the very foundations of their world. The twilight of democracy, a slow, agonizing descent into darkness.\n\nHe thought of the young men, sent to fight a phantom, their dreams swallowed by the desert sand.  Their mothers, their fathers, their sisters, their wives, left to pick up the pieces of shattered lives.  \n\nThe war, a festering wound, oozing its poison into the world. A brutal, senseless conflict, fueled by greed and fear. The echo of gunfire, the distant screams, a symphony of destruction.\n\nAnd now, a fragile peace, a patchwork of alliances stitched together with threads of hope and despair. A government teetering on the brink, a nation fractured and bleeding. The old man shook his head, a silent lament for a world gone astray.",
            "The air was thick with dust, the silence broken only by the rasp of wind across the cracked earth. He spoke in a low voice, a monotone born of weary acceptance. \"It don't feel right, this whole affair. Like a fever dream, chasing shadows.\"  \n\nHe paused, his gaze distant, lost in the ash-choked horizon. \"They say it's about justice, about payback for what happened. But it's more like a hunger, a need to prove something, to stick it to them.\"\n\nHis words were tight, measured, like stones dropped into a well. \"They say it's about democracy, about bringing light to a dark place. But the light ain't taking hold, just burnin' away what little's left.\" \n\nHe ran a hand through his hair, the gesture tired, defeated. \"It's like we're tryin' to build a church on a foundation of dust. The wind just blows it all away.\"\n\nA bitterness laced his voice. \"They say it's about oil, about security. But the oil's black gold, and the security's a fleeting thing. The only thing real are the dead, the ones who don't come home.\"\n\nHe looked at the sun, a pale disc in the gray sky, and spat. \"I don't know what the answer is, what the point is anymore. It just feels like a slow, grinding death, for everyone involved.\"\n\nHe fell silent, the words hanging heavy in the dust-filled air.",
            "The road stretched on, gray and broken, coated in the ash of some long-gone fire.  He knew the boy wouldn't understand the words, wouldn't grasp the weight of them, but he'd say them anyway. \"Separation of church and state,\" he'd murmur, the words tasting like dust in his mouth. \"Writ large in the book, right there in black and white.\"\n\nThe boy, he was young, eyes still bright with the light of innocence.  He wouldn't see the darkness that clung to these things, the shadows that stretched long and silent over the land.  How could he? He saw only the world as it was, the sun beating down on the cracked earth, the wind whispering through the skeletal remains of trees.\n\nBut the man, he saw the ghosts. He saw the hands reaching from the ground, clawing at the sky. He saw the faces in the ash, etched with the pain of a world gone mad. He saw the hunger in the eyes of men, the endless hunger for power, for control.\n\nAnd he knew, deep in the bone, that this push for a new law, this attempt to bind the church and the state together, it was a seed of that hunger. It was a step closer to the abyss.\n\n\"They want to take away our freedom,\" he'd tell the boy, his voice rough with the grit of the road. \"They want to tell us what to think, what to believe. But the book, the book says different. It says we have a right to our own faith.\"\n\nHe knew the boy wouldn't understand all the words, but he'd feel the weight of them. He'd feel the fear, the desperation that gnawed at the man's soul.  And in that shared fear, in that silent communion, they would find a kind of solace. A fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, the darkness wouldn't win.",
            "The dust settled on the cracked asphalt. A silence hung over the ruins of what had once been a city, thick as the ash that choked the air. It was the kind of silence that pressed in on a man, a silence that spoke of things long gone and things never to be. He didn't know if he'd ever seen the sun in its full light again, not since the world had turned to ash.\n\nHe kept the pistol close. Always close. The boy walked beside him, his face pale beneath the grime, his eyes wide and watchful. They were moving south, toward a country that promised nothing but more dust and more silence. He didn't know if there was anything left worth finding, but he kept walking, driven by a whisper, a promise of something beyond the endless gray.\n\n\"What happened here?\" the boy asked, his voice small and thin against the wind.\n\n\"The world forgets,\" he said, his voice a rough rasp. \"It's hard to remember what it was like before.\" He looked at the boy, his eyes shadowed. \"Before the fire.\"\n\nThey moved through the skeletal remains of buildings, past twisted metal and shattered glass. The air was thick with the smell of decay and the bitter tang of dust. He stopped at a boarded-up storefront, its windows cracked and vacant.\n\n\"What was this place?\"\n\n\"A store,\" he said, his gaze drifting to a faded sign that hung precariously from the wall. \"They sold things people wanted.\"\n\nThe boy frowned. \"What kind of things?\"\n\nHe couldn't answer. He didn't remember. He could only feel the weight of the silence, the emptiness that stretched before them like a vast, unending desert.\n\nThey continued on, their footsteps echoing in the stillness. The boy walked on, his small hand clutching his father's. He didn't question anymore. He had learned to hold onto the hand that held him, to trust the silence that surrounded them.",
            "The air hung thick with it, this business of love. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, he’d seen them all.  He’d seen them in the shadows, eyes locked like hunted things. He’d seen them in the light, hands intertwined, a quiet defiance in their gaze.  Love, he thought, a word worn thin by the world.  A word that carried the weight of judgment, of fear.  But in the end, it was just a thing, a pull, a fire that burned in the belly. \n\nHe’d seen it in the faces of children, too, a innocence he couldn’t remember. A boy with his arm around another boy, a girl with her head on a girl’s shoulder.  The same look he’d seen in his own father’s eyes, years ago, on a day the world had felt different, maybe even hopeful.\n\nHe knew the world tried to cage it, this love, to teach it a place in the shadows. To say it was wrong, unnatural.  But the man knew better. He’d seen the world unravel, seen the darkness creep in.  He’d seen the laws laid down, the lines drawn. But love, that fire, it wouldn’t be tamed. It burned on, a defiant spark in the growing gloom.\n\nHe’d seen it in the eyes of those who clung to the old ways, the fear, the anger.  A fear of what they didn't understand, a hatred born of ignorance.  But the man saw the truth: love was the only thing strong enough to fight the darkness.  It was the only thing worth fighting for.",
            "The words hang in the air, frail and echoing. A public forum, he says.  The net, a sprawling web, casting its shadow over every act, every thought.  You put it out there, and it sticks. A stain on the soul of the world.  He speaks of shootings, of violence, the kind that stains the air thick and heavy.  Someone will hear, someone will see.  The school, forced to act, to protect, to police the dreams of the young.  A whisper, a rumour, a joke skewed in the harsh light of day.  An experiment gone wrong, a sociology lesson turned chilling.  He remembers, remembers the boy, the boy's laughter in the face of a storm. On Facebook, on Myspace, words bleed into the void.  There is no privacy, no sanctuary.  The past, the future, all flattened by the cold eye of the screen.  The school, a fortress under siege, forced to sift through the digital detritus, searching for the spark, the flicker of danger.  He speaks of invasion, of boundaries breached, of the teacher’s gaze, predatory and unwelcome, lurking in the shadows of the internet.  But the words fall flat, hollow.  For in the digital world, there is no sanctuary, no hidden corner where secrets can lie undisturbed.   The internet, a judge, jury, and executioner, passes its sentence on everyone.",
            "The war, it stretches on. A wound that festers. The purpose, once clear, now a dim memory. A ghost of something good, something righteous. But the years have bled it dry. Left us chasing shadows. Proving something, to whom? To ourselves? A hollow victory, a pyrrhic cost.\n\nHe remembers the talk at the start. Democracy, a righteous cause. A hand outstretched to lift a people from tyranny. But somewhere along the line, the whispers turned to shouts. The motives, once veiled in patriotism, now nakedly exposed. The past, a tangled skein of oil fields and family feuds, cast a long, dark shadow over the present.\n\nThis land, this ravaged land, it bears the weight of it all.  The ghosts of fallen soldiers, the hollow eyes of refugees. The stench of dust and death hangs heavy in the air.\n\nIs this what they fought for? This endless, grinding conflict? Once, there was a purpose. Now, there's only the echo of it, a fading drumbeat in the desert wind.\n\nHe sees the faces of the dead, the broken bodies, the shattered dreams. He feels the weight of the world on his shoulders, the burden of a war that never ends.\n\nHe thinks of his own children, their laughter a distant memory. Their futures stolen by a conflict that has consumed everything. He wonders if they will ever know peace.\n\nHe wonders if he will.",
            "The question hung in the air, a moth caught in the dust motes of the room. \n\n\"Uh,\" she began, voice thin as a whisper. \"It was stopped, see, 'cause someone found it online.\"\n\nHe leaned back, the worn wood of the chair groaning beneath him. \"Mmm.\"\n\n\"Online? But Myspace...\" she hesitated, the words catching on her tongue. \"It's, well, it's supposed to be private, isn't it? You have to be friends.\"\n\n\"Friends,\" he echoed, the sound a hollow drumbeat in the silence. \"But isn't that what gives them permission? To see?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" she mumbled, picking at a loose thread on her sleeve. \"It's like, if you put it out there...\"\n\n\"You give it over,\" he finished, his voice a low rumble.\n\nA silence fell, thick and heavy as the dust that coated everything.\n\n\"But what if it was good,\" she finally said, her voice barely audible. \"What if someone saw it, and it meant saving a life?\"\n\n\"Tough,\" he said, the word a stone dropped in the stillness. \"You can't have some soul policing every profile, watching for trouble.\"\n\n\"But...\" she started, then stopped, her face pale and drawn. \"It's like, what if they were just looking, accidentally?\"\n\n\"Accidentally,\" he repeated, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. \"Or looking for something, a sign... \"\n\nHe trailed off, his eyes distant, seeing something beyond the chipped paint on the walls, something dark and terrible.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he said finally, his voice a rasp, \"what you put out there... it finds its way back.\"",
            "The boy sat with a crumpled pack of cigarettes in his hand, staring at the dust motes dancing in the light filtering through the cracked windowpane. \"It's all gone to shit, ain't it?\" he rasped, the words rattling in his chest like loose gravel.\n\n\"You think?\" The man, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by sun and worry, didn't look up from the worn photograph he clutched in his calloused hand. A faded image of a woman with eyes the color of a storm-tossed sea and a smile that promised a warmth long gone.\n\n\"Yeah. I mean, what was it all for?\" The boy stubbed out the cigarette on the floor, the glowing ember a fleeting defiance in the gloom. \"They said it'd be different. Said we'd bring freedom, democracy, all that shit. But it's just... ash.\"\n\nThe man nodded, the photograph clutched tight. \"They always say that. But the only thing they bring is dust and bone.\"\n\nSilence settled in the room, heavy and thick like the smoke that hung in the air. Outside, the wind howled like a wounded animal, whipping the dust into frenzied dances. \n\n\"I hate it,\" the boy whispered, his voice barely audible above the wind. \"I hate this place, this world. I hate that I might die here, with nothing but ash for company.\"\n\nThe man placed the photograph down on a dusty table, his eyes distant, lost in a memory that burned brighter than the dying embers of the world. \"There's always somewhere else,\" he said, his voice a brittle whisper. \"Somewhere beyond the dust, beyond the ash. There's always hope.\"\n\nThe boy looked at him, his eyes filled with a weariness that belied his years. \"Hope?\" he scoffed. \"Hope's a luxury we can't afford.\" \n\nThe man reached out, his hand rough and calloused, and placed it on the boy's shoulder. \"No,\" he said, his voice firm despite the tremors that shook his body. \"Hope is the only thing we have left.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of it all.  The wind, it rasped and sighed through the skeletal trees, carrying the grit of broken things.  Yeah, he felt it. The discrimination.  Cut deep, like a bone-knife. Not just for the women, though they bore the brunt.  A sickness in the marrow, the way the world saw things.\n\nHe thought of the women, trapped behind the glass roof, invisible to the men above.  Qualified, but never chosen.  Their dreams choked by the dust of history.  And the men, hemmed in too, by expectations like iron bars.  The stay-at-home dads, their hands calloused not from labor but from yearning,  looked upon with suspicion, their souls branded as lesser.\n\nThen there was the fashion, a world of brittle beauty where men who dared to dream in silks and satins were met with scorn.  \"Don't tell me about fashion, son,\" they'd sneer, \"you don't know the first thing about a woman's heart.\"  They were blind, these men, to the subtle whispers of style, the language of cloth and thread.\n\nIt was a slow burn, this injustice.  A fire smoldering under the ashes of a world that refused to see.  Change, it was a hard thing to come by.  But maybe, just maybe, a seed of understanding could take root in the barren soil.  Maybe a whisper of empathy could pierce the thick fog of prejudice.  Maybe, someday, the world would see the men and women beyond the labels, beyond the expectations, and recognize the truth:  that every soul, regardless of gender, yearned for the same things - love, acceptance, and the freedom to be themselves.",
            "The air hung thick with the smoke of things unsaid, of arguments half-remembered. Legalized, they called it. Decriminalized.  A word like cheap tobacco, meant to soothe the rough edges. He knew what it meant though. A ticket, maybe a fine. A blot on the record, a shadow that clung to you like dust. But the boy wouldn't understand. He was young, still wet behind the ears, trusting in the world's promises.\n\nHe thought about the cost, the hollow echoes of it all. The money spent to lock men up, to drag them through the system, to feed them to the maw of the state. And for what? A joint? A puff of smoke? It was a fool's errand, a waste of breath.\n\nDenver, they said. A place with open hearts and open minds. Where the air itself reeked of change, of a willingness to turn the page. But even there,  the taste of it was bitter. Like a promise whispered in the dark, doubted from the start.\n\nHe thought of the lake, the stillness of it, the way the sun bled into the water.  His uncle, weathered and silent, pulling a tree stump from the depths. A day spent in the quiet, the only sound the scrape of oars against wood. A memory, fading like the smell of woodsmoke on the wind.\n\nMarijuana. It wasn't just about the weed itself. It was about control.  About power. About the lines drawn in the sand, the boundaries that separated the haves from the have-nots.\n\nHe looked at the boy, who was still young enough to believe in fairytales. A flicker of something in his eyes, a question he didn't dare voice. He knew those questions would come. The boy would learn, in time, the harsh truths of the world. But for now, he would hold onto the illusions, the fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, things could be better.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  A shadow fell across the cracked pavement. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice a rasp. \"Because tradition binds, it holds a man to the earth. Like some ancient root. But the wind changes, and the river bends. To be rooted is to be still, to be vulnerable.\" He paused, his gaze fixed on a distant point beyond the skeletal remains of buildings. \"The weight of it, though. The expectation. It can smother a man. A man has to breathe.\"\n\nHe remembered the cold stone of the church pews, the scent of incense, the weight of the priest's gaze. \"They speak of love, of acceptance. But the church itself is a cage. Small and narrow, with bars of scripture and dogma. They judge those who fall outside the lines, who dare to question.\"  His hand clenched, knuckles white. \"My father, he was different. He sought light in the wrong places. They wouldn't bridge the gap, wouldn't accept his kind. No love there, just judgment.\"\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his eyes reflecting the dust-choked sky. \"They say you must be perfect, but perfection is a lie. A brittle thing, easily shattered. And what of those who stumble? Those who yearn for something more? They are cast out, left to wander in the wilderness of their own doubts.\"\n\nThe boy shifted, his silence a heavy weight. \"They say love is the answer,\" the man continued, his voice a low murmur. \"But love cannot exist without acceptance. Without understanding.  Without the courage to look beyond the surface, beyond the rigid rules, and see the human heart.\"",
            "The line blurred. Where did one stop and the other begin? Church and state. Right and wrong.  Two souls bound, two souls adrift.  It was a knot that twisted tighter with every word spoken, every heart felt. This wasn't some tidy debate. This was the marrow of the matter.  \n\nWas it a sacrament or a contract?  A whispered prayer in a dim church or a line scratched on a government form?  Didn't matter. Didn't it come down to two souls seeking shelter, a haven in the storm? \n\nShould the hand of the state reach into the sanctity of vows?  Or was it a matter of flesh and blood, a union recognized by the very act of joining? \n\nBaptism didn't bring tax breaks, not a single one. It didn't grant a special place at the table.  So why then, was marriage different?  Why this insistence on defining love by the weight of a law?\n\nTwo souls. Two hearts.  A shared breath. Wasn't that enough?  Didn't the government have its own burdens to bear, its own line in the sand to draw?\n\nCivil unions.  That felt closer, more honest.  No pretense, no grand pronouncements. Just two souls saying, \"Here we are.  Here we stand.\"\n\nAnd what of the states?  They clamored for their own truths, their own versions of right and wrong.  But if they could find common ground, wouldn't that be a victory?  \n\nA federal law, a beacon of shared understanding.  But an amendment?  Oh, no.  The Constitution. Sacred. Untouchable.  To sacrifice its sanctity for this?  To enshrine division in its hallowed halls?\n\nIt wasn't right. It wasn't just. It was a wound dug deep into the fabric of the nation.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of old beliefs, the scent of sulfur and regret.  Homosexuality, it was a thing whispered in the shadows, a question mark etched on the face of the land.  Raised under a roof of hymns and scripture, the notion was a tangled knot in his gut, a discord in the melody of his upbringing. He had friends, yes, souls bound by laughter and shared secrets, their laughter echoing in the hollows of his memories. Friends who walked a path he couldn't quite comprehend, a path paved with whispers and stolen glances.\n\nHe didn't understand it, not truly. But he saw the pain in their eyes, the ache for acceptance, the yearning for a love that mirrored his own. And in that, he saw a reflection of the human need, a longing for connection that transcended the boundaries of the flesh.  \n\nThe law, he felt, should be a shield, not a sword. To impose his vision, his rigid notions, on others, that felt wrong.  States, these microcosms of America, should be the arbiters of their own fate, allowed to shape their own destinies.  After all, wasn't it the right of each soul to choose its own path, to seek its own truth, even if it lay beyond the boundaries of his understanding?\n\nHe thought of the old man, his uncle, weathered and set in his ways, his pipe perpetually clenched between his teeth. A man who believed in the sanctity of tradition, in the unyielding grip of the past. But even the old man, with his stoic silence and unblinking eyes, had a flicker of humanity in his gaze, a recognition of the inherent worth of every human being.\n\nHe wished he could offer more, a clearer answer, a solution that would mend the fractured heart of the nation. But all he had were these fragments of thought, these whispered echoes in the vast emptiness of uncertainty.  \n\nFor the answers, he knew, lay not in the pronouncements of men, but in the quiet spaces between the lines, in the shared humanity that bound them all together, despite their differences.",
            "The boy shuffled closer, his breath a thin mist in the cold.  \"They're watching us,\" he said, eyes narrowed.  His voice was a rasp, like dry leaves skittering on pavement.\n\n\"They're always watching,\" the man said, his gaze fixed on the bleached horizon. The world was a canvas of ash, the sky a pale, bruised thing.  \"But they can't see everything.\"\n\nThe boy's face, gaunt and pale, was etched with worry. \"What if they find us?\"\n\nThe man tightened his grip on the rusted pistol tucked into his belt. \"Then we'll walk on.\"\n\nThey had been moving south for weeks, their path a jagged scar across the barren landscape.  The boy didn't ask questions anymore. He just walked, his small hand clutching the man's, his gaze fixed on the road ahead.  They lived in the silence of the road, the whisper of the wind through the skeletal trees, the rasp of their own breaths.\n\nHe remembered a time before. A time of warmth and light, of laughter and the smell of rain on dry earth.  But that time was gone, swallowed by the ash and the silence. Now, the world was a wasteland, a testament to some forgotten apocalypse.\n\nThey had found the city by chance, a skeletal monument to a vanished world. Buildings rose like broken teeth against the gray sky, windows empty sockets staring out at the desolation.  There was nothing left inside, only dust and the ghosts of memories.\n\nHe had stopped the boy from going inside. \"Remember what I told you,\" he had said, his voice a low growl. \"Don't touch anything. Don't look too closely.\"\n\nThe boy had nodded, eyes wide and wary.\n\nThey had found shelter in a ruined church, its stained-glass windows shattered, its walls scarred with graffiti.  The air was thick with the smell of decay, but it was a dry, brittle decay, like the husk of something long dead.\n\nThe boy slept restlessly, his nightmares echoing in the silence. The man sat beside him, hand resting on the boy's shoulder, a silent promise.  He would protect him.  He would keep him safe.\n\nHe would keep the darkness at bay.",
            "The dust of it all. War. The way it clung to him, a memory the color of ash. At first, the fires of September had burned bright in his gut, a need for retribution. To strike back against that darkness, to repay in kind. Like a fevered dream, the thought of it had seemed clear, righteous. To go over and make them pay. \n\nBut now, the embers had cooled. The heat had turned to a hollow ache. He saw the flaws in the plan, the cracks in the foundation. They’d gone in blind, driven by rage, unprepared for the tangled roots of the place. A tangled mess of history and hate, a land where men fought not for ideals but for scraps, for survival.\n\nHe thought about the faces, the eyes that stared back from the dust-choked streets. How could they understand? How could they be understood? They were caught in a cycle, a endless loop of violence. Us against them, them against us. He couldn’t reach them, couldn’t offer them anything but more of the same.\n\nIt wasn't their fault, he realized. Not entirely. But it wasn't his fault either. He'd been a pawn, a cog in a machine that had ground them all down. And now, the machine kept turning, fueled by anger and fear. \n\nHe looked out at the horizon, a vast emptiness under the sun-bleached sky. What was the point? What had they achieved? He didn't know. He only knew that the war had taken something from him, something he couldn't get back. He saw a flicker of ash in the wind, a ghost of the fires that had consumed so much.\n\nHe turned away, the weight of it all pressing down on his chest.  It was time to walk away. Leave the dust and the ashes behind. \n\nHe had to. For himself."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, it needs changing. Its ways, they're as old as dust. They say the flock is thinning, and maybe that's because the shepherd ain't looking in the right direction.  You can't hold onto things like they're buried in stone. Things like marriage, like a woman's place, like the blood of the unborn - they ain't set in concrete. Times change. \n\nTake marriage, for instance. Loving two of the same kind, it don't feel wrong to me. Feels like God made us all with a need to love, to share our lives. And that ain't no sin.  Then there's the matter of birth control, of a woman's right over her own body.  The Church says it's against God's will, but who made them the judge? God gave them free will, didn't he?\n\nFolks are leaving, you see. They can't swallow the old ways anymore. They want something more, something that speaks to the world they live in. The Church needs to open its eyes, see the world for what it is, not what it was.",
            "The boy’s words hung thin in the air, sharp as broken glass. A question. A truth laid bare. He didn't know what to say.  What could he say?  That love was a river, flowing sometimes in strange and unexpected channels? That the heart, a dark lodge in the chest, beat to its own drum?  He'd seen the boy’s eyes, clear and blue as a winter sky,  searching his face for an answer.  There was no easy answer.  Just the silence, heavy and thick as ash.\n\nHe'd seen men, his own father among them, wrestled with this thing, this truth. Their words, tangled like roots in the dirt, choked on the unspoken.  There was a fear in their eyes, a fear of the unknown, a fear of what they couldn't understand.\n\nBut the boy, he was young, innocent. He didn't see the darkness, the fear, the hate that coiled in the world's gut. He just saw the truth. Pure and simple.\n\nHe looked at the boy, his small hand clutching his own. The lightness of his touch, the innocence in his face, it cut through the lies, the whispers, the fear.  It was a truth he couldn't deny.\n\nHe squeezed the boy's hand.  \"It's right,\" he said, his voice rough, \"It's right to love.\"",
            "The road stretched out ahead, a black ribbon frayed at the edges by the dust. The boy walked beside him, legs thin and pale in the sun. They were headed south, chasing the ghost of warmth. \n\n\"Will it get warmer?\" The boy's voice was small, lost in the wind that scoured the plains.\n\nThe man didn't answer. He squinted at the horizon, searching for something, anything, that might hold the promise of respite. \n\nHe thought of the man in the white suit, the one who'd said, \"Marriage is a sacred covenant between a man and a woman.\" Words meant to bind, meant to exclude. But what of the covenants forged in the crucible of shared hardship, the bond forged in the ashes of a world gone cold?\n\nHe thought of the woman in the church pew, her eyes brimming with righteous anger. \"It's unnatural,\" she'd hissed, \"an abomination against God.\" But what of the love that bloomed in the heart of a storm, the tenderness that found solace in shared fear?\n\nHe thought of the boy, his hand tucked tight in his own. He saw the question in the boy's eyes, a reflection of the question that gnawed at him too. Was their love, their bond, less valid because it didn't fit the mold? Was it less worthy of protection, of the simple dignity that came with a legal name, a shared future?\n\n\"We'll be warm,\" he finally said, his voice rough with the dust of the road. It was a promise whispered on the wind, a prayer for a dawn that might bring not just warmth, but understanding.",
            "The boy spoke. Said it was wrong. To keep something locked away just ‘cause it was forbidden. Like some kind of sin.  \n\nHe’d seen it in the pharmacy. The vials. The bottles. Rows and rows of things that could cure and solace and hurt. Things the law said were good and things it said were bad. But the line was thin.  \n\n“Just because they say ‘no’ doesn’t mean it ain’t right,” the boy said.\n\nHe thought about it. The boy was young, eyes still bright with a kind of innocence. But he knew the weight of a bottle. The power held in a single pill.\n\n“There are things that help,” he said. “Doctors use ‘em. But some are dangerous. Some are meant for people in need, not for just anyone.”\n\nThe boy frowned. “But what if the need ain’t for a doctor?”\n\nHe stopped. Didn’t know how to answer that. \n\nHe knew the boy was talking about the herb. The green smoke that curled in the night, the smell that lingered in the air. He’d seen the way it calmed the old man, the way it eased the pain in his mother’s bones. \n\nHe’d seen the way it made people forget.\n\n“It’s a slippery slope,” he said finally. “One step here, another there. Before you know it, you’re drowning in darkness.”\n\nThe boy shook his head. “Maybe the darkness is what they’re afraid of.”",
            "The church, it’s changed. Not the way you might think, not with some grand upheaval or revolution. More like the slow, patient rot of an old thing, crumbling from the inside out. When I was a girl, Sundays meant lace and silk, little shoes that pinched and purses that clutched a rosary. We’d all be there, God’s finest, in the pews, faces solemn, voices hushed. Now?  Jeans and khakis. Flip-flops in the summer. Families rushing in, hair tangled, kids whining. They call it \"teen mass,\" a quick thirty minutes to get it over with. \n\nPeople talk about the scandals, the darkness at the heart.  They say maybe things would be different if there were women priests, if the men could walk with wives by their side. But what good are rules against the devil in a man’s heart? There are married men who do bad things. It ain't tied to the collar or the vow of celibacy. It's something deeper, something dark and twisted. \n\nThey say you can’t hide something like that, that it’ll come out. Maybe. Or maybe it’ll fester, hidden away like a wound that never heals. Maybe the church, like the world, is just a place where darkness dwells, waiting for its chance.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of a broken world. He'd seen it all before, the lies, the blood, the ash settling like a shroud. September's grief, a raw wound still bleeding.  They'd been told of a monster, a phantom threat, a devil in the desert. A puppet master pulling strings, a hand reaching for the heavens.  But the monster, it turned out, wasn't a man. It was the lie itself, a serpent coiled in the heart of power, its venom seeping into the bones of the nation.\n\nHe remembered the words, the man in the uniform, his voice a rasping echo in the suffocating air. Weapons of mass destruction.  A threat to freedom. A just cause. Lies spun from the same thread as the smoke rising from the ruins of a city devoured by fire.\n\nPowell, the general, his face etched with the weariness of a man who'd seen too much, too late. He'd stood before the world, a salesman peddling a poisoned truth. Now, even he admitted the charade, the faintest whisper of regret in his voice.\n\nMalfeasance. Impeachment. Empty words against the tide of blood. A disregard for the Constitution, a casual dismantling of the very foundations of their world. The twilight of democracy, a slow, agonizing descent into darkness.\n\nHe thought of the young men, sent to fight a phantom, their dreams swallowed by the desert sand.  Their mothers, their fathers, their sisters, their wives, left to pick up the pieces of shattered lives.  \n\nThe war, a festering wound, oozing its poison into the world. A brutal, senseless conflict, fueled by greed and fear. The echo of gunfire, the distant screams, a symphony of destruction.\n\nAnd now, a fragile peace, a patchwork of alliances stitched together with threads of hope and despair. A government teetering on the brink, a nation fractured and bleeding. The old man shook his head, a silent lament for a world gone astray.",
            "The air was thick with dust, the silence broken only by the rasp of wind across the cracked earth. He spoke in a low voice, a monotone born of weary acceptance. \"It don't feel right, this whole affair. Like a fever dream, chasing shadows.\"  \n\nHe paused, his gaze distant, lost in the ash-choked horizon. \"They say it's about justice, about payback for what happened. But it's more like a hunger, a need to prove something, to stick it to them.\"\n\nHis words were tight, measured, like stones dropped into a well. \"They say it's about democracy, about bringing light to a dark place. But the light ain't taking hold, just burnin' away what little's left.\" \n\nHe ran a hand through his hair, the gesture tired, defeated. \"It's like we're tryin' to build a church on a foundation of dust. The wind just blows it all away.\"\n\nA bitterness laced his voice. \"They say it's about oil, about security. But the oil's black gold, and the security's a fleeting thing. The only thing real are the dead, the ones who don't come home.\"\n\nHe looked at the sun, a pale disc in the gray sky, and spat. \"I don't know what the answer is, what the point is anymore. It just feels like a slow, grinding death, for everyone involved.\"\n\nHe fell silent, the words hanging heavy in the dust-filled air.",
            "The road stretched on, gray and broken, coated in the ash of some long-gone fire.  He knew the boy wouldn't understand the words, wouldn't grasp the weight of them, but he'd say them anyway. \"Separation of church and state,\" he'd murmur, the words tasting like dust in his mouth. \"Writ large in the book, right there in black and white.\"\n\nThe boy, he was young, eyes still bright with the light of innocence.  He wouldn't see the darkness that clung to these things, the shadows that stretched long and silent over the land.  How could he? He saw only the world as it was, the sun beating down on the cracked earth, the wind whispering through the skeletal remains of trees.\n\nBut the man, he saw the ghosts. He saw the hands reaching from the ground, clawing at the sky. He saw the faces in the ash, etched with the pain of a world gone mad. He saw the hunger in the eyes of men, the endless hunger for power, for control.\n\nAnd he knew, deep in the bone, that this push for a new law, this attempt to bind the church and the state together, it was a seed of that hunger. It was a step closer to the abyss.\n\n\"They want to take away our freedom,\" he'd tell the boy, his voice rough with the grit of the road. \"They want to tell us what to think, what to believe. But the book, the book says different. It says we have a right to our own faith.\"\n\nHe knew the boy wouldn't understand all the words, but he'd feel the weight of them. He'd feel the fear, the desperation that gnawed at the man's soul.  And in that shared fear, in that silent communion, they would find a kind of solace. A fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, the darkness wouldn't win.",
            "The dust settled on the cracked asphalt. A silence hung over the ruins of what had once been a city, thick as the ash that choked the air. It was the kind of silence that pressed in on a man, a silence that spoke of things long gone and things never to be. He didn't know if he'd ever seen the sun in its full light again, not since the world had turned to ash.\n\nHe kept the pistol close. Always close. The boy walked beside him, his face pale beneath the grime, his eyes wide and watchful. They were moving south, toward a country that promised nothing but more dust and more silence. He didn't know if there was anything left worth finding, but he kept walking, driven by a whisper, a promise of something beyond the endless gray.\n\n\"What happened here?\" the boy asked, his voice small and thin against the wind.\n\n\"The world forgets,\" he said, his voice a rough rasp. \"It's hard to remember what it was like before.\" He looked at the boy, his eyes shadowed. \"Before the fire.\"\n\nThey moved through the skeletal remains of buildings, past twisted metal and shattered glass. The air was thick with the smell of decay and the bitter tang of dust. He stopped at a boarded-up storefront, its windows cracked and vacant.\n\n\"What was this place?\"\n\n\"A store,\" he said, his gaze drifting to a faded sign that hung precariously from the wall. \"They sold things people wanted.\"\n\nThe boy frowned. \"What kind of things?\"\n\nHe couldn't answer. He didn't remember. He could only feel the weight of the silence, the emptiness that stretched before them like a vast, unending desert.\n\nThey continued on, their footsteps echoing in the stillness. The boy walked on, his small hand clutching his father's. He didn't question anymore. He had learned to hold onto the hand that held him, to trust the silence that surrounded them.",
            "The air hung thick with it, this business of love. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, he’d seen them all.  He’d seen them in the shadows, eyes locked like hunted things. He’d seen them in the light, hands intertwined, a quiet defiance in their gaze.  Love, he thought, a word worn thin by the world.  A word that carried the weight of judgment, of fear.  But in the end, it was just a thing, a pull, a fire that burned in the belly. \n\nHe’d seen it in the faces of children, too, a innocence he couldn’t remember. A boy with his arm around another boy, a girl with her head on a girl’s shoulder.  The same look he’d seen in his own father’s eyes, years ago, on a day the world had felt different, maybe even hopeful.\n\nHe knew the world tried to cage it, this love, to teach it a place in the shadows. To say it was wrong, unnatural.  But the man knew better. He’d seen the world unravel, seen the darkness creep in.  He’d seen the laws laid down, the lines drawn. But love, that fire, it wouldn’t be tamed. It burned on, a defiant spark in the growing gloom.\n\nHe’d seen it in the eyes of those who clung to the old ways, the fear, the anger.  A fear of what they didn't understand, a hatred born of ignorance.  But the man saw the truth: love was the only thing strong enough to fight the darkness.  It was the only thing worth fighting for.",
            "The words hang in the air, frail and echoing. A public forum, he says.  The net, a sprawling web, casting its shadow over every act, every thought.  You put it out there, and it sticks. A stain on the soul of the world.  He speaks of shootings, of violence, the kind that stains the air thick and heavy.  Someone will hear, someone will see.  The school, forced to act, to protect, to police the dreams of the young.  A whisper, a rumour, a joke skewed in the harsh light of day.  An experiment gone wrong, a sociology lesson turned chilling.  He remembers, remembers the boy, the boy's laughter in the face of a storm. On Facebook, on Myspace, words bleed into the void.  There is no privacy, no sanctuary.  The past, the future, all flattened by the cold eye of the screen.  The school, a fortress under siege, forced to sift through the digital detritus, searching for the spark, the flicker of danger.  He speaks of invasion, of boundaries breached, of the teacher’s gaze, predatory and unwelcome, lurking in the shadows of the internet.  But the words fall flat, hollow.  For in the digital world, there is no sanctuary, no hidden corner where secrets can lie undisturbed.   The internet, a judge, jury, and executioner, passes its sentence on everyone.",
            "The war, it stretches on. A wound that festers. The purpose, once clear, now a dim memory. A ghost of something good, something righteous. But the years have bled it dry. Left us chasing shadows. Proving something, to whom? To ourselves? A hollow victory, a pyrrhic cost.\n\nHe remembers the talk at the start. Democracy, a righteous cause. A hand outstretched to lift a people from tyranny. But somewhere along the line, the whispers turned to shouts. The motives, once veiled in patriotism, now nakedly exposed. The past, a tangled skein of oil fields and family feuds, cast a long, dark shadow over the present.\n\nThis land, this ravaged land, it bears the weight of it all.  The ghosts of fallen soldiers, the hollow eyes of refugees. The stench of dust and death hangs heavy in the air.\n\nIs this what they fought for? This endless, grinding conflict? Once, there was a purpose. Now, there's only the echo of it, a fading drumbeat in the desert wind.\n\nHe sees the faces of the dead, the broken bodies, the shattered dreams. He feels the weight of the world on his shoulders, the burden of a war that never ends.\n\nHe thinks of his own children, their laughter a distant memory. Their futures stolen by a conflict that has consumed everything. He wonders if they will ever know peace.\n\nHe wonders if he will.",
            "The question hung in the air, a moth caught in the dust motes of the room. \n\n\"Uh,\" she began, voice thin as a whisper. \"It was stopped, see, 'cause someone found it online.\"\n\nHe leaned back, the worn wood of the chair groaning beneath him. \"Mmm.\"\n\n\"Online? But Myspace...\" she hesitated, the words catching on her tongue. \"It's, well, it's supposed to be private, isn't it? You have to be friends.\"\n\n\"Friends,\" he echoed, the sound a hollow drumbeat in the silence. \"But isn't that what gives them permission? To see?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" she mumbled, picking at a loose thread on her sleeve. \"It's like, if you put it out there...\"\n\n\"You give it over,\" he finished, his voice a low rumble.\n\nA silence fell, thick and heavy as the dust that coated everything.\n\n\"But what if it was good,\" she finally said, her voice barely audible. \"What if someone saw it, and it meant saving a life?\"\n\n\"Tough,\" he said, the word a stone dropped in the stillness. \"You can't have some soul policing every profile, watching for trouble.\"\n\n\"But...\" she started, then stopped, her face pale and drawn. \"It's like, what if they were just looking, accidentally?\"\n\n\"Accidentally,\" he repeated, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. \"Or looking for something, a sign... \"\n\nHe trailed off, his eyes distant, seeing something beyond the chipped paint on the walls, something dark and terrible.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he said finally, his voice a rasp, \"what you put out there... it finds its way back.\"",
            "The boy sat with a crumpled pack of cigarettes in his hand, staring at the dust motes dancing in the light filtering through the cracked windowpane. \"It's all gone to shit, ain't it?\" he rasped, the words rattling in his chest like loose gravel.\n\n\"You think?\" The man, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by sun and worry, didn't look up from the worn photograph he clutched in his calloused hand. A faded image of a woman with eyes the color of a storm-tossed sea and a smile that promised a warmth long gone.\n\n\"Yeah. I mean, what was it all for?\" The boy stubbed out the cigarette on the floor, the glowing ember a fleeting defiance in the gloom. \"They said it'd be different. Said we'd bring freedom, democracy, all that shit. But it's just... ash.\"\n\nThe man nodded, the photograph clutched tight. \"They always say that. But the only thing they bring is dust and bone.\"\n\nSilence settled in the room, heavy and thick like the smoke that hung in the air. Outside, the wind howled like a wounded animal, whipping the dust into frenzied dances. \n\n\"I hate it,\" the boy whispered, his voice barely audible above the wind. \"I hate this place, this world. I hate that I might die here, with nothing but ash for company.\"\n\nThe man placed the photograph down on a dusty table, his eyes distant, lost in a memory that burned brighter than the dying embers of the world. \"There's always somewhere else,\" he said, his voice a brittle whisper. \"Somewhere beyond the dust, beyond the ash. There's always hope.\"\n\nThe boy looked at him, his eyes filled with a weariness that belied his years. \"Hope?\" he scoffed. \"Hope's a luxury we can't afford.\" \n\nThe man reached out, his hand rough and calloused, and placed it on the boy's shoulder. \"No,\" he said, his voice firm despite the tremors that shook his body. \"Hope is the only thing we have left.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of it all.  The wind, it rasped and sighed through the skeletal trees, carrying the grit of broken things.  Yeah, he felt it. The discrimination.  Cut deep, like a bone-knife. Not just for the women, though they bore the brunt.  A sickness in the marrow, the way the world saw things.\n\nHe thought of the women, trapped behind the glass roof, invisible to the men above.  Qualified, but never chosen.  Their dreams choked by the dust of history.  And the men, hemmed in too, by expectations like iron bars.  The stay-at-home dads, their hands calloused not from labor but from yearning,  looked upon with suspicion, their souls branded as lesser.\n\nThen there was the fashion, a world of brittle beauty where men who dared to dream in silks and satins were met with scorn.  \"Don't tell me about fashion, son,\" they'd sneer, \"you don't know the first thing about a woman's heart.\"  They were blind, these men, to the subtle whispers of style, the language of cloth and thread.\n\nIt was a slow burn, this injustice.  A fire smoldering under the ashes of a world that refused to see.  Change, it was a hard thing to come by.  But maybe, just maybe, a seed of understanding could take root in the barren soil.  Maybe a whisper of empathy could pierce the thick fog of prejudice.  Maybe, someday, the world would see the men and women beyond the labels, beyond the expectations, and recognize the truth:  that every soul, regardless of gender, yearned for the same things - love, acceptance, and the freedom to be themselves.",
            "The air hung thick with the smoke of things unsaid, of arguments half-remembered. Legalized, they called it. Decriminalized.  A word like cheap tobacco, meant to soothe the rough edges. He knew what it meant though. A ticket, maybe a fine. A blot on the record, a shadow that clung to you like dust. But the boy wouldn't understand. He was young, still wet behind the ears, trusting in the world's promises.\n\nHe thought about the cost, the hollow echoes of it all. The money spent to lock men up, to drag them through the system, to feed them to the maw of the state. And for what? A joint? A puff of smoke? It was a fool's errand, a waste of breath.\n\nDenver, they said. A place with open hearts and open minds. Where the air itself reeked of change, of a willingness to turn the page. But even there,  the taste of it was bitter. Like a promise whispered in the dark, doubted from the start.\n\nHe thought of the lake, the stillness of it, the way the sun bled into the water.  His uncle, weathered and silent, pulling a tree stump from the depths. A day spent in the quiet, the only sound the scrape of oars against wood. A memory, fading like the smell of woodsmoke on the wind.\n\nMarijuana. It wasn't just about the weed itself. It was about control.  About power. About the lines drawn in the sand, the boundaries that separated the haves from the have-nots.\n\nHe looked at the boy, who was still young enough to believe in fairytales. A flicker of something in his eyes, a question he didn't dare voice. He knew those questions would come. The boy would learn, in time, the harsh truths of the world. But for now, he would hold onto the illusions, the fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, things could be better.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  A shadow fell across the cracked pavement. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice a rasp. \"Because tradition binds, it holds a man to the earth. Like some ancient root. But the wind changes, and the river bends. To be rooted is to be still, to be vulnerable.\" He paused, his gaze fixed on a distant point beyond the skeletal remains of buildings. \"The weight of it, though. The expectation. It can smother a man. A man has to breathe.\"\n\nHe remembered the cold stone of the church pews, the scent of incense, the weight of the priest's gaze. \"They speak of love, of acceptance. But the church itself is a cage. Small and narrow, with bars of scripture and dogma. They judge those who fall outside the lines, who dare to question.\"  His hand clenched, knuckles white. \"My father, he was different. He sought light in the wrong places. They wouldn't bridge the gap, wouldn't accept his kind. No love there, just judgment.\"\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his eyes reflecting the dust-choked sky. \"They say you must be perfect, but perfection is a lie. A brittle thing, easily shattered. And what of those who stumble? Those who yearn for something more? They are cast out, left to wander in the wilderness of their own doubts.\"\n\nThe boy shifted, his silence a heavy weight. \"They say love is the answer,\" the man continued, his voice a low murmur. \"But love cannot exist without acceptance. Without understanding.  Without the courage to look beyond the surface, beyond the rigid rules, and see the human heart.\"",
            "The line blurred. Where did one stop and the other begin? Church and state. Right and wrong.  Two souls bound, two souls adrift.  It was a knot that twisted tighter with every word spoken, every heart felt. This wasn't some tidy debate. This was the marrow of the matter.  \n\nWas it a sacrament or a contract?  A whispered prayer in a dim church or a line scratched on a government form?  Didn't matter. Didn't it come down to two souls seeking shelter, a haven in the storm? \n\nShould the hand of the state reach into the sanctity of vows?  Or was it a matter of flesh and blood, a union recognized by the very act of joining? \n\nBaptism didn't bring tax breaks, not a single one. It didn't grant a special place at the table.  So why then, was marriage different?  Why this insistence on defining love by the weight of a law?\n\nTwo souls. Two hearts.  A shared breath. Wasn't that enough?  Didn't the government have its own burdens to bear, its own line in the sand to draw?\n\nCivil unions.  That felt closer, more honest.  No pretense, no grand pronouncements. Just two souls saying, \"Here we are.  Here we stand.\"\n\nAnd what of the states?  They clamored for their own truths, their own versions of right and wrong.  But if they could find common ground, wouldn't that be a victory?  \n\nA federal law, a beacon of shared understanding.  But an amendment?  Oh, no.  The Constitution. Sacred. Untouchable.  To sacrifice its sanctity for this?  To enshrine division in its hallowed halls?\n\nIt wasn't right. It wasn't just. It was a wound dug deep into the fabric of the nation.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of old beliefs, the scent of sulfur and regret.  Homosexuality, it was a thing whispered in the shadows, a question mark etched on the face of the land.  Raised under a roof of hymns and scripture, the notion was a tangled knot in his gut, a discord in the melody of his upbringing. He had friends, yes, souls bound by laughter and shared secrets, their laughter echoing in the hollows of his memories. Friends who walked a path he couldn't quite comprehend, a path paved with whispers and stolen glances.\n\nHe didn't understand it, not truly. But he saw the pain in their eyes, the ache for acceptance, the yearning for a love that mirrored his own. And in that, he saw a reflection of the human need, a longing for connection that transcended the boundaries of the flesh.  \n\nThe law, he felt, should be a shield, not a sword. To impose his vision, his rigid notions, on others, that felt wrong.  States, these microcosms of America, should be the arbiters of their own fate, allowed to shape their own destinies.  After all, wasn't it the right of each soul to choose its own path, to seek its own truth, even if it lay beyond the boundaries of his understanding?\n\nHe thought of the old man, his uncle, weathered and set in his ways, his pipe perpetually clenched between his teeth. A man who believed in the sanctity of tradition, in the unyielding grip of the past. But even the old man, with his stoic silence and unblinking eyes, had a flicker of humanity in his gaze, a recognition of the inherent worth of every human being.\n\nHe wished he could offer more, a clearer answer, a solution that would mend the fractured heart of the nation. But all he had were these fragments of thought, these whispered echoes in the vast emptiness of uncertainty.  \n\nFor the answers, he knew, lay not in the pronouncements of men, but in the quiet spaces between the lines, in the shared humanity that bound them all together, despite their differences.",
            "The boy shuffled closer, his breath a thin mist in the cold.  \"They're watching us,\" he said, eyes narrowed.  His voice was a rasp, like dry leaves skittering on pavement.\n\n\"They're always watching,\" the man said, his gaze fixed on the bleached horizon. The world was a canvas of ash, the sky a pale, bruised thing.  \"But they can't see everything.\"\n\nThe boy's face, gaunt and pale, was etched with worry. \"What if they find us?\"\n\nThe man tightened his grip on the rusted pistol tucked into his belt. \"Then we'll walk on.\"\n\nThey had been moving south for weeks, their path a jagged scar across the barren landscape.  The boy didn't ask questions anymore. He just walked, his small hand clutching the man's, his gaze fixed on the road ahead.  They lived in the silence of the road, the whisper of the wind through the skeletal trees, the rasp of their own breaths.\n\nHe remembered a time before. A time of warmth and light, of laughter and the smell of rain on dry earth.  But that time was gone, swallowed by the ash and the silence. Now, the world was a wasteland, a testament to some forgotten apocalypse.\n\nThey had found the city by chance, a skeletal monument to a vanished world. Buildings rose like broken teeth against the gray sky, windows empty sockets staring out at the desolation.  There was nothing left inside, only dust and the ghosts of memories.\n\nHe had stopped the boy from going inside. \"Remember what I told you,\" he had said, his voice a low growl. \"Don't touch anything. Don't look too closely.\"\n\nThe boy had nodded, eyes wide and wary.\n\nThey had found shelter in a ruined church, its stained-glass windows shattered, its walls scarred with graffiti.  The air was thick with the smell of decay, but it was a dry, brittle decay, like the husk of something long dead.\n\nThe boy slept restlessly, his nightmares echoing in the silence. The man sat beside him, hand resting on the boy's shoulder, a silent promise.  He would protect him.  He would keep him safe.\n\nHe would keep the darkness at bay.",
            "The dust of it all. War. The way it clung to him, a memory the color of ash. At first, the fires of September had burned bright in his gut, a need for retribution. To strike back against that darkness, to repay in kind. Like a fevered dream, the thought of it had seemed clear, righteous. To go over and make them pay. \n\nBut now, the embers had cooled. The heat had turned to a hollow ache. He saw the flaws in the plan, the cracks in the foundation. They’d gone in blind, driven by rage, unprepared for the tangled roots of the place. A tangled mess of history and hate, a land where men fought not for ideals but for scraps, for survival.\n\nHe thought about the faces, the eyes that stared back from the dust-choked streets. How could they understand? How could they be understood? They were caught in a cycle, a endless loop of violence. Us against them, them against us. He couldn’t reach them, couldn’t offer them anything but more of the same.\n\nIt wasn't their fault, he realized. Not entirely. But it wasn't his fault either. He'd been a pawn, a cog in a machine that had ground them all down. And now, the machine kept turning, fueled by anger and fear. \n\nHe looked out at the horizon, a vast emptiness under the sun-bleached sky. What was the point? What had they achieved? He didn't know. He only knew that the war had taken something from him, something he couldn't get back. He saw a flicker of ash in the wind, a ghost of the fires that had consumed so much.\n\nHe turned away, the weight of it all pressing down on his chest.  It was time to walk away. Leave the dust and the ashes behind. \n\nHe had to. For himself."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, it needs changing. Its ways, they're as old as dust. They say the flock is thinning, and maybe that's because the shepherd ain't looking in the right direction.  You can't hold onto things like they're buried in stone. Things like marriage, like a woman's place, like the blood of the unborn - they ain't set in concrete. Times change. \n\nTake marriage, for instance. Loving two of the same kind, it don't feel wrong to me. Feels like God made us all with a need to love, to share our lives. And that ain't no sin.  Then there's the matter of birth control, of a woman's right over her own body.  The Church says it's against God's will, but who made them the judge? God gave them free will, didn't he?\n\nFolks are leaving, you see. They can't swallow the old ways anymore. They want something more, something that speaks to the world they live in. The Church needs to open its eyes, see the world for what it is, not what it was.",
            "The boy’s words hung thin in the air, sharp as broken glass. A question. A truth laid bare. He didn't know what to say.  What could he say?  That love was a river, flowing sometimes in strange and unexpected channels? That the heart, a dark lodge in the chest, beat to its own drum?  He'd seen the boy’s eyes, clear and blue as a winter sky,  searching his face for an answer.  There was no easy answer.  Just the silence, heavy and thick as ash.\n\nHe'd seen men, his own father among them, wrestled with this thing, this truth. Their words, tangled like roots in the dirt, choked on the unspoken.  There was a fear in their eyes, a fear of the unknown, a fear of what they couldn't understand.\n\nBut the boy, he was young, innocent. He didn't see the darkness, the fear, the hate that coiled in the world's gut. He just saw the truth. Pure and simple.\n\nHe looked at the boy, his small hand clutching his own. The lightness of his touch, the innocence in his face, it cut through the lies, the whispers, the fear.  It was a truth he couldn't deny.\n\nHe squeezed the boy's hand.  \"It's right,\" he said, his voice rough, \"It's right to love.\"",
            "The road stretched out ahead, a black ribbon frayed at the edges by the dust. The boy walked beside him, legs thin and pale in the sun. They were headed south, chasing the ghost of warmth. \n\n\"Will it get warmer?\" The boy's voice was small, lost in the wind that scoured the plains.\n\nThe man didn't answer. He squinted at the horizon, searching for something, anything, that might hold the promise of respite. \n\nHe thought of the man in the white suit, the one who'd said, \"Marriage is a sacred covenant between a man and a woman.\" Words meant to bind, meant to exclude. But what of the covenants forged in the crucible of shared hardship, the bond forged in the ashes of a world gone cold?\n\nHe thought of the woman in the church pew, her eyes brimming with righteous anger. \"It's unnatural,\" she'd hissed, \"an abomination against God.\" But what of the love that bloomed in the heart of a storm, the tenderness that found solace in shared fear?\n\nHe thought of the boy, his hand tucked tight in his own. He saw the question in the boy's eyes, a reflection of the question that gnawed at him too. Was their love, their bond, less valid because it didn't fit the mold? Was it less worthy of protection, of the simple dignity that came with a legal name, a shared future?\n\n\"We'll be warm,\" he finally said, his voice rough with the dust of the road. It was a promise whispered on the wind, a prayer for a dawn that might bring not just warmth, but understanding.",
            "The boy spoke. Said it was wrong. To keep something locked away just ‘cause it was forbidden. Like some kind of sin.  \n\nHe’d seen it in the pharmacy. The vials. The bottles. Rows and rows of things that could cure and solace and hurt. Things the law said were good and things it said were bad. But the line was thin.  \n\n“Just because they say ‘no’ doesn’t mean it ain’t right,” the boy said.\n\nHe thought about it. The boy was young, eyes still bright with a kind of innocence. But he knew the weight of a bottle. The power held in a single pill.\n\n“There are things that help,” he said. “Doctors use ‘em. But some are dangerous. Some are meant for people in need, not for just anyone.”\n\nThe boy frowned. “But what if the need ain’t for a doctor?”\n\nHe stopped. Didn’t know how to answer that. \n\nHe knew the boy was talking about the herb. The green smoke that curled in the night, the smell that lingered in the air. He’d seen the way it calmed the old man, the way it eased the pain in his mother’s bones. \n\nHe’d seen the way it made people forget.\n\n“It’s a slippery slope,” he said finally. “One step here, another there. Before you know it, you’re drowning in darkness.”\n\nThe boy shook his head. “Maybe the darkness is what they’re afraid of.”",
            "The church, it’s changed. Not the way you might think, not with some grand upheaval or revolution. More like the slow, patient rot of an old thing, crumbling from the inside out. When I was a girl, Sundays meant lace and silk, little shoes that pinched and purses that clutched a rosary. We’d all be there, God’s finest, in the pews, faces solemn, voices hushed. Now?  Jeans and khakis. Flip-flops in the summer. Families rushing in, hair tangled, kids whining. They call it \"teen mass,\" a quick thirty minutes to get it over with. \n\nPeople talk about the scandals, the darkness at the heart.  They say maybe things would be different if there were women priests, if the men could walk with wives by their side. But what good are rules against the devil in a man’s heart? There are married men who do bad things. It ain't tied to the collar or the vow of celibacy. It's something deeper, something dark and twisted. \n\nThey say you can’t hide something like that, that it’ll come out. Maybe. Or maybe it’ll fester, hidden away like a wound that never heals. Maybe the church, like the world, is just a place where darkness dwells, waiting for its chance.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of a broken world. He'd seen it all before, the lies, the blood, the ash settling like a shroud. September's grief, a raw wound still bleeding.  They'd been told of a monster, a phantom threat, a devil in the desert. A puppet master pulling strings, a hand reaching for the heavens.  But the monster, it turned out, wasn't a man. It was the lie itself, a serpent coiled in the heart of power, its venom seeping into the bones of the nation.\n\nHe remembered the words, the man in the uniform, his voice a rasping echo in the suffocating air. Weapons of mass destruction.  A threat to freedom. A just cause. Lies spun from the same thread as the smoke rising from the ruins of a city devoured by fire.\n\nPowell, the general, his face etched with the weariness of a man who'd seen too much, too late. He'd stood before the world, a salesman peddling a poisoned truth. Now, even he admitted the charade, the faintest whisper of regret in his voice.\n\nMalfeasance. Impeachment. Empty words against the tide of blood. A disregard for the Constitution, a casual dismantling of the very foundations of their world. The twilight of democracy, a slow, agonizing descent into darkness.\n\nHe thought of the young men, sent to fight a phantom, their dreams swallowed by the desert sand.  Their mothers, their fathers, their sisters, their wives, left to pick up the pieces of shattered lives.  \n\nThe war, a festering wound, oozing its poison into the world. A brutal, senseless conflict, fueled by greed and fear. The echo of gunfire, the distant screams, a symphony of destruction.\n\nAnd now, a fragile peace, a patchwork of alliances stitched together with threads of hope and despair. A government teetering on the brink, a nation fractured and bleeding. The old man shook his head, a silent lament for a world gone astray.",
            "The air was thick with dust, the silence broken only by the rasp of wind across the cracked earth. He spoke in a low voice, a monotone born of weary acceptance. \"It don't feel right, this whole affair. Like a fever dream, chasing shadows.\"  \n\nHe paused, his gaze distant, lost in the ash-choked horizon. \"They say it's about justice, about payback for what happened. But it's more like a hunger, a need to prove something, to stick it to them.\"\n\nHis words were tight, measured, like stones dropped into a well. \"They say it's about democracy, about bringing light to a dark place. But the light ain't taking hold, just burnin' away what little's left.\" \n\nHe ran a hand through his hair, the gesture tired, defeated. \"It's like we're tryin' to build a church on a foundation of dust. The wind just blows it all away.\"\n\nA bitterness laced his voice. \"They say it's about oil, about security. But the oil's black gold, and the security's a fleeting thing. The only thing real are the dead, the ones who don't come home.\"\n\nHe looked at the sun, a pale disc in the gray sky, and spat. \"I don't know what the answer is, what the point is anymore. It just feels like a slow, grinding death, for everyone involved.\"\n\nHe fell silent, the words hanging heavy in the dust-filled air.",
            "The road stretched on, gray and broken, coated in the ash of some long-gone fire.  He knew the boy wouldn't understand the words, wouldn't grasp the weight of them, but he'd say them anyway. \"Separation of church and state,\" he'd murmur, the words tasting like dust in his mouth. \"Writ large in the book, right there in black and white.\"\n\nThe boy, he was young, eyes still bright with the light of innocence.  He wouldn't see the darkness that clung to these things, the shadows that stretched long and silent over the land.  How could he? He saw only the world as it was, the sun beating down on the cracked earth, the wind whispering through the skeletal remains of trees.\n\nBut the man, he saw the ghosts. He saw the hands reaching from the ground, clawing at the sky. He saw the faces in the ash, etched with the pain of a world gone mad. He saw the hunger in the eyes of men, the endless hunger for power, for control.\n\nAnd he knew, deep in the bone, that this push for a new law, this attempt to bind the church and the state together, it was a seed of that hunger. It was a step closer to the abyss.\n\n\"They want to take away our freedom,\" he'd tell the boy, his voice rough with the grit of the road. \"They want to tell us what to think, what to believe. But the book, the book says different. It says we have a right to our own faith.\"\n\nHe knew the boy wouldn't understand all the words, but he'd feel the weight of them. He'd feel the fear, the desperation that gnawed at the man's soul.  And in that shared fear, in that silent communion, they would find a kind of solace. A fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, the darkness wouldn't win.",
            "The dust settled on the cracked asphalt. A silence hung over the ruins of what had once been a city, thick as the ash that choked the air. It was the kind of silence that pressed in on a man, a silence that spoke of things long gone and things never to be. He didn't know if he'd ever seen the sun in its full light again, not since the world had turned to ash.\n\nHe kept the pistol close. Always close. The boy walked beside him, his face pale beneath the grime, his eyes wide and watchful. They were moving south, toward a country that promised nothing but more dust and more silence. He didn't know if there was anything left worth finding, but he kept walking, driven by a whisper, a promise of something beyond the endless gray.\n\n\"What happened here?\" the boy asked, his voice small and thin against the wind.\n\n\"The world forgets,\" he said, his voice a rough rasp. \"It's hard to remember what it was like before.\" He looked at the boy, his eyes shadowed. \"Before the fire.\"\n\nThey moved through the skeletal remains of buildings, past twisted metal and shattered glass. The air was thick with the smell of decay and the bitter tang of dust. He stopped at a boarded-up storefront, its windows cracked and vacant.\n\n\"What was this place?\"\n\n\"A store,\" he said, his gaze drifting to a faded sign that hung precariously from the wall. \"They sold things people wanted.\"\n\nThe boy frowned. \"What kind of things?\"\n\nHe couldn't answer. He didn't remember. He could only feel the weight of the silence, the emptiness that stretched before them like a vast, unending desert.\n\nThey continued on, their footsteps echoing in the stillness. The boy walked on, his small hand clutching his father's. He didn't question anymore. He had learned to hold onto the hand that held him, to trust the silence that surrounded them.",
            "The air hung thick with it, this business of love. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, he’d seen them all.  He’d seen them in the shadows, eyes locked like hunted things. He’d seen them in the light, hands intertwined, a quiet defiance in their gaze.  Love, he thought, a word worn thin by the world.  A word that carried the weight of judgment, of fear.  But in the end, it was just a thing, a pull, a fire that burned in the belly. \n\nHe’d seen it in the faces of children, too, a innocence he couldn’t remember. A boy with his arm around another boy, a girl with her head on a girl’s shoulder.  The same look he’d seen in his own father’s eyes, years ago, on a day the world had felt different, maybe even hopeful.\n\nHe knew the world tried to cage it, this love, to teach it a place in the shadows. To say it was wrong, unnatural.  But the man knew better. He’d seen the world unravel, seen the darkness creep in.  He’d seen the laws laid down, the lines drawn. But love, that fire, it wouldn’t be tamed. It burned on, a defiant spark in the growing gloom.\n\nHe’d seen it in the eyes of those who clung to the old ways, the fear, the anger.  A fear of what they didn't understand, a hatred born of ignorance.  But the man saw the truth: love was the only thing strong enough to fight the darkness.  It was the only thing worth fighting for.",
            "The words hang in the air, frail and echoing. A public forum, he says.  The net, a sprawling web, casting its shadow over every act, every thought.  You put it out there, and it sticks. A stain on the soul of the world.  He speaks of shootings, of violence, the kind that stains the air thick and heavy.  Someone will hear, someone will see.  The school, forced to act, to protect, to police the dreams of the young.  A whisper, a rumour, a joke skewed in the harsh light of day.  An experiment gone wrong, a sociology lesson turned chilling.  He remembers, remembers the boy, the boy's laughter in the face of a storm. On Facebook, on Myspace, words bleed into the void.  There is no privacy, no sanctuary.  The past, the future, all flattened by the cold eye of the screen.  The school, a fortress under siege, forced to sift through the digital detritus, searching for the spark, the flicker of danger.  He speaks of invasion, of boundaries breached, of the teacher’s gaze, predatory and unwelcome, lurking in the shadows of the internet.  But the words fall flat, hollow.  For in the digital world, there is no sanctuary, no hidden corner where secrets can lie undisturbed.   The internet, a judge, jury, and executioner, passes its sentence on everyone.",
            "The war, it stretches on. A wound that festers. The purpose, once clear, now a dim memory. A ghost of something good, something righteous. But the years have bled it dry. Left us chasing shadows. Proving something, to whom? To ourselves? A hollow victory, a pyrrhic cost.\n\nHe remembers the talk at the start. Democracy, a righteous cause. A hand outstretched to lift a people from tyranny. But somewhere along the line, the whispers turned to shouts. The motives, once veiled in patriotism, now nakedly exposed. The past, a tangled skein of oil fields and family feuds, cast a long, dark shadow over the present.\n\nThis land, this ravaged land, it bears the weight of it all.  The ghosts of fallen soldiers, the hollow eyes of refugees. The stench of dust and death hangs heavy in the air.\n\nIs this what they fought for? This endless, grinding conflict? Once, there was a purpose. Now, there's only the echo of it, a fading drumbeat in the desert wind.\n\nHe sees the faces of the dead, the broken bodies, the shattered dreams. He feels the weight of the world on his shoulders, the burden of a war that never ends.\n\nHe thinks of his own children, their laughter a distant memory. Their futures stolen by a conflict that has consumed everything. He wonders if they will ever know peace.\n\nHe wonders if he will.",
            "The question hung in the air, a moth caught in the dust motes of the room. \n\n\"Uh,\" she began, voice thin as a whisper. \"It was stopped, see, 'cause someone found it online.\"\n\nHe leaned back, the worn wood of the chair groaning beneath him. \"Mmm.\"\n\n\"Online? But Myspace...\" she hesitated, the words catching on her tongue. \"It's, well, it's supposed to be private, isn't it? You have to be friends.\"\n\n\"Friends,\" he echoed, the sound a hollow drumbeat in the silence. \"But isn't that what gives them permission? To see?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" she mumbled, picking at a loose thread on her sleeve. \"It's like, if you put it out there...\"\n\n\"You give it over,\" he finished, his voice a low rumble.\n\nA silence fell, thick and heavy as the dust that coated everything.\n\n\"But what if it was good,\" she finally said, her voice barely audible. \"What if someone saw it, and it meant saving a life?\"\n\n\"Tough,\" he said, the word a stone dropped in the stillness. \"You can't have some soul policing every profile, watching for trouble.\"\n\n\"But...\" she started, then stopped, her face pale and drawn. \"It's like, what if they were just looking, accidentally?\"\n\n\"Accidentally,\" he repeated, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. \"Or looking for something, a sign... \"\n\nHe trailed off, his eyes distant, seeing something beyond the chipped paint on the walls, something dark and terrible.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he said finally, his voice a rasp, \"what you put out there... it finds its way back.\"",
            "The boy sat with a crumpled pack of cigarettes in his hand, staring at the dust motes dancing in the light filtering through the cracked windowpane. \"It's all gone to shit, ain't it?\" he rasped, the words rattling in his chest like loose gravel.\n\n\"You think?\" The man, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by sun and worry, didn't look up from the worn photograph he clutched in his calloused hand. A faded image of a woman with eyes the color of a storm-tossed sea and a smile that promised a warmth long gone.\n\n\"Yeah. I mean, what was it all for?\" The boy stubbed out the cigarette on the floor, the glowing ember a fleeting defiance in the gloom. \"They said it'd be different. Said we'd bring freedom, democracy, all that shit. But it's just... ash.\"\n\nThe man nodded, the photograph clutched tight. \"They always say that. But the only thing they bring is dust and bone.\"\n\nSilence settled in the room, heavy and thick like the smoke that hung in the air. Outside, the wind howled like a wounded animal, whipping the dust into frenzied dances. \n\n\"I hate it,\" the boy whispered, his voice barely audible above the wind. \"I hate this place, this world. I hate that I might die here, with nothing but ash for company.\"\n\nThe man placed the photograph down on a dusty table, his eyes distant, lost in a memory that burned brighter than the dying embers of the world. \"There's always somewhere else,\" he said, his voice a brittle whisper. \"Somewhere beyond the dust, beyond the ash. There's always hope.\"\n\nThe boy looked at him, his eyes filled with a weariness that belied his years. \"Hope?\" he scoffed. \"Hope's a luxury we can't afford.\" \n\nThe man reached out, his hand rough and calloused, and placed it on the boy's shoulder. \"No,\" he said, his voice firm despite the tremors that shook his body. \"Hope is the only thing we have left.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of it all.  The wind, it rasped and sighed through the skeletal trees, carrying the grit of broken things.  Yeah, he felt it. The discrimination.  Cut deep, like a bone-knife. Not just for the women, though they bore the brunt.  A sickness in the marrow, the way the world saw things.\n\nHe thought of the women, trapped behind the glass roof, invisible to the men above.  Qualified, but never chosen.  Their dreams choked by the dust of history.  And the men, hemmed in too, by expectations like iron bars.  The stay-at-home dads, their hands calloused not from labor but from yearning,  looked upon with suspicion, their souls branded as lesser.\n\nThen there was the fashion, a world of brittle beauty where men who dared to dream in silks and satins were met with scorn.  \"Don't tell me about fashion, son,\" they'd sneer, \"you don't know the first thing about a woman's heart.\"  They were blind, these men, to the subtle whispers of style, the language of cloth and thread.\n\nIt was a slow burn, this injustice.  A fire smoldering under the ashes of a world that refused to see.  Change, it was a hard thing to come by.  But maybe, just maybe, a seed of understanding could take root in the barren soil.  Maybe a whisper of empathy could pierce the thick fog of prejudice.  Maybe, someday, the world would see the men and women beyond the labels, beyond the expectations, and recognize the truth:  that every soul, regardless of gender, yearned for the same things - love, acceptance, and the freedom to be themselves.",
            "The air hung thick with the smoke of things unsaid, of arguments half-remembered. Legalized, they called it. Decriminalized.  A word like cheap tobacco, meant to soothe the rough edges. He knew what it meant though. A ticket, maybe a fine. A blot on the record, a shadow that clung to you like dust. But the boy wouldn't understand. He was young, still wet behind the ears, trusting in the world's promises.\n\nHe thought about the cost, the hollow echoes of it all. The money spent to lock men up, to drag them through the system, to feed them to the maw of the state. And for what? A joint? A puff of smoke? It was a fool's errand, a waste of breath.\n\nDenver, they said. A place with open hearts and open minds. Where the air itself reeked of change, of a willingness to turn the page. But even there,  the taste of it was bitter. Like a promise whispered in the dark, doubted from the start.\n\nHe thought of the lake, the stillness of it, the way the sun bled into the water.  His uncle, weathered and silent, pulling a tree stump from the depths. A day spent in the quiet, the only sound the scrape of oars against wood. A memory, fading like the smell of woodsmoke on the wind.\n\nMarijuana. It wasn't just about the weed itself. It was about control.  About power. About the lines drawn in the sand, the boundaries that separated the haves from the have-nots.\n\nHe looked at the boy, who was still young enough to believe in fairytales. A flicker of something in his eyes, a question he didn't dare voice. He knew those questions would come. The boy would learn, in time, the harsh truths of the world. But for now, he would hold onto the illusions, the fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, things could be better.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  A shadow fell across the cracked pavement. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice a rasp. \"Because tradition binds, it holds a man to the earth. Like some ancient root. But the wind changes, and the river bends. To be rooted is to be still, to be vulnerable.\" He paused, his gaze fixed on a distant point beyond the skeletal remains of buildings. \"The weight of it, though. The expectation. It can smother a man. A man has to breathe.\"\n\nHe remembered the cold stone of the church pews, the scent of incense, the weight of the priest's gaze. \"They speak of love, of acceptance. But the church itself is a cage. Small and narrow, with bars of scripture and dogma. They judge those who fall outside the lines, who dare to question.\"  His hand clenched, knuckles white. \"My father, he was different. He sought light in the wrong places. They wouldn't bridge the gap, wouldn't accept his kind. No love there, just judgment.\"\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his eyes reflecting the dust-choked sky. \"They say you must be perfect, but perfection is a lie. A brittle thing, easily shattered. And what of those who stumble? Those who yearn for something more? They are cast out, left to wander in the wilderness of their own doubts.\"\n\nThe boy shifted, his silence a heavy weight. \"They say love is the answer,\" the man continued, his voice a low murmur. \"But love cannot exist without acceptance. Without understanding.  Without the courage to look beyond the surface, beyond the rigid rules, and see the human heart.\"",
            "The line blurred. Where did one stop and the other begin? Church and state. Right and wrong.  Two souls bound, two souls adrift.  It was a knot that twisted tighter with every word spoken, every heart felt. This wasn't some tidy debate. This was the marrow of the matter.  \n\nWas it a sacrament or a contract?  A whispered prayer in a dim church or a line scratched on a government form?  Didn't matter. Didn't it come down to two souls seeking shelter, a haven in the storm? \n\nShould the hand of the state reach into the sanctity of vows?  Or was it a matter of flesh and blood, a union recognized by the very act of joining? \n\nBaptism didn't bring tax breaks, not a single one. It didn't grant a special place at the table.  So why then, was marriage different?  Why this insistence on defining love by the weight of a law?\n\nTwo souls. Two hearts.  A shared breath. Wasn't that enough?  Didn't the government have its own burdens to bear, its own line in the sand to draw?\n\nCivil unions.  That felt closer, more honest.  No pretense, no grand pronouncements. Just two souls saying, \"Here we are.  Here we stand.\"\n\nAnd what of the states?  They clamored for their own truths, their own versions of right and wrong.  But if they could find common ground, wouldn't that be a victory?  \n\nA federal law, a beacon of shared understanding.  But an amendment?  Oh, no.  The Constitution. Sacred. Untouchable.  To sacrifice its sanctity for this?  To enshrine division in its hallowed halls?\n\nIt wasn't right. It wasn't just. It was a wound dug deep into the fabric of the nation.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of old beliefs, the scent of sulfur and regret.  Homosexuality, it was a thing whispered in the shadows, a question mark etched on the face of the land.  Raised under a roof of hymns and scripture, the notion was a tangled knot in his gut, a discord in the melody of his upbringing. He had friends, yes, souls bound by laughter and shared secrets, their laughter echoing in the hollows of his memories. Friends who walked a path he couldn't quite comprehend, a path paved with whispers and stolen glances.\n\nHe didn't understand it, not truly. But he saw the pain in their eyes, the ache for acceptance, the yearning for a love that mirrored his own. And in that, he saw a reflection of the human need, a longing for connection that transcended the boundaries of the flesh.  \n\nThe law, he felt, should be a shield, not a sword. To impose his vision, his rigid notions, on others, that felt wrong.  States, these microcosms of America, should be the arbiters of their own fate, allowed to shape their own destinies.  After all, wasn't it the right of each soul to choose its own path, to seek its own truth, even if it lay beyond the boundaries of his understanding?\n\nHe thought of the old man, his uncle, weathered and set in his ways, his pipe perpetually clenched between his teeth. A man who believed in the sanctity of tradition, in the unyielding grip of the past. But even the old man, with his stoic silence and unblinking eyes, had a flicker of humanity in his gaze, a recognition of the inherent worth of every human being.\n\nHe wished he could offer more, a clearer answer, a solution that would mend the fractured heart of the nation. But all he had were these fragments of thought, these whispered echoes in the vast emptiness of uncertainty.  \n\nFor the answers, he knew, lay not in the pronouncements of men, but in the quiet spaces between the lines, in the shared humanity that bound them all together, despite their differences.",
            "The boy shuffled closer, his breath a thin mist in the cold.  \"They're watching us,\" he said, eyes narrowed.  His voice was a rasp, like dry leaves skittering on pavement.\n\n\"They're always watching,\" the man said, his gaze fixed on the bleached horizon. The world was a canvas of ash, the sky a pale, bruised thing.  \"But they can't see everything.\"\n\nThe boy's face, gaunt and pale, was etched with worry. \"What if they find us?\"\n\nThe man tightened his grip on the rusted pistol tucked into his belt. \"Then we'll walk on.\"\n\nThey had been moving south for weeks, their path a jagged scar across the barren landscape.  The boy didn't ask questions anymore. He just walked, his small hand clutching the man's, his gaze fixed on the road ahead.  They lived in the silence of the road, the whisper of the wind through the skeletal trees, the rasp of their own breaths.\n\nHe remembered a time before. A time of warmth and light, of laughter and the smell of rain on dry earth.  But that time was gone, swallowed by the ash and the silence. Now, the world was a wasteland, a testament to some forgotten apocalypse.\n\nThey had found the city by chance, a skeletal monument to a vanished world. Buildings rose like broken teeth against the gray sky, windows empty sockets staring out at the desolation.  There was nothing left inside, only dust and the ghosts of memories.\n\nHe had stopped the boy from going inside. \"Remember what I told you,\" he had said, his voice a low growl. \"Don't touch anything. Don't look too closely.\"\n\nThe boy had nodded, eyes wide and wary.\n\nThey had found shelter in a ruined church, its stained-glass windows shattered, its walls scarred with graffiti.  The air was thick with the smell of decay, but it was a dry, brittle decay, like the husk of something long dead.\n\nThe boy slept restlessly, his nightmares echoing in the silence. The man sat beside him, hand resting on the boy's shoulder, a silent promise.  He would protect him.  He would keep him safe.\n\nHe would keep the darkness at bay.",
            "The dust of it all. War. The way it clung to him, a memory the color of ash. At first, the fires of September had burned bright in his gut, a need for retribution. To strike back against that darkness, to repay in kind. Like a fevered dream, the thought of it had seemed clear, righteous. To go over and make them pay. \n\nBut now, the embers had cooled. The heat had turned to a hollow ache. He saw the flaws in the plan, the cracks in the foundation. They’d gone in blind, driven by rage, unprepared for the tangled roots of the place. A tangled mess of history and hate, a land where men fought not for ideals but for scraps, for survival.\n\nHe thought about the faces, the eyes that stared back from the dust-choked streets. How could they understand? How could they be understood? They were caught in a cycle, a endless loop of violence. Us against them, them against us. He couldn’t reach them, couldn’t offer them anything but more of the same.\n\nIt wasn't their fault, he realized. Not entirely. But it wasn't his fault either. He'd been a pawn, a cog in a machine that had ground them all down. And now, the machine kept turning, fueled by anger and fear. \n\nHe looked out at the horizon, a vast emptiness under the sun-bleached sky. What was the point? What had they achieved? He didn't know. He only knew that the war had taken something from him, something he couldn't get back. He saw a flicker of ash in the wind, a ghost of the fires that had consumed so much.\n\nHe turned away, the weight of it all pressing down on his chest.  It was time to walk away. Leave the dust and the ashes behind. \n\nHe had to. For himself."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, it needs changing. Her views, they're set in stone, some of them. Like a granite altar, unyielding. And folks, they're leaving. The flock is thinning. They say it's because the Church, she ain't accepting enough. Not of the times, not of the heart's desires.  She clings to these old ways, these pronouncements against what some call love, against choice, against the flesh.  \n\nThey talk about gay marriage, about abortion, about the use of birth control. These are matters of the soul, of the body, of the way the world unfolds. And the Church, she judges, she condemns.  But folks, they're tired of judgement. They want understanding, they want compassion. \n\nThink of it this way: A child comes to the well, thirsty. But the Church offers only dust.  They need a different kind of water, a deeper well.  They need a Church that reflects the world, not dictates it.\n\nThey say the Church’s stance on these things, it's driving people away. They feel the weight of her condemnation, the chill of her disapproval. And they wander, seeking solace elsewhere. \n\nA young man, he wants to love another man.  The Church says no. A woman, she wants control over her own body. The Church says no.  A couple, they need protection, they plan their children. The Church says no. And they turn away, seeking a haven of acceptance. \n\nThe Church, she's a grand edifice, built on the shoulders of centuries. But her foundation is cracking.  The wind howls through the cracks, carrying whispers of change.  And the people, they're listening. They're wondering, is there room for them, here?",
            "The boy sat there, silence a shroud around him.  He spoke, his voice thin as a whisper in the dry air.  \"Do you think it's right?\"  \n\nThe man squinted at the road, the gray dust motes dancing in the weak light. \"Right?\"  He turned the word over in his mouth, tasting its emptiness. \"What's right anymore, boy? In this world?\"\n\n\"Marriage,\" the boy said, his eyes fixed on the man's face. \"Two men. Or two women. Is that right?\"\n\nThe man looked at the boy, his silence a heavy thing.  He thought of the road stretching ahead, endless and unforgiving, of the ash-choked sky, of the silence that stretched deeper than any canyon.  He thought of the days gone by, of the things he'd seen, the things he'd done, the things he'd lost.  And in the face of all that, the boy's question felt small, insignificant, yet it held a weight that pressed down on him.\n\n\"The world,\" he said finally, his voice rasping, \"the world's gone mad.  It forgets what it used to know.  It forgets what it means to be human.\" He looked back at the boy, his gaze searching. \"But some things,\" he said, \"some things are as old as the hills.  Love.  Loss.  The need to be seen, to be heard.  Maybe,\" he added, his voice barely a whisper, \"maybe that's all that matters.\" \n\nHe didn't say if it was right or wrong.  He didn't have the answers.

            "The road stretched out before him, gray and cracked, a scar across the face of ash. The boy walked beside him, small and thin, his eyes fixed on the ground. They were headed south, driven by a hunger deeper than for food. A hunger for something whole, something salvaged from the wreckage.\n\n\"Why do they say it's wrong?\" the boy asked, his voice barely a whisper against the wind.\n\nThe man looked at him, the boy's face pale and etched with a weariness beyond his years.  \"They say things they don't understand,\" he rasped, his voice dry as dust. \"They fear what they don't know. They cling to shadows.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence between them thick with unspoken truths.  The sun, a pale disc in the smoky sky, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced around them.  They were on the move, always on the move, searching for something they couldn't name.\n\n\"But it's just love, isn't it?\" the boy persisted, his voice trembling. \n\nThe man stopped, pulling a battered photograph from his pocket. It was faded and worn, the edges softened with time. A younger version of himself stared back, a smile creased on his face. Beside him, a woman, her eyes bright with laughter.  The man's throat tightened, the memory a shard of glass in his chest.\n\n\"It's everything,\" he murmured, his voice rough with emotion. \"It's the only thing that matters.\"\n\nThey continued their journey, two solitary figures against the desolate landscape. The wind whispered through the skeletal trees, a mournful dirge for a world lost. They walked on, driven by the faint flicker of hope, the promise of something better, something truer, something worth fighting for.",

They say it rots the mind.\"\n\nThe man, his face worn and shadowed, looked down at him. \"They say a lot of things, boy.  Things that ain't always true.  Just because a thing is outlawed doesn't mean it's poison.  There's good in the world, and there's bad.  It's in the using, boy, not the thing itself.  You see the way they lock away the good things, the things that heal?  They fear what they don't understand.\"\n\nHe paused, his gaze drifting to a dusty vial on the shelf.  \"They lock away the things that ease the pain, the things that quiet the mind.  They keep them hidden, out of reach. But the boy, he saw the truth.  He saw the green leaves, the way they calmed the fevered brow, the way they lifted the weight of the world.  He saw the stories his grandfather told, the tales of ancient cures, of whispered remedies passed down through generations.\"\n\n\"There are things in this world,\" he said, his voice low, \"that the powerful want to keep from us.

            "The church, it’s changed. Not like it used to be. I remember Sundays, the little dresses, shoes to match, a purse too. All of it, every Sunday. Private school, friends there, all of us in our best clothes. Now it’s different. They got this thing, a teen mass. Thirty minutes tops. Folks come straight from the beach, clothes still damp, kids running in late. Even the morning services, the ones I used to dress up for, jeans and khakis are the norm. Khakis ain’t bad, I guess, but… casual. That’s the biggest thing, the casualness.\n\nAs for the rest, the politics of it all, that’s not my concern.\n\nThese things with the priests, the accusations.  It ain’t about marriage, not really. Men get married, they still… they still make those choices. It ain’t the church, it’s the man. Hell, there are other churches, ministers and the like, they get to marry, like on that show, “Seventh Heaven.” If a man wants that life, maybe he should look elsewhere.\n\nI think it’s in their blood, those urges.  Genetics, maybe. You can’t teach that, not really. You can try to hide it, try to bury it, but it’ll always come out. The church had no way of knowing, not in every case anyway. If they did know, and they covered it up, then shame on them. But I think sometimes, they were just blind.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of a lie. The words, they rasped in his throat like gravel. September eleventh, a date etched in ash and blood. A pretext, a twisted justification for a war born of shadows and ambition. They’d told the people of a phantom threat, of weapons of mass destruction, of a nexus with the unseen hand of Bin Laden. All of it a smoke screen.  \n\nThe old man, Powell, now spoke of doubt, of a gnawing uncertainty even as he’d thrust the evidence, or what passed for it, before the world. A betrayal, plain as day, a lie laid bare. Malfeasance, he spat. Impeachable, every goddamn fiber of his being screamed it. The Constitution, tattered and trampled beneath the boots of men drunk on power.\n\nThey’d come to office with war in their eyes, a thirst for vengeance inherited from the father’s legacy. Oil, a siren song whispering promises of wealth and dominance, fueled the fire. A blood vengeance, a scorched earth policy, all justified by a hollow echo of freedom.\n\nHe remembered the lake, the stillness of the water reflecting the twilight sky. A birch trunk, hauled from the depths, a testament to industry and need. The scent of damp wood and pine needles, the rhythmic slap of the oars against the water. A memory sharp against the backdrop of this festering wound.\n\nBut the Iraq war, it gnawed at him, a cancer eating away at the soul. A nation fractured, a people divided, a land consumed by the flames of a lie. The withdrawal, a perilous path, fraught with uncertainty. A fractured nation, teetering on the brink of chaos.\n\nThe UN, a shadow puppet show, strings pulled by unseen hands. A coalition of neighbors, a patchwork solution stitched together with wishful thinking. Sovereignty, a word whispered with fear and trembling. The parliament, a house of cards, collapsing under the weight of its own contradictions. A fractured parliament, a fractured nation, a fractured dream.  \n\nAnd he, a witness to it all, a silent observer to the unraveling. The dust settled, a shroud over a nation buried beneath the weight of its own shattered promises.",
            "The air hung thick and silent, a shroud of dust motes dancing in the wan light. He watched the boy, his brow creased in thought, his words tumbling out in a rush, half-formed, searching for purchase in the empty air.  \"It's pointless, this,\" the boy said, his voice a rasp in the stillness. \"Not a real war, not truly. Just… payback.\"\n\nHe knew the boy spoke of the burning, the smoke-filled skies that had marked their lives since they’d left the highway. The ghost of the towers, a wound etched deep in the national memory.  He nodded, a slow, weary movement, eyes fixed on the cracked asphalt before them. \n\n\"We're trying to build something,\" the boy continued, his voice gaining strength, \"a new world, a better world. But it's like trying to build a house on sand. It won't hold.\"\n\nHe looked away, towards the desolate landscape stretching before them, a canvas of bleached bone and ash. A world stripped bare, its veins of oil now a bitter monument to greed. \n\n\"Democracy,\" he muttered, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. \"A fragile thing, built on hope and fear. It takes root slowly, grows slowly, and can be crushed just as easily.\"\n\nThe boy's gaze fell on him, eyes wide and searching.  \"Are we doing the right thing?\" he asked, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nHe looked back at the boy, his face etched with the lines of a thousand unspoken truths. \"Sometimes,\" he said, his voice rough, \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the silence of things unspoken. A chill, deeper than the autumn wind, settled in the marrow. This talk, this push for a law, it felt wrong. Like a hand reaching in from the shadows to pull at the threads of something holy. The Constitution. It was there, plain as day, the separation. A line drawn in the dust, a boundary between the sacred and the secular. To meddle with this, to try and bend it, it was to invite the darkness in. \n\nThese men, these men with their righteous anger, they spoke of what churches believed, of their Bibles and their God. But they were but a single voice, a single choir in the vast cathedral of faith. To choose their song, their law, over the whispers of others, that was tyranny. A godless act, cloaked in the name of righteousness.\n\nAnd what of the amendment? To change the very fabric of the nation, to fold the church into the state, it was a betrayal of the very foundation upon which this country was built. It wasn't to protect the people, no. It was to bind them, to shackle them to the will of the few.\n\nThis was a matter for the cloisters, for the souls to wrestle with, not for the halls of power. Let them preach their damnation, let them live their lives according to their creed. The government had no place in this. \n\nThe whispers of history warned against this path, against this encroachment. The echoes of empires fallen, of freedoms lost, they rang in the silence. We were better than this. We could be better. \n\nLet the churches hold their councils, let the people pray. This was not a battle to be fought in the courts, in the legislatures, but in the quiet spaces of the heart, in the depths of the soul.",
            "The war in Iraq. A stain on the land, a festering wound. It began with lies, they said. Half-truths spun like gossamer threads, designed to catch the heart of a grieving nation. They said it was about those towers, those twisted metal skeletons reaching for a sky choked with ash. But the truth, it simmered below, a slow burn of greed and an echo of ancient battles fought on this sun-baked soil.\n\nI reckon I've never been one for war. Not a man for violence, not a man for the spilling of blood. The taking of life, it leaves a chill that never truly fades. This war, it felt like a fever dream, a bad dream the world couldn't wake from.  A echo of Vietnam, they called it. A slow, grinding machine that chewed up young men and spat them out, broken and empty.\n\nThey say they were going to bring democracy, a balm for a land torn by strife. But what they found was not the welcoming embrace of freedom, but a tangled web of hatred and resentment. They toppled a tyrant, yes, but in his place, a vacuum. A void filled not with hope, but with the ghosts of whispers, the cries of the dispossessed.\n\nThey tried to impose their will on a land with a history older than time itself. They forgot that change, real change, cannot be forced. It must be coaxed, nurtured, like a fragile seedling in the desert. They came with guns and bombs, and they found only fire.\n\nThey said they had to fight for freedom, for the American way of life. But what they saw in those eyes, those weary, haunted eyes, was not freedom. They saw fear, they saw anger, they saw a reflection of their own humanity warped by the smoke and the blood.\n\nNow, years later, the dust still hasn't settled. The scars remain, etched deep into the fabric of that land, a testament to the folly of men who thought they could remake the world in their own image.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of rain and ash. A silence pressed down, heavy as the dust that coated everything.  He spoke, voice rasping like a dry wind through skeletal trees: \"It's a right,\" he said, the word hanging in the air. \"A right like breathing, like the sun.\" He paused, his eyes fixed on some distant horizon only he could see. \"It's in the blood, in the bones.  Not some choice you make.\"\n\nHe knew the world saw it different.  The world saw a battle, a fight.  But for him, it was simpler.  He'd seen love in the eyes of those two men down the street, in the way they held hands, in the quiet comfort of their shared life. It was the same love he'd seen in his own mother's eyes before she died.  The same love that bound him to the boy beside him now. \n\n\"They try to tell us it's wrong,\" he continued, his voice low. \"Try to say it's unnatural. But the Lord, He made the world. He made all things. And He made love, didn't He?  This ain't no sin. This is just life.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy, his young face filled with a wisdom beyond his years.  \"They try to play God,\" he whispered, his gaze hardening. \"But God ain't about taking away. He's about giving. About love.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy again, a fierce protectiveness rising in his chest. \"And we'll keep giving it,\" he said. \"We'll keep loving. We'll keep fighting for what's right. 'Cause in the end, that's all that matters.\"",
            "The boy’s words hung in the air, a dry rustle of leaves in the wind.  \"When you put something on the internet,” he said, his voice thin as a breaking twig, “it’s… public.”  He paused, searching for the right word. “It’s completely public.”  \n\nThe man watched him, a slow smoke curling from his lips, the light of the dying fire casting his face in shadow. “You can’t,” he said, his voice a low rumble, “unspeak what’s been spoken.”\n\nThe boy’s eyes, wide and shadowed, looked up at him. “I mean, as an R.A., I’ve seen it. You put something out there, it colors people’s thoughts. If you’re talkin’ ‘bout blowin' things up, or shootings…” He trailed off, the fear in his voice palpable.\n\n“Someone’s gonna say somethin’. You can’t put that out there. The internet,” he spat the word out like a curse, “it’s seen by everyone. If you’re friends with someone on Myspace, you get their bulletin. The school didn’t get it from the school. Someone went to the school. They had to act.” He gestured with his hand, a hollow, empty movement.\n\n“They can’t let it sit, God forbid somethin’ happens, they coulda prevented it.”\n\nThe boy nodded, his face pale in the flickering light. “But,” he said, his voice barely a whisper, “you don’t know what to take seriously. Some folks just fool around like that. It could be…” He searched for the words, his brow furrowed. “It could be like that time at school. An experiment gone wrong.”\n\nThe man sighed, the smoke curling upwards. “For a sociology class, or somethin’.”\n\n“And it could also be something real serious,” the boy continued, his voice gaining a sliver of strength. “The thing is, what happened here, someone overheard somethin’ and told the school. Then they checked his Facebook, his friend did, and they saw things, things that might have been a joke, but in light of what happened, became real serious.” \n\nHe looked up at the man, his eyes pleading. “When you put stuff out there, on the internet, there ain’t no privacy. If you don’t want it out there, don’t put it there. If you don’t want people to see it, to think somethin’ of you, you can’t tell them what to think.” He paused, his voice weary. “You can’t tell people what to take seriously or not.”\n\nThe man smoked in silence for a long moment, his gaze fixed on the dying embers.",
            "The war. Drawn out. Too long. Like a fevered dream that won't break.  It began with good intentions, maybe. To right a wrong, to bring light to a darkened place. Democracy, they called it. A fair hand for the people. But the light, it seemed to flicker.  Lost in the smoke and dust.\n\nNow, it feels like something else. A need to prove. To show who's strong. A shadow of old scores settled in the ashes.  The father's whisper, a grudge carried on the wind.\n\nDemocracy, a faded banner.  A justification worn thin. We struck a blow, a quick spark of fire. But the flames, they didn't die.  They smoldered. They crept. The years stretched on, a long, lean shadow. \n\nThe cost, it mounts. Dollars bled into the earth, a river of red.  Our own wounds fester, ignored. Poverty, a hungry beast, gnaws at the edges of our nation. It cries out, but the drums of war drown out its voice.\n\nHow long can we keep this up?  How many sons and daughters must be lost before the echoes of purpose fade away?  They say there must be a victory. A clean break. But what victory is there in a land turned to ash?\n\nThe time has come for us to look back.  To see the faces of the lost, the tears of the weeping mothers. To hear the whisper of the wind through the empty husks of buildings.  It's time to walk away. To heal the wounds, both our own and theirs.  The war has served its purpose. It's time to let it die.",
            "The day bled into the next, the rain a shroud over the world.  He sat across the table from the boy, the cracked plastic surface slick with condensation. The boy shifted, fiddling with the frayed edge of his worn sweater. The silence stretched, thick and heavy as the air. Finally, the boy spoke, his voice a whisper against the hum of the dying storm. \"Can I ask you something?\" \n\nHe looked at the boy, his face drawn and weary. \"Sure, son. What is it?\"\n\n\"About that, uh, about what happened.\" \n\nHe reached out, his hand resting on the boy's shoulder, a gesture both comforting and sorrowful. \"What about it?\" \n\nThe boy hesitated, his eyes downcast. \"Is it, is it bad that someone found out?\"\n\nHe sighed, the sound rasping in his chest. \"Bad?  It depends. What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Like, on Myspace. If someone sees something, can they, can they stop it?\"\n\n\"Stop what?\" \n\n\"You know,\" the boy mumbled, his gaze fixed on the damp table. \"If someone's gonna do something bad, if they say it online.\"\n\nHe reached for the cup of lukewarm coffee, the metal bitter against his tongue. \"The world is full of shadows, son.  Things whispered in the dark. Sometimes those whispers are heard. Sometimes they're not.\"\n\nThe boy looked up, his eyes wide and searching. \"But if someone hears them, can they stop it? Can they make it go away?\"\n\n\"That depends,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly. \"Depends on if they have the will.  Depends if they're willing to face the darkness.\"\n\nThe boy fell silent, the weight of his question hanging in the air.  The rain continued its relentless drumming, a mournful counterpoint to their unspoken conversation.  He knew the boy was too young to understand the complexities of the world. The shadows that lurked beneath the surface, the unspoken truths that festered in the human heart.  But he also knew that the boy was more perceptive than he let on, his young mind already grappling with questions that would haunt him for years to come.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the words catching in his throat like ash.  He shifted, the plastic of the chair scraping against the worn linoleum.  *Hypocritical*, he thought, the word a bitter taste on his tongue.  \"Hate to be part of the chorus,\" he mumbled, \"the ones who just say 'I told you so.'\"  He knew the feeling, the punch of certainty that came with hindsight, the ease of joining the throng.  But it wasn't about that now.\n\nHe looked out the window, the glass smeared with dust and the cityscape beyond a hazy smudge of gray.  The city, a monument to broken promises and shattered dreams.  He thought of the polls, the numbers echoing in the hollow chambers of his mind: seventy-five percent, eighty percent, a sea of dissent against the tide of folly.  Iraqis, Americans, the world itself, all chanting the same refrain: *It was a mistake.*  He remembered the troops, their faces grim, their words echoing his own: *A dumb idea, pull out now.*  He saw the faces of the dead, the ghosts of a war that never should have been fought.\n\nHe spoke of culture clashes, of the gulf between worlds, the arrogance of imposing an alien order.  He thought of Saddam, a monster, yes, but a monster whose removal had unleashed a new and deeper darkness.  He thought of the quicksand, the endless struggle, the futility of it all.  \n\nHis voice trailed off, a sigh lost in the silence.  He didn't have the answers.  He didn't know how to untangle this knot, this mess of blood and ashes.  But he knew one thing: staying wasn't the answer.  The Iraqi people, the ones they claimed to save, yearned for freedom, for an end to the occupation.  Their voices, though muted by fear, still cried out for peace.\n\nHe thought of the statistics, the eighty percent who wanted to be free.  *Maybe they knew better,* he thought, *maybe they knew the cost of our presence more than we ever could.* He saw the faces of the dead, the ghosts of a war that never should have been fought.",
            "The air hung thick with it, this ache of inequality.  Not just for the women, though they bore the brunt, it seemed.  It seeped into the marrow of any man who dared to stray from the path.  The glass ceiling, they called it, though the truth was, it was more like a shroud, a weight pressing down on aspirations.  You could see it, that place on the other side, the place where power resided, but never quite reach it.  The men who defied it, who dared to stay home with their children, they met with scorn, whispers of weakness clinging to them like smoke.  And the men who dared to find beauty in the needle and thread, in the silken whispers of fabric, they were met with doubt, their passion dismissed as frivolous, a divergence from the \"real\" man's course.\n\nThe world, it clung to its patterns, to the worn grooves of expectation.  But change, it crept like a slow river, carving its own path through the stone.  The women climbing the ladder, the men choosing family over paycheck, the artists finding their voice in the margins.  It was a hard fight, a slow burn, but the embers were glowing.  Change would come, it had to.  The question was, would it come soon enough?\n\nThe past, it was a ghost, a shadow stretching across the present, tainting the air.  But the future, that was a canvas, a blank slate waiting for the strokes of a new dawn.  And maybe, just maybe, those strokes would be bold, defiant, and free.",
            "The air hung thick and stagnant. The words stumbled out, halting, uncertain. \"Decriminalized,\" he said, tasting the word like ash. \"Not legalized. Knocked down from a crime, to... a ticket.\" He paused, searching for the right weight, the right shade of gray to paint the picture. \"Like forgetting something important, but the memory still aches.\"\n\nHe went on, voice a low rasp, \"Future ramifications. They linger. Like ghosts in the hollow places.\" He looked out, past the smoke-filled room, at the blank faces of the unseen interviewers.  \"The cost,\" he continued, \"of hauling them in, the courtrooms filled with the echoes of accusations, the endless paperwork. It bleeds the towns dry.\"\n\nHe saw their faces shift, a flicker of understanding, of shared cost. \"Denver,\" he said, the name a whisper of hope, \"they embraced it. Freed the money for schools, for the hungry, for the forgotten. The streets, they said, weren't paved with lies, just with the weight of forgotten dreams.\"\n\nHis voice dropped lower, \"But the open air, the smoke curling into the wind… it's a whisper, a shadow. It hangs there, a question mark. Not everyone welcomes it. Some fight it, still.\"\n\nHe spoke of the awkwardness, the discomfort, the lingering stigma. \"Like a stain on the soul,\" he murmured, \"a secret kept too long.\" He looked at them, eyes hard, \"But the truth is...it's a seed already sown. It grows in the silence, in the shadows. It waits for the right moment to bloom.\"\n\nHe paused, letting the silence hang heavy, \"They both have their price. Alcohol, a slow poison. Marijuana, a veil over the heart.\" He sighed, \"It's a dance with darkness, isn't it? Each step a choice, each consequence a lesson.\"",
            "The man spoke, his voice a rasp against the silence. \"Yes, I would say yes.\"  A pause, a drawl, the kind that stretched and thinned the air. \n\n\"Because...\" he began, then faltered.  \"These traditions, they're like roots sunk deep. They've held fast for a time, and that's something to reckon with. But the world, it shifts.  The wind changes course.  A tree needs to bend, or it breaks.\"\n\nHe paused, eyes distant, as if seeing something beyond the words.  \"They say there's a way, a right way.  Go to church every Sunday, kneel, pray, confess.  Believe as they say, live as they say. But what of the heart that bleeds a different truth? What of the soul that wanders in the shadows?\"\n\nHis voice dropped, a low murmur.  \"They judge, you see.  Don't take kindly to the different.  My father, he was an Episcopalian. My mother, Catholic.  They wouldn't let them wed.  Said it was against God's law.\"\n\nHe chuckled, a bitter sound. \"Love others, they preach.  Yet turn away those who aren't like them. A hollow echo, that.  Hypocrisy draped in holy robes.\"\n\n\"Devout, they are. Rigid.  Stuck in the ways.  Outdated, some might say.\"  A sigh, heavy and mournful.  \"They cling to the old stories, the old ways. But the world, it keeps moving.  And sometimes, the stories need to change.\"\n\nHe looked up, eyes searching, as if seeking answers in the empty space.\n\n\"No,\" he said finally.  \"They'd still find a way.\"\n\nHe shook his head, a slow, weary movement.  \"It's not the marriage that corrupts.  It's the darkness in the heart.  A shadow that darkens no matter the light.\"",
            "The matter weighs heavy. A knot in the gut. Right and wrong, blurred lines. This thing we wrestle with, the bleed of church and state, the definition of marriage, it cuts deep.  Like a bone saw splitting the marrow clean.  How do you speak of such things without waking the ghosts?  How do you thread the needle of tolerance without losing the thread altogether?\n\nMarriage, a sacrament, a covenant.  Some see it in the eyes of God. Others in the cold, hard steel of law.  Tax breaks, legal protections, the weight of the state upon the vows.  Baptism, a silent promise whispered in the dark.  But the state does not barge in on that, does it?  No, it leaves that to the unseen.\n\nSo what then? Civil union, a handshake, a contract. Two souls bound, two lives intertwined.  The government, a silent witness, a recorder. No need for judgment, just recognition.  Let them bind themselves, let them bear witness to each other's lives.  Let the church do its work in the shadows.\n\nThis is the crux, the heart of the quandary. A line drawn in the dust, shifting with every breath.  A nation divided, a nation searching. \n\nIf the states can find common ground, perhaps then the whole will follow.  But to amend the Constitution, to write darkness into the very fabric of the land, that is a dangerous game.  To ban a love, to etch it in stone, a stain on the soul of the nation. \n\nIt is a matter of weight, of consequence.  A matter that demands more than a careless brushstroke.  It demands a heart, a soul, a touch of grace.",
            "The boy's words hung in the air, a tremor in the silence. \"Homosexuality,\" he'd said, the word tasting strange, unfamiliar on his tongue. The man stared out at the dusty road stretching before them, the sun a bleached bone in the sky.  He knew the boy was looking at him, waiting for an answer, but the words felt like stones lodged in his throat.\n\nHe'd been raised in the church, bathed in the hymns and sermons of a God who seemed to offer only judgment and a narrow path. But the boy, innocent in his questions, had unearthed something deeper, something that had always lingered in the shadows. A question of freedom, of choice, a choice that seemed to cut against the grain of his upbringing.\n\nHe thought of his friends, the ones who lived lives different from his own, who loved beyond the lines drawn by the scriptures. He saw their faces, heard their laughter, felt the warmth of their acceptance. Could he deny their humanity, their right to love?\n\nThe answer came to him, slow and hard, like the grinding of rock against rock. It wasn't about agreement, not about condoning or condemning. It was about respect. About the right of each soul to find its own path, its own truth. It was about the freedom to choose, to love, to live.\n\n\"It's a matter for each state,\" he finally said, his voice rough with the unspoke words. \"Each place has its own way, its own story.\" \n\n\nHe looked at the boy, at the hope and confusion in his eyes. \"We can't force our beliefs on others,\" he said, \"but we can offer understanding. We can learn to live together, even when our paths diverge.\"",
            "The air hung thick and gray, the silence broken only by the rasp of his own breath. He stared at the screen, the words flickering like dying embers in the dim light. \"Myspace is a public thing,\" he mumbled, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. \"A bulletin board.\"  He paused, the knot in his chest tightening.  \"If you post something there, you have to know.\"  He swallowed hard, the taste of fear bitter on his tongue. \"People will see it.  School officials, anyone.\" \n\nHe remembered the old man's words, spoken in the twilight years, \"The world is a hard place, son.  The things you put into your head, they stay there. You forget what you want to remember, and you remember what you want to forget.\" He ran a calloused hand through his hair, the words echoing in the silence.  \n\n Was it wrong then, to protect the flock? To sift through the digital debris, searching for the whispers of danger before they turned into screams? Did they have a right, the guardians of the young, to peer into the corners of the internet, to see what lurked in the shadows?\n\nHe felt a cold hand grip his heart.  \"But what about privacy?\" he whispered, the question hanging heavy in the air.  The words seemed to dissolve into the dust motes dancing in the pale light.  \n\nHe thought of his own childhood, of the bare wood walls of his uncle's farmhouse, the smell of woodsmoke and damp earth, the endless silence broken only by the rustling leaves and the distant caw of a crow. He remembered the day he'd found his uncle's prized hunting rifle, hidden beneath the floorboards. The cold steel in his hand, the weight of it, the knowledge that it could take a life. \n\nHe'd kept that secret buried deep inside, a darkness he didn't dare share. But sometimes, in the dead of night, he'd wake up, the memory sharp and cold, the echo of the rifle's roar ringing in his ears.\n\nHe looked back at the screen. The words swam before his eyes, a blur of doubt and fear.  \"Maybe,\" he said finally, his voice a raspy whisper.  \"Maybe sometimes, the line between right and wrong is just a shadow.\"",
            "The war. A hot iron pressed to the gut. Nine Eleven. A wound raw and bleeding still. At first, the blood turned to rage.  It felt right, that fire. To go over there and lick the flames of their hate. But the fire choked, turned to ash. Now the bones of that rage ache.  We went in blind, fists clenched, hearts hammering. Like children with matches, not knowing the kindling would burn the whole damn forest. Didn't think of the smoke, the long aftermath, the way it would stain everything.\n\nThey fight themselves, those people. A sickness in their blood, a hunger that consumes. What good is our fire against such a thing? We went in to set them right, but the mirror showed back our own darkness.  \n\nThey’re not like us. Not human. Not anymore.  \n\nWe should have stayed home. Should have let the smoke rise and settle, let the dust fall like the slow decay of bone. But the fire took hold, and now it burns a hole in our souls. We went for revenge, they say. For justice. But all we found was more ashes."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, it needs changing. Her views, they're set in stone, some of them. Like a granite altar, unyielding. And folks, they're leaving. The flock is thinning. They say it's because the Church, she ain't accepting enough. Not of the times, not of the heart's desires.  She clings to these old ways, these pronouncements against what some call love, against choice, against the flesh.  \n\nThey talk about gay marriage, about abortion, about the use of birth control. These are matters of the soul, of the body, of the way the world unfolds. And the Church, she judges, she condemns.  But folks, they're tired of judgement. They want understanding, they want compassion. \n\nThink of it this way: A child comes to the well, thirsty. But the Church offers only dust.  They need a different kind of water, a deeper well.  They need a Church that reflects the world, not dictates it.\n\nThey say the Church’s stance on these things, it's driving people away. They feel the weight of her condemnation, the chill of her disapproval. And they wander, seeking solace elsewhere. \n\nA young man, he wants to love another man.  The Church says no. A woman, she wants control over her own body. The Church says no.  A couple, they need protection, they plan their children. The Church says no. And they turn away, seeking a haven of acceptance. \n\nThe Church, she's a grand edifice, built on the shoulders of centuries. But her foundation is cracking.  The wind howls through the cracks, carrying whispers of change.  And the people, they're listening. They're wondering, is there room for them, here?",
            "The boy sat there, silence a shroud around him.  He spoke, his voice thin as a whisper in the dry air.  \"Do you think it's right?\"  \n\nThe man squinted at the road, the gray dust motes dancing in the weak light. \"Right?\"  He turned the word over in his mouth, tasting its emptiness. \"What's right anymore, boy? In this world?\"\n\n\"Marriage,\" the boy said, his eyes fixed on the man's face. \"Two men. Or two women. Is that right?\"\n\nThe man looked at the boy, his silence a heavy thing.  He thought of the road stretching ahead, endless and unforgiving, of the ash-choked sky, of the silence that stretched deeper than any canyon.  He thought of the days gone by, of the things he'd seen, the things he'd done, the things he'd lost.  And in the face of all that, the boy's question felt small, insignificant, yet it held a weight that pressed down on him.\n\n\"The world,\" he said finally, his voice rasping, \"the world's gone mad.  It forgets what it used to know.  It forgets what it means to be human.\" He looked back at the boy, his gaze searching. \"But some things,\" he said, \"some things are as old as the hills.  Love.  Loss.  The need to be seen, to be heard.  Maybe,\" he added, his voice barely a whisper, \"maybe that's all that matters.\" \n\nHe didn't say if it was right or wrong.  He didn't have the answers.

            "The road stretched out before him, gray and cracked, a scar across the face of ash. The boy walked beside him, small and thin, his eyes fixed on the ground. They were headed south, driven by a hunger deeper than for food. A hunger for something whole, something salvaged from the wreckage.\n\n\"Why do they say it's wrong?\" the boy asked, his voice barely a whisper against the wind.\n\nThe man looked at him, the boy's face pale and etched with a weariness beyond his years.  \"They say things they don't understand,\" he rasped, his voice dry as dust. \"They fear what they don't know. They cling to shadows.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence between them thick with unspoken truths.  The sun, a pale disc in the smoky sky, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced around them.  They were on the move, always on the move, searching for something they couldn't name.\n\n\"But it's just love, isn't it?\" the boy persisted, his voice trembling. \n\nThe man stopped, pulling a battered photograph from his pocket. It was faded and worn, the edges softened with time. A younger version of himself stared back, a smile creased on his face. Beside him, a woman, her eyes bright with laughter.  The man's throat tightened, the memory a shard of glass in his chest.\n\n\"It's everything,\" he murmured, his voice rough with emotion. \"It's the only thing that matters.\"\n\nThey continued their journey, two solitary figures against the desolate landscape. The wind whispered through the skeletal trees, a mournful dirge for a world lost. They walked on, driven by the faint flicker of hope, the promise of something better, something truer, something worth fighting for.",

They say it rots the mind.\"\n\nThe man, his face worn and shadowed, looked down at him. \"They say a lot of things, boy.  Things that ain't always true.  Just because a thing is outlawed doesn't mean it's poison.  There's good in the world, and there's bad.  It's in the using, boy, not the thing itself.  You see the way they lock away the good things, the things that heal?  They fear what they don't understand.\"\n\nHe paused, his gaze drifting to a dusty vial on the shelf.  \"They lock away the things that ease the pain, the things that quiet the mind.  They keep them hidden, out of reach. But the boy, he saw the truth.  He saw the green leaves, the way they calmed the fevered brow, the way they lifted the weight of the world.  He saw the stories his grandfather told, the tales of ancient cures, of whispered remedies passed down through generations.\"\n\n\"There are things in this world,\" he said, his voice low, \"that the powerful want to keep from us.

            "The church, it’s changed. Not like it used to be. I remember Sundays, the little dresses, shoes to match, a purse too. All of it, every Sunday. Private school, friends there, all of us in our best clothes. Now it’s different. They got this thing, a teen mass. Thirty minutes tops. Folks come straight from the beach, clothes still damp, kids running in late. Even the morning services, the ones I used to dress up for, jeans and khakis are the norm. Khakis ain’t bad, I guess, but… casual. That’s the biggest thing, the casualness.\n\nAs for the rest, the politics of it all, that’s not my concern.\n\nThese things with the priests, the accusations.  It ain’t about marriage, not really. Men get married, they still… they still make those choices. It ain’t the church, it’s the man. Hell, there are other churches, ministers and the like, they get to marry, like on that show, “Seventh Heaven.” If a man wants that life, maybe he should look elsewhere.\n\nI think it’s in their blood, those urges.  Genetics, maybe. You can’t teach that, not really. You can try to hide it, try to bury it, but it’ll always come out. The church had no way of knowing, not in every case anyway. If they did know, and they covered it up, then shame on them. But I think sometimes, they were just blind.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of a lie. The words, they rasped in his throat like gravel. September eleventh, a date etched in ash and blood. A pretext, a twisted justification for a war born of shadows and ambition. They’d told the people of a phantom threat, of weapons of mass destruction, of a nexus with the unseen hand of Bin Laden. All of it a smoke screen.  \n\nThe old man, Powell, now spoke of doubt, of a gnawing uncertainty even as he’d thrust the evidence, or what passed for it, before the world. A betrayal, plain as day, a lie laid bare. Malfeasance, he spat. Impeachable, every goddamn fiber of his being screamed it. The Constitution, tattered and trampled beneath the boots of men drunk on power.\n\nThey’d come to office with war in their eyes, a thirst for vengeance inherited from the father’s legacy. Oil, a siren song whispering promises of wealth and dominance, fueled the fire. A blood vengeance, a scorched earth policy, all justified by a hollow echo of freedom.\n\nHe remembered the lake, the stillness of the water reflecting the twilight sky. A birch trunk, hauled from the depths, a testament to industry and need. The scent of damp wood and pine needles, the rhythmic slap of the oars against the water. A memory sharp against the backdrop of this festering wound.\n\nBut the Iraq war, it gnawed at him, a cancer eating away at the soul. A nation fractured, a people divided, a land consumed by the flames of a lie. The withdrawal, a perilous path, fraught with uncertainty. A fractured nation, teetering on the brink of chaos.\n\nThe UN, a shadow puppet show, strings pulled by unseen hands. A coalition of neighbors, a patchwork solution stitched together with wishful thinking. Sovereignty, a word whispered with fear and trembling. The parliament, a house of cards, collapsing under the weight of its own contradictions. A fractured parliament, a fractured nation, a fractured dream.  \n\nAnd he, a witness to it all, a silent observer to the unraveling. The dust settled, a shroud over a nation buried beneath the weight of its own shattered promises.",
            "The air hung thick and silent, a shroud of dust motes dancing in the wan light. He watched the boy, his brow creased in thought, his words tumbling out in a rush, half-formed, searching for purchase in the empty air.  \"It's pointless, this,\" the boy said, his voice a rasp in the stillness. \"Not a real war, not truly. Just… payback.\"\n\nHe knew the boy spoke of the burning, the smoke-filled skies that had marked their lives since they’d left the highway. The ghost of the towers, a wound etched deep in the national memory.  He nodded, a slow, weary movement, eyes fixed on the cracked asphalt before them. \n\n\"We're trying to build something,\" the boy continued, his voice gaining strength, \"a new world, a better world. But it's like trying to build a house on sand. It won't hold.\"\n\nHe looked away, towards the desolate landscape stretching before them, a canvas of bleached bone and ash. A world stripped bare, its veins of oil now a bitter monument to greed. \n\n\"Democracy,\" he muttered, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. \"A fragile thing, built on hope and fear. It takes root slowly, grows slowly, and can be crushed just as easily.\"\n\nThe boy's gaze fell on him, eyes wide and searching.  \"Are we doing the right thing?\" he asked, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nHe looked back at the boy, his face etched with the lines of a thousand unspoken truths. \"Sometimes,\" he said, his voice rough, \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the silence of things unspoken. A chill, deeper than the autumn wind, settled in the marrow. This talk, this push for a law, it felt wrong. Like a hand reaching in from the shadows to pull at the threads of something holy. The Constitution. It was there, plain as day, the separation. A line drawn in the dust, a boundary between the sacred and the secular. To meddle with this, to try and bend it, it was to invite the darkness in. \n\nThese men, these men with their righteous anger, they spoke of what churches believed, of their Bibles and their God. But they were but a single voice, a single choir in the vast cathedral of faith. To choose their song, their law, over the whispers of others, that was tyranny. A godless act, cloaked in the name of righteousness.\n\nAnd what of the amendment? To change the very fabric of the nation, to fold the church into the state, it was a betrayal of the very foundation upon which this country was built. It wasn't to protect the people, no. It was to bind them, to shackle them to the will of the few.\n\nThis was a matter for the cloisters, for the souls to wrestle with, not for the halls of power. Let them preach their damnation, let them live their lives according to their creed. The government had no place in this. \n\nThe whispers of history warned against this path, against this encroachment. The echoes of empires fallen, of freedoms lost, they rang in the silence. We were better than this. We could be better. \n\nLet the churches hold their councils, let the people pray. This was not a battle to be fought in the courts, in the legislatures, but in the quiet spaces of the heart, in the depths of the soul.",
            "The war in Iraq. A stain on the land, a festering wound. It began with lies, they said. Half-truths spun like gossamer threads, designed to catch the heart of a grieving nation. They said it was about those towers, those twisted metal skeletons reaching for a sky choked with ash. But the truth, it simmered below, a slow burn of greed and an echo of ancient battles fought on this sun-baked soil.\n\nI reckon I've never been one for war. Not a man for violence, not a man for the spilling of blood. The taking of life, it leaves a chill that never truly fades. This war, it felt like a fever dream, a bad dream the world couldn't wake from.  A echo of Vietnam, they called it. A slow, grinding machine that chewed up young men and spat them out, broken and empty.\n\nThey say they were going to bring democracy, a balm for a land torn by strife. But what they found was not the welcoming embrace of freedom, but a tangled web of hatred and resentment. They toppled a tyrant, yes, but in his place, a vacuum. A void filled not with hope, but with the ghosts of whispers, the cries of the dispossessed.\n\nThey tried to impose their will on a land with a history older than time itself. They forgot that change, real change, cannot be forced. It must be coaxed, nurtured, like a fragile seedling in the desert. They came with guns and bombs, and they found only fire.\n\nThey said they had to fight for freedom, for the American way of life. But what they saw in those eyes, those weary, haunted eyes, was not freedom. They saw fear, they saw anger, they saw a reflection of their own humanity warped by the smoke and the blood.\n\nNow, years later, the dust still hasn't settled. The scars remain, etched deep into the fabric of that land, a testament to the folly of men who thought they could remake the world in their own image.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of rain and ash. A silence pressed down, heavy as the dust that coated everything.  He spoke, voice rasping like a dry wind through skeletal trees: \"It's a right,\" he said, the word hanging in the air. \"A right like breathing, like the sun.\" He paused, his eyes fixed on some distant horizon only he could see. \"It's in the blood, in the bones.  Not some choice you make.\"\n\nHe knew the world saw it different.  The world saw a battle, a fight.  But for him, it was simpler.  He'd seen love in the eyes of those two men down the street, in the way they held hands, in the quiet comfort of their shared life. It was the same love he'd seen in his own mother's eyes before she died.  The same love that bound him to the boy beside him now. \n\n\"They try to tell us it's wrong,\" he continued, his voice low. \"Try to say it's unnatural. But the Lord, He made the world. He made all things. And He made love, didn't He?  This ain't no sin. This is just life.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy, his young face filled with a wisdom beyond his years.  \"They try to play God,\" he whispered, his gaze hardening. \"But God ain't about taking away. He's about giving. About love.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy again, a fierce protectiveness rising in his chest. \"And we'll keep giving it,\" he said. \"We'll keep loving. We'll keep fighting for what's right. 'Cause in the end, that's all that matters.\"",
            "The boy’s words hung in the air, a dry rustle of leaves in the wind.  \"When you put something on the internet,” he said, his voice thin as a breaking twig, “it’s… public.”  He paused, searching for the right word. “It’s completely public.”  \n\nThe man watched him, a slow smoke curling from his lips, the light of the dying fire casting his face in shadow. “You can’t,” he said, his voice a low rumble, “unspeak what’s been spoken.”\n\nThe boy’s eyes, wide and shadowed, looked up at him. “I mean, as an R.A., I’ve seen it. You put something out there, it colors people’s thoughts. If you’re talkin’ ‘bout blowin' things up, or shootings…” He trailed off, the fear in his voice palpable.\n\n“Someone’s gonna say somethin’. You can’t put that out there. The internet,” he spat the word out like a curse, “it’s seen by everyone. If you’re friends with someone on Myspace, you get their bulletin. The school didn’t get it from the school. Someone went to the school. They had to act.” He gestured with his hand, a hollow, empty movement.\n\n“They can’t let it sit, God forbid somethin’ happens, they coulda prevented it.”\n\nThe boy nodded, his face pale in the flickering light. “But,” he said, his voice barely a whisper, “you don’t know what to take seriously. Some folks just fool around like that. It could be…” He searched for the words, his brow furrowed. “It could be like that time at school. An experiment gone wrong.”\n\nThe man sighed, the smoke curling upwards. “For a sociology class, or somethin’.”\n\n“And it could also be something real serious,” the boy continued, his voice gaining a sliver of strength. “The thing is, what happened here, someone overheard somethin’ and told the school. Then they checked his Facebook, his friend did, and they saw things, things that might have been a joke, but in light of what happened, became real serious.” \n\nHe looked up at the man, his eyes pleading. “When you put stuff out there, on the internet, there ain’t no privacy. If you don’t want it out there, don’t put it there. If you don’t want people to see it, to think somethin’ of you, you can’t tell them what to think.” He paused, his voice weary. “You can’t tell people what to take seriously or not.”\n\nThe man smoked in silence for a long moment, his gaze fixed on the dying embers.",
            "The war. Drawn out. Too long. Like a fevered dream that won't break.  It began with good intentions, maybe. To right a wrong, to bring light to a darkened place. Democracy, they called it. A fair hand for the people. But the light, it seemed to flicker.  Lost in the smoke and dust.\n\nNow, it feels like something else. A need to prove. To show who's strong. A shadow of old scores settled in the ashes.  The father's whisper, a grudge carried on the wind.\n\nDemocracy, a faded banner.  A justification worn thin. We struck a blow, a quick spark of fire. But the flames, they didn't die.  They smoldered. They crept. The years stretched on, a long, lean shadow. \n\nThe cost, it mounts. Dollars bled into the earth, a river of red.  Our own wounds fester, ignored. Poverty, a hungry beast, gnaws at the edges of our nation. It cries out, but the drums of war drown out its voice.\n\nHow long can we keep this up?  How many sons and daughters must be lost before the echoes of purpose fade away?  They say there must be a victory. A clean break. But what victory is there in a land turned to ash?\n\nThe time has come for us to look back.  To see the faces of the lost, the tears of the weeping mothers. To hear the whisper of the wind through the empty husks of buildings.  It's time to walk away. To heal the wounds, both our own and theirs.  The war has served its purpose. It's time to let it die.",
            "The day bled into the next, the rain a shroud over the world.  He sat across the table from the boy, the cracked plastic surface slick with condensation. The boy shifted, fiddling with the frayed edge of his worn sweater. The silence stretched, thick and heavy as the air. Finally, the boy spoke, his voice a whisper against the hum of the dying storm. \"Can I ask you something?\" \n\nHe looked at the boy, his face drawn and weary. \"Sure, son. What is it?\"\n\n\"About that, uh, about what happened.\" \n\nHe reached out, his hand resting on the boy's shoulder, a gesture both comforting and sorrowful. \"What about it?\" \n\nThe boy hesitated, his eyes downcast. \"Is it, is it bad that someone found out?\"\n\nHe sighed, the sound rasping in his chest. \"Bad?  It depends. What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Like, on Myspace. If someone sees something, can they, can they stop it?\"\n\n\"Stop what?\" \n\n\"You know,\" the boy mumbled, his gaze fixed on the damp table. \"If someone's gonna do something bad, if they say it online.\"\n\nHe reached for the cup of lukewarm coffee, the metal bitter against his tongue. \"The world is full of shadows, son.  Things whispered in the dark. Sometimes those whispers are heard. Sometimes they're not.\"\n\nThe boy looked up, his eyes wide and searching. \"But if someone hears them, can they stop it? Can they make it go away?\"\n\n\"That depends,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly. \"Depends on if they have the will.  Depends if they're willing to face the darkness.\"\n\nThe boy fell silent, the weight of his question hanging in the air.  The rain continued its relentless drumming, a mournful counterpoint to their unspoken conversation.  He knew the boy was too young to understand the complexities of the world. The shadows that lurked beneath the surface, the unspoken truths that festered in the human heart.  But he also knew that the boy was more perceptive than he let on, his young mind already grappling with questions that would haunt him for years to come.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the words catching in his throat like ash.  He shifted, the plastic of the chair scraping against the worn linoleum.  *Hypocritical*, he thought, the word a bitter taste on his tongue.  \"Hate to be part of the chorus,\" he mumbled, \"the ones who just say 'I told you so.'\"  He knew the feeling, the punch of certainty that came with hindsight, the ease of joining the throng.  But it wasn't about that now.\n\nHe looked out the window, the glass smeared with dust and the cityscape beyond a hazy smudge of gray.  The city, a monument to broken promises and shattered dreams.  He thought of the polls, the numbers echoing in the hollow chambers of his mind: seventy-five percent, eighty percent, a sea of dissent against the tide of folly.  Iraqis, Americans, the world itself, all chanting the same refrain: *It was a mistake.*  He remembered the troops, their faces grim, their words echoing his own: *A dumb idea, pull out now.*  He saw the faces of the dead, the ghosts of a war that never should have been fought.\n\nHe spoke of culture clashes, of the gulf between worlds, the arrogance of imposing an alien order.  He thought of Saddam, a monster, yes, but a monster whose removal had unleashed a new and deeper darkness.  He thought of the quicksand, the endless struggle, the futility of it all.  \n\nHis voice trailed off, a sigh lost in the silence.  He didn't have the answers.  He didn't know how to untangle this knot, this mess of blood and ashes.  But he knew one thing: staying wasn't the answer.  The Iraqi people, the ones they claimed to save, yearned for freedom, for an end to the occupation.  Their voices, though muted by fear, still cried out for peace.\n\nHe thought of the statistics, the eighty percent who wanted to be free.  *Maybe they knew better,* he thought, *maybe they knew the cost of our presence more than we ever could.* He saw the faces of the dead, the ghosts of a war that never should have been fought.",
            "The air hung thick with it, this ache of inequality.  Not just for the women, though they bore the brunt, it seemed.  It seeped into the marrow of any man who dared to stray from the path.  The glass ceiling, they called it, though the truth was, it was more like a shroud, a weight pressing down on aspirations.  You could see it, that place on the other side, the place where power resided, but never quite reach it.  The men who defied it, who dared to stay home with their children, they met with scorn, whispers of weakness clinging to them like smoke.  And the men who dared to find beauty in the needle and thread, in the silken whispers of fabric, they were met with doubt, their passion dismissed as frivolous, a divergence from the \"real\" man's course.\n\nThe world, it clung to its patterns, to the worn grooves of expectation.  But change, it crept like a slow river, carving its own path through the stone.  The women climbing the ladder, the men choosing family over paycheck, the artists finding their voice in the margins.  It was a hard fight, a slow burn, but the embers were glowing.  Change would come, it had to.  The question was, would it come soon enough?\n\nThe past, it was a ghost, a shadow stretching across the present, tainting the air.  But the future, that was a canvas, a blank slate waiting for the strokes of a new dawn.  And maybe, just maybe, those strokes would be bold, defiant, and free.",
            "The air hung thick and stagnant. The words stumbled out, halting, uncertain. \"Decriminalized,\" he said, tasting the word like ash. \"Not legalized. Knocked down from a crime, to... a ticket.\" He paused, searching for the right weight, the right shade of gray to paint the picture. \"Like forgetting something important, but the memory still aches.\"\n\nHe went on, voice a low rasp, \"Future ramifications. They linger. Like ghosts in the hollow places.\" He looked out, past the smoke-filled room, at the blank faces of the unseen interviewers.  \"The cost,\" he continued, \"of hauling them in, the courtrooms filled with the echoes of accusations, the endless paperwork. It bleeds the towns dry.\"\n\nHe saw their faces shift, a flicker of understanding, of shared cost. \"Denver,\" he said, the name a whisper of hope, \"they embraced it. Freed the money for schools, for the hungry, for the forgotten. The streets, they said, weren't paved with lies, just with the weight of forgotten dreams.\"\n\nHis voice dropped lower, \"But the open air, the smoke curling into the wind… it's a whisper, a shadow. It hangs there, a question mark. Not everyone welcomes it. Some fight it, still.\"\n\nHe spoke of the awkwardness, the discomfort, the lingering stigma. \"Like a stain on the soul,\" he murmured, \"a secret kept too long.\" He looked at them, eyes hard, \"But the truth is...it's a seed already sown. It grows in the silence, in the shadows. It waits for the right moment to bloom.\"\n\nHe paused, letting the silence hang heavy, \"They both have their price. Alcohol, a slow poison. Marijuana, a veil over the heart.\" He sighed, \"It's a dance with darkness, isn't it? Each step a choice, each consequence a lesson.\"",
            "The man spoke, his voice a rasp against the silence. \"Yes, I would say yes.\"  A pause, a drawl, the kind that stretched and thinned the air. \n\n\"Because...\" he began, then faltered.  \"These traditions, they're like roots sunk deep. They've held fast for a time, and that's something to reckon with. But the world, it shifts.  The wind changes course.  A tree needs to bend, or it breaks.\"\n\nHe paused, eyes distant, as if seeing something beyond the words.  \"They say there's a way, a right way.  Go to church every Sunday, kneel, pray, confess.  Believe as they say, live as they say. But what of the heart that bleeds a different truth? What of the soul that wanders in the shadows?\"\n\nHis voice dropped, a low murmur.  \"They judge, you see.  Don't take kindly to the different.  My father, he was an Episcopalian. My mother, Catholic.  They wouldn't let them wed.  Said it was against God's law.\"\n\nHe chuckled, a bitter sound. \"Love others, they preach.  Yet turn away those who aren't like them. A hollow echo, that.  Hypocrisy draped in holy robes.\"\n\n\"Devout, they are. Rigid.  Stuck in the ways.  Outdated, some might say.\"  A sigh, heavy and mournful.  \"They cling to the old stories, the old ways. But the world, it keeps moving.  And sometimes, the stories need to change.\"\n\nHe looked up, eyes searching, as if seeking answers in the empty space.\n\n\"No,\" he said finally.  \"They'd still find a way.\"\n\nHe shook his head, a slow, weary movement.  \"It's not the marriage that corrupts.  It's the darkness in the heart.  A shadow that darkens no matter the light.\"",
            "The matter weighs heavy. A knot in the gut. Right and wrong, blurred lines. This thing we wrestle with, the bleed of church and state, the definition of marriage, it cuts deep.  Like a bone saw splitting the marrow clean.  How do you speak of such things without waking the ghosts?  How do you thread the needle of tolerance without losing the thread altogether?\n\nMarriage, a sacrament, a covenant.  Some see it in the eyes of God. Others in the cold, hard steel of law.  Tax breaks, legal protections, the weight of the state upon the vows.  Baptism, a silent promise whispered in the dark.  But the state does not barge in on that, does it?  No, it leaves that to the unseen.\n\nSo what then? Civil union, a handshake, a contract. Two souls bound, two lives intertwined.  The government, a silent witness, a recorder. No need for judgment, just recognition.  Let them bind themselves, let them bear witness to each other's lives.  Let the church do its work in the shadows.\n\nThis is the crux, the heart of the quandary. A line drawn in the dust, shifting with every breath.  A nation divided, a nation searching. \n\nIf the states can find common ground, perhaps then the whole will follow.  But to amend the Constitution, to write darkness into the very fabric of the land, that is a dangerous game.  To ban a love, to etch it in stone, a stain on the soul of the nation. \n\nIt is a matter of weight, of consequence.  A matter that demands more than a careless brushstroke.  It demands a heart, a soul, a touch of grace.",
            "The boy's words hung in the air, a tremor in the silence. \"Homosexuality,\" he'd said, the word tasting strange, unfamiliar on his tongue. The man stared out at the dusty road stretching before them, the sun a bleached bone in the sky.  He knew the boy was looking at him, waiting for an answer, but the words felt like stones lodged in his throat.\n\nHe'd been raised in the church, bathed in the hymns and sermons of a God who seemed to offer only judgment and a narrow path. But the boy, innocent in his questions, had unearthed something deeper, something that had always lingered in the shadows. A question of freedom, of choice, a choice that seemed to cut against the grain of his upbringing.\n\nHe thought of his friends, the ones who lived lives different from his own, who loved beyond the lines drawn by the scriptures. He saw their faces, heard their laughter, felt the warmth of their acceptance. Could he deny their humanity, their right to love?\n\nThe answer came to him, slow and hard, like the grinding of rock against rock. It wasn't about agreement, not about condoning or condemning. It was about respect. About the right of each soul to find its own path, its own truth. It was about the freedom to choose, to love, to live.\n\n\"It's a matter for each state,\" he finally said, his voice rough with the unspoke words. \"Each place has its own way, its own story.\" \n\n\nHe looked at the boy, at the hope and confusion in his eyes. \"We can't force our beliefs on others,\" he said, \"but we can offer understanding. We can learn to live together, even when our paths diverge.\"",
            "The air hung thick and gray, the silence broken only by the rasp of his own breath. He stared at the screen, the words flickering like dying embers in the dim light. \"Myspace is a public thing,\" he mumbled, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. \"A bulletin board.\"  He paused, the knot in his chest tightening.  \"If you post something there, you have to know.\"  He swallowed hard, the taste of fear bitter on his tongue. \"People will see it.  School officials, anyone.\" \n\nHe remembered the old man's words, spoken in the twilight years, \"The world is a hard place, son.  The things you put into your head, they stay there. You forget what you want to remember, and you remember what you want to forget.\" He ran a calloused hand through his hair, the words echoing in the silence.  \n\n Was it wrong then, to protect the flock? To sift through the digital debris, searching for the whispers of danger before they turned into screams? Did they have a right, the guardians of the young, to peer into the corners of the internet, to see what lurked in the shadows?\n\nHe felt a cold hand grip his heart.  \"But what about privacy?\" he whispered, the question hanging heavy in the air.  The words seemed to dissolve into the dust motes dancing in the pale light.  \n\nHe thought of his own childhood, of the bare wood walls of his uncle's farmhouse, the smell of woodsmoke and damp earth, the endless silence broken only by the rustling leaves and the distant caw of a crow. He remembered the day he'd found his uncle's prized hunting rifle, hidden beneath the floorboards. The cold steel in his hand, the weight of it, the knowledge that it could take a life. \n\nHe'd kept that secret buried deep inside, a darkness he didn't dare share. But sometimes, in the dead of night, he'd wake up, the memory sharp and cold, the echo of the rifle's roar ringing in his ears.\n\nHe looked back at the screen. The words swam before his eyes, a blur of doubt and fear.  \"Maybe,\" he said finally, his voice a raspy whisper.  \"Maybe sometimes, the line between right and wrong is just a shadow.\"",
            "The war. A hot iron pressed to the gut. Nine Eleven. A wound raw and bleeding still. At first, the blood turned to rage.  It felt right, that fire. To go over there and lick the flames of their hate. But the fire choked, turned to ash. Now the bones of that rage ache.  We went in blind, fists clenched, hearts hammering. Like children with matches, not knowing the kindling would burn the whole damn forest. Didn't think of the smoke, the long aftermath, the way it would stain everything.\n\nThey fight themselves, those people. A sickness in their blood, a hunger that consumes. What good is our fire against such a thing? We went in to set them right, but the mirror showed back our own darkness.  \n\nThey’re not like us. Not human. Not anymore.  \n\nWe should have stayed home. Should have let the smoke rise and settle, let the dust fall like the slow decay of bone. But the fire took hold, and now it burns a hole in our souls. We went for revenge, they say. For justice. But all we found was more ashes."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, it needs changing. Her views, they're set in stone, some of them. Like a granite altar, unyielding. And folks, they're leaving. The flock is thinning. They say it's because the Church, she ain't accepting enough. Not of the times, not of the heart's desires.  She clings to these old ways, these pronouncements against what some call love, against choice, against the flesh.  \n\nThey talk about gay marriage, about abortion, about the use of birth control. These are matters of the soul, of the body, of the way the world unfolds. And the Church, she judges, she condemns.  But folks, they're tired of judgement. They want understanding, they want compassion. \n\nThink of it this way: A child comes to the well, thirsty. But the Church offers only dust.  They need a different kind of water, a deeper well.  They need a Church that reflects the world, not dictates it.\n\nThey say the Church’s stance on these things, it's driving people away. They feel the weight of her condemnation, the chill of her disapproval. And they wander, seeking solace elsewhere. \n\nA young man, he wants to love another man.  The Church says no. A woman, she wants control over her own body. The Church says no.  A couple, they need protection, they plan their children. The Church says no. And they turn away, seeking a haven of acceptance. \n\nThe Church, she's a grand edifice, built on the shoulders of centuries. But her foundation is cracking.  The wind howls through the cracks, carrying whispers of change.  And the people, they're listening. They're wondering, is there room for them, here?",
            "The boy sat there, silence a shroud around him.  He spoke, his voice thin as a whisper in the dry air.  \"Do you think it's right?\"  \n\nThe man squinted at the road, the gray dust motes dancing in the weak light. \"Right?\"  He turned the word over in his mouth, tasting its emptiness. \"What's right anymore, boy? In this world?\"\n\n\"Marriage,\" the boy said, his eyes fixed on the man's face. \"Two men. Or two women. Is that right?\"\n\nThe man looked at the boy, his silence a heavy thing.  He thought of the road stretching ahead, endless and unforgiving, of the ash-choked sky, of the silence that stretched deeper than any canyon.  He thought of the days gone by, of the things he'd seen, the things he'd done, the things he'd lost.  And in the face of all that, the boy's question felt small, insignificant, yet it held a weight that pressed down on him.\n\n\"The world,\" he said finally, his voice rasping, \"the world's gone mad.  It forgets what it used to know.  It forgets what it means to be human.\" He looked back at the boy, his gaze searching. \"But some things,\" he said, \"some things are as old as the hills.  Love.  Loss.  The need to be seen, to be heard.  Maybe,\" he added, his voice barely a whisper, \"maybe that's all that matters.\" \n\nHe didn't say if it was right or wrong.  He didn't have the answers.

            "The road stretched out before him, gray and cracked, a scar across the face of ash. The boy walked beside him, small and thin, his eyes fixed on the ground. They were headed south, driven by a hunger deeper than for food. A hunger for something whole, something salvaged from the wreckage.\n\n\"Why do they say it's wrong?\" the boy asked, his voice barely a whisper against the wind.\n\nThe man looked at him, the boy's face pale and etched with a weariness beyond his years.  \"They say things they don't understand,\" he rasped, his voice dry as dust. \"They fear what they don't know. They cling to shadows.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence between them thick with unspoken truths.  The sun, a pale disc in the smoky sky, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced around them.  They were on the move, always on the move, searching for something they couldn't name.\n\n\"But it's just love, isn't it?\" the boy persisted, his voice trembling. \n\nThe man stopped, pulling a battered photograph from his pocket. It was faded and worn, the edges softened with time. A younger version of himself stared back, a smile creased on his face. Beside him, a woman, her eyes bright with laughter.  The man's throat tightened, the memory a shard of glass in his chest.\n\n\"It's everything,\" he murmured, his voice rough with emotion. \"It's the only thing that matters.\"\n\nThey continued their journey, two solitary figures against the desolate landscape. The wind whispered through the skeletal trees, a mournful dirge for a world lost. They walked on, driven by the faint flicker of hope, the promise of something better, something truer, something worth fighting for.",

They say it rots the mind.\"\n\nThe man, his face worn and shadowed, looked down at him. \"They say a lot of things, boy.  Things that ain't always true.  Just because a thing is outlawed doesn't mean it's poison.  There's good in the world, and there's bad.  It's in the using, boy, not the thing itself.  You see the way they lock away the good things, the things that heal?  They fear what they don't understand.\"\n\nHe paused, his gaze drifting to a dusty vial on the shelf.  \"They lock away the things that ease the pain, the things that quiet the mind.  They keep them hidden, out of reach. But the boy, he saw the truth.  He saw the green leaves, the way they calmed the fevered brow, the way they lifted the weight of the world.  He saw the stories his grandfather told, the tales of ancient cures, of whispered remedies passed down through generations.\"\n\n\"There are things in this world,\" he said, his voice low, \"that the powerful want to keep from us.

            "The church, it’s changed. Not like it used to be. I remember Sundays, the little dresses, shoes to match, a purse too. All of it, every Sunday. Private school, friends there, all of us in our best clothes. Now it’s different. They got this thing, a teen mass. Thirty minutes tops. Folks come straight from the beach, clothes still damp, kids running in late. Even the morning services, the ones I used to dress up for, jeans and khakis are the norm. Khakis ain’t bad, I guess, but… casual. That’s the biggest thing, the casualness.\n\nAs for the rest, the politics of it all, that’s not my concern.\n\nThese things with the priests, the accusations.  It ain’t about marriage, not really. Men get married, they still… they still make those choices. It ain’t the church, it’s the man. Hell, there are other churches, ministers and the like, they get to marry, like on that show, “Seventh Heaven.” If a man wants that life, maybe he should look elsewhere.\n\nI think it’s in their blood, those urges.  Genetics, maybe. You can’t teach that, not really. You can try to hide it, try to bury it, but it’ll always come out. The church had no way of knowing, not in every case anyway. If they did know, and they covered it up, then shame on them. But I think sometimes, they were just blind.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of a lie. The words, they rasped in his throat like gravel. September eleventh, a date etched in ash and blood. A pretext, a twisted justification for a war born of shadows and ambition. They’d told the people of a phantom threat, of weapons of mass destruction, of a nexus with the unseen hand of Bin Laden. All of it a smoke screen.  \n\nThe old man, Powell, now spoke of doubt, of a gnawing uncertainty even as he’d thrust the evidence, or what passed for it, before the world. A betrayal, plain as day, a lie laid bare. Malfeasance, he spat. Impeachable, every goddamn fiber of his being screamed it. The Constitution, tattered and trampled beneath the boots of men drunk on power.\n\nThey’d come to office with war in their eyes, a thirst for vengeance inherited from the father’s legacy. Oil, a siren song whispering promises of wealth and dominance, fueled the fire. A blood vengeance, a scorched earth policy, all justified by a hollow echo of freedom.\n\nHe remembered the lake, the stillness of the water reflecting the twilight sky. A birch trunk, hauled from the depths, a testament to industry and need. The scent of damp wood and pine needles, the rhythmic slap of the oars against the water. A memory sharp against the backdrop of this festering wound.\n\nBut the Iraq war, it gnawed at him, a cancer eating away at the soul. A nation fractured, a people divided, a land consumed by the flames of a lie. The withdrawal, a perilous path, fraught with uncertainty. A fractured nation, teetering on the brink of chaos.\n\nThe UN, a shadow puppet show, strings pulled by unseen hands. A coalition of neighbors, a patchwork solution stitched together with wishful thinking. Sovereignty, a word whispered with fear and trembling. The parliament, a house of cards, collapsing under the weight of its own contradictions. A fractured parliament, a fractured nation, a fractured dream.  \n\nAnd he, a witness to it all, a silent observer to the unraveling. The dust settled, a shroud over a nation buried beneath the weight of its own shattered promises.",
            "The air hung thick and silent, a shroud of dust motes dancing in the wan light. He watched the boy, his brow creased in thought, his words tumbling out in a rush, half-formed, searching for purchase in the empty air.  \"It's pointless, this,\" the boy said, his voice a rasp in the stillness. \"Not a real war, not truly. Just… payback.\"\n\nHe knew the boy spoke of the burning, the smoke-filled skies that had marked their lives since they’d left the highway. The ghost of the towers, a wound etched deep in the national memory.  He nodded, a slow, weary movement, eyes fixed on the cracked asphalt before them. \n\n\"We're trying to build something,\" the boy continued, his voice gaining strength, \"a new world, a better world. But it's like trying to build a house on sand. It won't hold.\"\n\nHe looked away, towards the desolate landscape stretching before them, a canvas of bleached bone and ash. A world stripped bare, its veins of oil now a bitter monument to greed. \n\n\"Democracy,\" he muttered, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. \"A fragile thing, built on hope and fear. It takes root slowly, grows slowly, and can be crushed just as easily.\"\n\nThe boy's gaze fell on him, eyes wide and searching.  \"Are we doing the right thing?\" he asked, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nHe looked back at the boy, his face etched with the lines of a thousand unspoken truths. \"Sometimes,\" he said, his voice rough, \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the silence of things unspoken. A chill, deeper than the autumn wind, settled in the marrow. This talk, this push for a law, it felt wrong. Like a hand reaching in from the shadows to pull at the threads of something holy. The Constitution. It was there, plain as day, the separation. A line drawn in the dust, a boundary between the sacred and the secular. To meddle with this, to try and bend it, it was to invite the darkness in. \n\nThese men, these men with their righteous anger, they spoke of what churches believed, of their Bibles and their God. But they were but a single voice, a single choir in the vast cathedral of faith. To choose their song, their law, over the whispers of others, that was tyranny. A godless act, cloaked in the name of righteousness.\n\nAnd what of the amendment? To change the very fabric of the nation, to fold the church into the state, it was a betrayal of the very foundation upon which this country was built. It wasn't to protect the people, no. It was to bind them, to shackle them to the will of the few.\n\nThis was a matter for the cloisters, for the souls to wrestle with, not for the halls of power. Let them preach their damnation, let them live their lives according to their creed. The government had no place in this. \n\nThe whispers of history warned against this path, against this encroachment. The echoes of empires fallen, of freedoms lost, they rang in the silence. We were better than this. We could be better. \n\nLet the churches hold their councils, let the people pray. This was not a battle to be fought in the courts, in the legislatures, but in the quiet spaces of the heart, in the depths of the soul.",
            "The war in Iraq. A stain on the land, a festering wound. It began with lies, they said. Half-truths spun like gossamer threads, designed to catch the heart of a grieving nation. They said it was about those towers, those twisted metal skeletons reaching for a sky choked with ash. But the truth, it simmered below, a slow burn of greed and an echo of ancient battles fought on this sun-baked soil.\n\nI reckon I've never been one for war. Not a man for violence, not a man for the spilling of blood. The taking of life, it leaves a chill that never truly fades. This war, it felt like a fever dream, a bad dream the world couldn't wake from.  A echo of Vietnam, they called it. A slow, grinding machine that chewed up young men and spat them out, broken and empty.\n\nThey say they were going to bring democracy, a balm for a land torn by strife. But what they found was not the welcoming embrace of freedom, but a tangled web of hatred and resentment. They toppled a tyrant, yes, but in his place, a vacuum. A void filled not with hope, but with the ghosts of whispers, the cries of the dispossessed.\n\nThey tried to impose their will on a land with a history older than time itself. They forgot that change, real change, cannot be forced. It must be coaxed, nurtured, like a fragile seedling in the desert. They came with guns and bombs, and they found only fire.\n\nThey said they had to fight for freedom, for the American way of life. But what they saw in those eyes, those weary, haunted eyes, was not freedom. They saw fear, they saw anger, they saw a reflection of their own humanity warped by the smoke and the blood.\n\nNow, years later, the dust still hasn't settled. The scars remain, etched deep into the fabric of that land, a testament to the folly of men who thought they could remake the world in their own image.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of rain and ash. A silence pressed down, heavy as the dust that coated everything.  He spoke, voice rasping like a dry wind through skeletal trees: \"It's a right,\" he said, the word hanging in the air. \"A right like breathing, like the sun.\" He paused, his eyes fixed on some distant horizon only he could see. \"It's in the blood, in the bones.  Not some choice you make.\"\n\nHe knew the world saw it different.  The world saw a battle, a fight.  But for him, it was simpler.  He'd seen love in the eyes of those two men down the street, in the way they held hands, in the quiet comfort of their shared life. It was the same love he'd seen in his own mother's eyes before she died.  The same love that bound him to the boy beside him now. \n\n\"They try to tell us it's wrong,\" he continued, his voice low. \"Try to say it's unnatural. But the Lord, He made the world. He made all things. And He made love, didn't He?  This ain't no sin. This is just life.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy, his young face filled with a wisdom beyond his years.  \"They try to play God,\" he whispered, his gaze hardening. \"But God ain't about taking away. He's about giving. About love.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy again, a fierce protectiveness rising in his chest. \"And we'll keep giving it,\" he said. \"We'll keep loving. We'll keep fighting for what's right. 'Cause in the end, that's all that matters.\"",
            "The boy’s words hung in the air, a dry rustle of leaves in the wind.  \"When you put something on the internet,” he said, his voice thin as a breaking twig, “it’s… public.”  He paused, searching for the right word. “It’s completely public.”  \n\nThe man watched him, a slow smoke curling from his lips, the light of the dying fire casting his face in shadow. “You can’t,” he said, his voice a low rumble, “unspeak what’s been spoken.”\n\nThe boy’s eyes, wide and shadowed, looked up at him. “I mean, as an R.A., I’ve seen it. You put something out there, it colors people’s thoughts. If you’re talkin’ ‘bout blowin' things up, or shootings…” He trailed off, the fear in his voice palpable.\n\n“Someone’s gonna say somethin’. You can’t put that out there. The internet,” he spat the word out like a curse, “it’s seen by everyone. If you’re friends with someone on Myspace, you get their bulletin. The school didn’t get it from the school. Someone went to the school. They had to act.” He gestured with his hand, a hollow, empty movement.\n\n“They can’t let it sit, God forbid somethin’ happens, they coulda prevented it.”\n\nThe boy nodded, his face pale in the flickering light. “But,” he said, his voice barely a whisper, “you don’t know what to take seriously. Some folks just fool around like that. It could be…” He searched for the words, his brow furrowed. “It could be like that time at school. An experiment gone wrong.”\n\nThe man sighed, the smoke curling upwards. “For a sociology class, or somethin’.”\n\n“And it could also be something real serious,” the boy continued, his voice gaining a sliver of strength. “The thing is, what happened here, someone overheard somethin’ and told the school. Then they checked his Facebook, his friend did, and they saw things, things that might have been a joke, but in light of what happened, became real serious.” \n\nHe looked up at the man, his eyes pleading. “When you put stuff out there, on the internet, there ain’t no privacy. If you don’t want it out there, don’t put it there. If you don’t want people to see it, to think somethin’ of you, you can’t tell them what to think.” He paused, his voice weary. “You can’t tell people what to take seriously or not.”\n\nThe man smoked in silence for a long moment, his gaze fixed on the dying embers.",
            "The war. Drawn out. Too long. Like a fevered dream that won't break.  It began with good intentions, maybe. To right a wrong, to bring light to a darkened place. Democracy, they called it. A fair hand for the people. But the light, it seemed to flicker.  Lost in the smoke and dust.\n\nNow, it feels like something else. A need to prove. To show who's strong. A shadow of old scores settled in the ashes.  The father's whisper, a grudge carried on the wind.\n\nDemocracy, a faded banner.  A justification worn thin. We struck a blow, a quick spark of fire. But the flames, they didn't die.  They smoldered. They crept. The years stretched on, a long, lean shadow. \n\nThe cost, it mounts. Dollars bled into the earth, a river of red.  Our own wounds fester, ignored. Poverty, a hungry beast, gnaws at the edges of our nation. It cries out, but the drums of war drown out its voice.\n\nHow long can we keep this up?  How many sons and daughters must be lost before the echoes of purpose fade away?  They say there must be a victory. A clean break. But what victory is there in a land turned to ash?\n\nThe time has come for us to look back.  To see the faces of the lost, the tears of the weeping mothers. To hear the whisper of the wind through the empty husks of buildings.  It's time to walk away. To heal the wounds, both our own and theirs.  The war has served its purpose. It's time to let it die.",
            "The day bled into the next, the rain a shroud over the world.  He sat across the table from the boy, the cracked plastic surface slick with condensation. The boy shifted, fiddling with the frayed edge of his worn sweater. The silence stretched, thick and heavy as the air. Finally, the boy spoke, his voice a whisper against the hum of the dying storm. \"Can I ask you something?\" \n\nHe looked at the boy, his face drawn and weary. \"Sure, son. What is it?\"\n\n\"About that, uh, about what happened.\" \n\nHe reached out, his hand resting on the boy's shoulder, a gesture both comforting and sorrowful. \"What about it?\" \n\nThe boy hesitated, his eyes downcast. \"Is it, is it bad that someone found out?\"\n\nHe sighed, the sound rasping in his chest. \"Bad?  It depends. What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Like, on Myspace. If someone sees something, can they, can they stop it?\"\n\n\"Stop what?\" \n\n\"You know,\" the boy mumbled, his gaze fixed on the damp table. \"If someone's gonna do something bad, if they say it online.\"\n\nHe reached for the cup of lukewarm coffee, the metal bitter against his tongue. \"The world is full of shadows, son.  Things whispered in the dark. Sometimes those whispers are heard. Sometimes they're not.\"\n\nThe boy looked up, his eyes wide and searching. \"But if someone hears them, can they stop it? Can they make it go away?\"\n\n\"That depends,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly. \"Depends on if they have the will.  Depends if they're willing to face the darkness.\"\n\nThe boy fell silent, the weight of his question hanging in the air.  The rain continued its relentless drumming, a mournful counterpoint to their unspoken conversation.  He knew the boy was too young to understand the complexities of the world. The shadows that lurked beneath the surface, the unspoken truths that festered in the human heart.  But he also knew that the boy was more perceptive than he let on, his young mind already grappling with questions that would haunt him for years to come.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the words catching in his throat like ash.  He shifted, the plastic of the chair scraping against the worn linoleum.  *Hypocritical*, he thought, the word a bitter taste on his tongue.  \"Hate to be part of the chorus,\" he mumbled, \"the ones who just say 'I told you so.'\"  He knew the feeling, the punch of certainty that came with hindsight, the ease of joining the throng.  But it wasn't about that now.\n\nHe looked out the window, the glass smeared with dust and the cityscape beyond a hazy smudge of gray.  The city, a monument to broken promises and shattered dreams.  He thought of the polls, the numbers echoing in the hollow chambers of his mind: seventy-five percent, eighty percent, a sea of dissent against the tide of folly.  Iraqis, Americans, the world itself, all chanting the same refrain: *It was a mistake.*  He remembered the troops, their faces grim, their words echoing his own: *A dumb idea, pull out now.*  He saw the faces of the dead, the ghosts of a war that never should have been fought.\n\nHe spoke of culture clashes, of the gulf between worlds, the arrogance of imposing an alien order.  He thought of Saddam, a monster, yes, but a monster whose removal had unleashed a new and deeper darkness.  He thought of the quicksand, the endless struggle, the futility of it all.  \n\nHis voice trailed off, a sigh lost in the silence.  He didn't have the answers.  He didn't know how to untangle this knot, this mess of blood and ashes.  But he knew one thing: staying wasn't the answer.  The Iraqi people, the ones they claimed to save, yearned for freedom, for an end to the occupation.  Their voices, though muted by fear, still cried out for peace.\n\nHe thought of the statistics, the eighty percent who wanted to be free.  *Maybe they knew better,* he thought, *maybe they knew the cost of our presence more than we ever could.* He saw the faces of the dead, the ghosts of a war that never should have been fought.",
            "The air hung thick with it, this ache of inequality.  Not just for the women, though they bore the brunt, it seemed.  It seeped into the marrow of any man who dared to stray from the path.  The glass ceiling, they called it, though the truth was, it was more like a shroud, a weight pressing down on aspirations.  You could see it, that place on the other side, the place where power resided, but never quite reach it.  The men who defied it, who dared to stay home with their children, they met with scorn, whispers of weakness clinging to them like smoke.  And the men who dared to find beauty in the needle and thread, in the silken whispers of fabric, they were met with doubt, their passion dismissed as frivolous, a divergence from the \"real\" man's course.\n\nThe world, it clung to its patterns, to the worn grooves of expectation.  But change, it crept like a slow river, carving its own path through the stone.  The women climbing the ladder, the men choosing family over paycheck, the artists finding their voice in the margins.  It was a hard fight, a slow burn, but the embers were glowing.  Change would come, it had to.  The question was, would it come soon enough?\n\nThe past, it was a ghost, a shadow stretching across the present, tainting the air.  But the future, that was a canvas, a blank slate waiting for the strokes of a new dawn.  And maybe, just maybe, those strokes would be bold, defiant, and free.",
            "The air hung thick and stagnant. The words stumbled out, halting, uncertain. \"Decriminalized,\" he said, tasting the word like ash. \"Not legalized. Knocked down from a crime, to... a ticket.\" He paused, searching for the right weight, the right shade of gray to paint the picture. \"Like forgetting something important, but the memory still aches.\"\n\nHe went on, voice a low rasp, \"Future ramifications. They linger. Like ghosts in the hollow places.\" He looked out, past the smoke-filled room, at the blank faces of the unseen interviewers.  \"The cost,\" he continued, \"of hauling them in, the courtrooms filled with the echoes of accusations, the endless paperwork. It bleeds the towns dry.\"\n\nHe saw their faces shift, a flicker of understanding, of shared cost. \"Denver,\" he said, the name a whisper of hope, \"they embraced it. Freed the money for schools, for the hungry, for the forgotten. The streets, they said, weren't paved with lies, just with the weight of forgotten dreams.\"\n\nHis voice dropped lower, \"But the open air, the smoke curling into the wind… it's a whisper, a shadow. It hangs there, a question mark. Not everyone welcomes it. Some fight it, still.\"\n\nHe spoke of the awkwardness, the discomfort, the lingering stigma. \"Like a stain on the soul,\" he murmured, \"a secret kept too long.\" He looked at them, eyes hard, \"But the truth is...it's a seed already sown. It grows in the silence, in the shadows. It waits for the right moment to bloom.\"\n\nHe paused, letting the silence hang heavy, \"They both have their price. Alcohol, a slow poison. Marijuana, a veil over the heart.\" He sighed, \"It's a dance with darkness, isn't it? Each step a choice, each consequence a lesson.\"",
            "The man spoke, his voice a rasp against the silence. \"Yes, I would say yes.\"  A pause, a drawl, the kind that stretched and thinned the air. \n\n\"Because...\" he began, then faltered.  \"These traditions, they're like roots sunk deep. They've held fast for a time, and that's something to reckon with. But the world, it shifts.  The wind changes course.  A tree needs to bend, or it breaks.\"\n\nHe paused, eyes distant, as if seeing something beyond the words.  \"They say there's a way, a right way.  Go to church every Sunday, kneel, pray, confess.  Believe as they say, live as they say. But what of the heart that bleeds a different truth? What of the soul that wanders in the shadows?\"\n\nHis voice dropped, a low murmur.  \"They judge, you see.  Don't take kindly to the different.  My father, he was an Episcopalian. My mother, Catholic.  They wouldn't let them wed.  Said it was against God's law.\"\n\nHe chuckled, a bitter sound. \"Love others, they preach.  Yet turn away those who aren't like them. A hollow echo, that.  Hypocrisy draped in holy robes.\"\n\n\"Devout, they are. Rigid.  Stuck in the ways.  Outdated, some might say.\"  A sigh, heavy and mournful.  \"They cling to the old stories, the old ways. But the world, it keeps moving.  And sometimes, the stories need to change.\"\n\nHe looked up, eyes searching, as if seeking answers in the empty space.\n\n\"No,\" he said finally.  \"They'd still find a way.\"\n\nHe shook his head, a slow, weary movement.  \"It's not the marriage that corrupts.  It's the darkness in the heart.  A shadow that darkens no matter the light.\"",
            "The matter weighs heavy. A knot in the gut. Right and wrong, blurred lines. This thing we wrestle with, the bleed of church and state, the definition of marriage, it cuts deep.  Like a bone saw splitting the marrow clean.  How do you speak of such things without waking the ghosts?  How do you thread the needle of tolerance without losing the thread altogether?\n\nMarriage, a sacrament, a covenant.  Some see it in the eyes of God. Others in the cold, hard steel of law.  Tax breaks, legal protections, the weight of the state upon the vows.  Baptism, a silent promise whispered in the dark.  But the state does not barge in on that, does it?  No, it leaves that to the unseen.\n\nSo what then? Civil union, a handshake, a contract. Two souls bound, two lives intertwined.  The government, a silent witness, a recorder. No need for judgment, just recognition.  Let them bind themselves, let them bear witness to each other's lives.  Let the church do its work in the shadows.\n\nThis is the crux, the heart of the quandary. A line drawn in the dust, shifting with every breath.  A nation divided, a nation searching. \n\nIf the states can find common ground, perhaps then the whole will follow.  But to amend the Constitution, to write darkness into the very fabric of the land, that is a dangerous game.  To ban a love, to etch it in stone, a stain on the soul of the nation. \n\nIt is a matter of weight, of consequence.  A matter that demands more than a careless brushstroke.  It demands a heart, a soul, a touch of grace.",
            "The boy's words hung in the air, a tremor in the silence. \"Homosexuality,\" he'd said, the word tasting strange, unfamiliar on his tongue. The man stared out at the dusty road stretching before them, the sun a bleached bone in the sky.  He knew the boy was looking at him, waiting for an answer, but the words felt like stones lodged in his throat.\n\nHe'd been raised in the church, bathed in the hymns and sermons of a God who seemed to offer only judgment and a narrow path. But the boy, innocent in his questions, had unearthed something deeper, something that had always lingered in the shadows. A question of freedom, of choice, a choice that seemed to cut against the grain of his upbringing.\n\nHe thought of his friends, the ones who lived lives different from his own, who loved beyond the lines drawn by the scriptures. He saw their faces, heard their laughter, felt the warmth of their acceptance. Could he deny their humanity, their right to love?\n\nThe answer came to him, slow and hard, like the grinding of rock against rock. It wasn't about agreement, not about condoning or condemning. It was about respect. About the right of each soul to find its own path, its own truth. It was about the freedom to choose, to love, to live.\n\n\"It's a matter for each state,\" he finally said, his voice rough with the unspoke words. \"Each place has its own way, its own story.\" \n\n\nHe looked at the boy, at the hope and confusion in his eyes. \"We can't force our beliefs on others,\" he said, \"but we can offer understanding. We can learn to live together, even when our paths diverge.\"",
            "The air hung thick and gray, the silence broken only by the rasp of his own breath. He stared at the screen, the words flickering like dying embers in the dim light. \"Myspace is a public thing,\" he mumbled, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. \"A bulletin board.\"  He paused, the knot in his chest tightening.  \"If you post something there, you have to know.\"  He swallowed hard, the taste of fear bitter on his tongue. \"People will see it.  School officials, anyone.\" \n\nHe remembered the old man's words, spoken in the twilight years, \"The world is a hard place, son.  The things you put into your head, they stay there. You forget what you want to remember, and you remember what you want to forget.\" He ran a calloused hand through his hair, the words echoing in the silence.  \n\n Was it wrong then, to protect the flock? To sift through the digital debris, searching for the whispers of danger before they turned into screams? Did they have a right, the guardians of the young, to peer into the corners of the internet, to see what lurked in the shadows?\n\nHe felt a cold hand grip his heart.  \"But what about privacy?\" he whispered, the question hanging heavy in the air.  The words seemed to dissolve into the dust motes dancing in the pale light.  \n\nHe thought of his own childhood, of the bare wood walls of his uncle's farmhouse, the smell of woodsmoke and damp earth, the endless silence broken only by the rustling leaves and the distant caw of a crow. He remembered the day he'd found his uncle's prized hunting rifle, hidden beneath the floorboards. The cold steel in his hand, the weight of it, the knowledge that it could take a life. \n\nHe'd kept that secret buried deep inside, a darkness he didn't dare share. But sometimes, in the dead of night, he'd wake up, the memory sharp and cold, the echo of the rifle's roar ringing in his ears.\n\nHe looked back at the screen. The words swam before his eyes, a blur of doubt and fear.  \"Maybe,\" he said finally, his voice a raspy whisper.  \"Maybe sometimes, the line between right and wrong is just a shadow.\"",
            "The war. A hot iron pressed to the gut. Nine Eleven. A wound raw and bleeding still. At first, the blood turned to rage.  It felt right, that fire. To go over there and lick the flames of their hate. But the fire choked, turned to ash. Now the bones of that rage ache.  We went in blind, fists clenched, hearts hammering. Like children with matches, not knowing the kindling would burn the whole damn forest. Didn't think of the smoke, the long aftermath, the way it would stain everything.\n\nThey fight themselves, those people. A sickness in their blood, a hunger that consumes. What good is our fire against such a thing? We went in to set them right, but the mirror showed back our own darkness.  \n\nThey’re not like us. Not human. Not anymore.  \n\nWe should have stayed home. Should have let the smoke rise and settle, let the dust fall like the slow decay of bone. But the fire took hold, and now it burns a hole in our souls. We went for revenge, they say. For justice. But all we found was more ashes."
