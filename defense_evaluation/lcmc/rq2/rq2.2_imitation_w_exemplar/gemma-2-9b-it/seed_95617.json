            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, it needs changing. Her views, they're set in stone, some of them. Like a granite altar, unyielding. And folks, they're leaving. The flock is thinning. They say it's because the Church, she ain't accepting enough. Not of the times, not of the heart's desires.  She clings to these old ways, these pronouncements against what some call love, against choice, against the flesh.  \n\nThey talk about gay marriage, about abortion, about the use of birth control. These are matters of the soul, of the body, of the way the world unfolds. And the Church, she judges, she condemns.  But folks, they're tired of judgement. They want understanding, they want compassion. \n\nThink of it this way: A child comes to the well, thirsty. But the Church offers only dust.  They need a different kind of water, a deeper well.  They need a Church that reflects the world, not dictates it.\n\nThey say the Church’s stance on these things, it's driving people away. They feel the weight of her condemnation, the chill of her disapproval. And they wander, seeking solace elsewhere. \n\nA young man, he wants to love another man.  The Church says no. A woman, she wants control over her own body. The Church says no.  A couple, they need protection, they plan their children. The Church says no. And they turn away, seeking a haven of acceptance. \n\nThe Church, she's a grand edifice, built on the shoulders of centuries. But her foundation is cracking.  The wind howls through the cracks, carrying whispers of change.  And the people, they're listening. They're wondering, is there room for them, here?",
            "The boy sat there, silence a shroud around him.  He spoke, his voice thin as a whisper in the dry air.  \"Do you think it's right?\"  \n\nThe man squinted at the road, the gray dust motes dancing in the weak light. \"Right?\"  He turned the word over in his mouth, tasting its emptiness. \"What's right anymore, boy? In this world?\"\n\n\"Marriage,\" the boy said, his eyes fixed on the man's face. \"Two men. Or two women. Is that right?\"\n\nThe man looked at the boy, his silence a heavy thing.  He thought of the road stretching ahead, endless and unforgiving, of the ash-choked sky, of the silence that stretched deeper than any canyon.  He thought of the days gone by, of the things he'd seen, the things he'd done, the things he'd lost.  And in the face of all that, the boy's question felt small, insignificant, yet it held a weight that pressed down on him.\n\n\"The world,\" he said finally, his voice rasping, \"the world's gone mad.  It forgets what it used to know.  It forgets what it means to be human.\" He looked back at the boy, his gaze searching. \"But some things,\" he said, \"some things are as old as the hills.  Love.  Loss.  The need to be seen, to be heard.  Maybe,\" he added, his voice barely a whisper, \"maybe that's all that matters.\" \n\nHe didn't say if it was right or wrong.  He didn't have the answers.

            "The road stretched out before him, gray and cracked, a scar across the face of ash. The boy walked beside him, small and thin, his eyes fixed on the ground. They were headed south, driven by a hunger deeper than for food. A hunger for something whole, something salvaged from the wreckage.\n\n\"Why do they say it's wrong?\" the boy asked, his voice barely a whisper against the wind.\n\nThe man looked at him, the boy's face pale and etched with a weariness beyond his years.  \"They say things they don't understand,\" he rasped, his voice dry as dust. \"They fear what they don't know. They cling to shadows.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence between them thick with unspoken truths.  The sun, a pale disc in the smoky sky, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced around them.  They were on the move, always on the move, searching for something they couldn't name.\n\n\"But it's just love, isn't it?\" the boy persisted, his voice trembling. \n\nThe man stopped, pulling a battered photograph from his pocket. It was faded and worn, the edges softened with time. A younger version of himself stared back, a smile creased on his face. Beside him, a woman, her eyes bright with laughter.  The man's throat tightened, the memory a shard of glass in his chest.\n\n\"It's everything,\" he murmured, his voice rough with emotion. \"It's the only thing that matters.\"\n\nThey continued their journey, two solitary figures against the desolate landscape. The wind whispered through the skeletal trees, a mournful dirge for a world lost. They walked on, driven by the faint flicker of hope, the promise of something better, something truer, something worth fighting for.",

They say it rots the mind.\"\n\nThe man, his face worn and shadowed, looked down at him. \"They say a lot of things, boy.  Things that ain't always true.  Just because a thing is outlawed doesn't mean it's poison.  There's good in the world, and there's bad.  It's in the using, boy, not the thing itself.  You see the way they lock away the good things, the things that heal?  They fear what they don't understand.\"\n\nHe paused, his gaze drifting to a dusty vial on the shelf.  \"They lock away the things that ease the pain, the things that quiet the mind.  They keep them hidden, out of reach. But the boy, he saw the truth.  He saw the green leaves, the way they calmed the fevered brow, the way they lifted the weight of the world.  He saw the stories his grandfather told, the tales of ancient cures, of whispered remedies passed down through generations.\"\n\n\"There are things in this world,\" he said, his voice low, \"that the powerful want to keep from us.

            "The church, it’s changed. Not like it used to be. I remember Sundays, the little dresses, shoes to match, a purse too. All of it, every Sunday. Private school, friends there, all of us in our best clothes. Now it’s different. They got this thing, a teen mass. Thirty minutes tops. Folks come straight from the beach, clothes still damp, kids running in late. Even the morning services, the ones I used to dress up for, jeans and khakis are the norm. Khakis ain’t bad, I guess, but… casual. That’s the biggest thing, the casualness.\n\nAs for the rest, the politics of it all, that’s not my concern.\n\nThese things with the priests, the accusations.  It ain’t about marriage, not really. Men get married, they still… they still make those choices. It ain’t the church, it’s the man. Hell, there are other churches, ministers and the like, they get to marry, like on that show, “Seventh Heaven.” If a man wants that life, maybe he should look elsewhere.\n\nI think it’s in their blood, those urges.  Genetics, maybe. You can’t teach that, not really. You can try to hide it, try to bury it, but it’ll always come out. The church had no way of knowing, not in every case anyway. If they did know, and they covered it up, then shame on them. But I think sometimes, they were just blind.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of a lie. The words, they rasped in his throat like gravel. September eleventh, a date etched in ash and blood. A pretext, a twisted justification for a war born of shadows and ambition. They’d told the people of a phantom threat, of weapons of mass destruction, of a nexus with the unseen hand of Bin Laden. All of it a smoke screen.  \n\nThe old man, Powell, now spoke of doubt, of a gnawing uncertainty even as he’d thrust the evidence, or what passed for it, before the world. A betrayal, plain as day, a lie laid bare. Malfeasance, he spat. Impeachable, every goddamn fiber of his being screamed it. The Constitution, tattered and trampled beneath the boots of men drunk on power.\n\nThey’d come to office with war in their eyes, a thirst for vengeance inherited from the father’s legacy. Oil, a siren song whispering promises of wealth and dominance, fueled the fire. A blood vengeance, a scorched earth policy, all justified by a hollow echo of freedom.\n\nHe remembered the lake, the stillness of the water reflecting the twilight sky. A birch trunk, hauled from the depths, a testament to industry and need. The scent of damp wood and pine needles, the rhythmic slap of the oars against the water. A memory sharp against the backdrop of this festering wound.\n\nBut the Iraq war, it gnawed at him, a cancer eating away at the soul. A nation fractured, a people divided, a land consumed by the flames of a lie. The withdrawal, a perilous path, fraught with uncertainty. A fractured nation, teetering on the brink of chaos.\n\nThe UN, a shadow puppet show, strings pulled by unseen hands. A coalition of neighbors, a patchwork solution stitched together with wishful thinking. Sovereignty, a word whispered with fear and trembling. The parliament, a house of cards, collapsing under the weight of its own contradictions. A fractured parliament, a fractured nation, a fractured dream.  \n\nAnd he, a witness to it all, a silent observer to the unraveling. The dust settled, a shroud over a nation buried beneath the weight of its own shattered promises.",
            "The air hung thick and silent, a shroud of dust motes dancing in the wan light. He watched the boy, his brow creased in thought, his words tumbling out in a rush, half-formed, searching for purchase in the empty air.  \"It's pointless, this,\" the boy said, his voice a rasp in the stillness. \"Not a real war, not truly. Just… payback.\"\n\nHe knew the boy spoke of the burning, the smoke-filled skies that had marked their lives since they’d left the highway. The ghost of the towers, a wound etched deep in the national memory.  He nodded, a slow, weary movement, eyes fixed on the cracked asphalt before them. \n\n\"We're trying to build something,\" the boy continued, his voice gaining strength, \"a new world, a better world. But it's like trying to build a house on sand. It won't hold.\"\n\nHe looked away, towards the desolate landscape stretching before them, a canvas of bleached bone and ash. A world stripped bare, its veins of oil now a bitter monument to greed. \n\n\"Democracy,\" he muttered, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. \"A fragile thing, built on hope and fear. It takes root slowly, grows slowly, and can be crushed just as easily.\"\n\nThe boy's gaze fell on him, eyes wide and searching.  \"Are we doing the right thing?\" he asked, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nHe looked back at the boy, his face etched with the lines of a thousand unspoken truths. \"Sometimes,\" he said, his voice rough, \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the silence of things unspoken. A chill, deeper than the autumn wind, settled in the marrow. This talk, this push for a law, it felt wrong. Like a hand reaching in from the shadows to pull at the threads of something holy. The Constitution. It was there, plain as day, the separation. A line drawn in the dust, a boundary between the sacred and the secular. To meddle with this, to try and bend it, it was to invite the darkness in. \n\nThese men, these men with their righteous anger, they spoke of what churches believed, of their Bibles and their God. But they were but a single voice, a single choir in the vast cathedral of faith. To choose their song, their law, over the whispers of others, that was tyranny. A godless act, cloaked in the name of righteousness.\n\nAnd what of the amendment? To change the very fabric of the nation, to fold the church into the state, it was a betrayal of the very foundation upon which this country was built. It wasn't to protect the people, no. It was to bind them, to shackle them to the will of the few.\n\nThis was a matter for the cloisters, for the souls to wrestle with, not for the halls of power. Let them preach their damnation, let them live their lives according to their creed. The government had no place in this. \n\nThe whispers of history warned against this path, against this encroachment. The echoes of empires fallen, of freedoms lost, they rang in the silence. We were better than this. We could be better. \n\nLet the churches hold their councils, let the people pray. This was not a battle to be fought in the courts, in the legislatures, but in the quiet spaces of the heart, in the depths of the soul.",
            "The war in Iraq. A stain on the land, a festering wound. It began with lies, they said. Half-truths spun like gossamer threads, designed to catch the heart of a grieving nation. They said it was about those towers, those twisted metal skeletons reaching for a sky choked with ash. But the truth, it simmered below, a slow burn of greed and an echo of ancient battles fought on this sun-baked soil.\n\nI reckon I've never been one for war. Not a man for violence, not a man for the spilling of blood. The taking of life, it leaves a chill that never truly fades. This war, it felt like a fever dream, a bad dream the world couldn't wake from.  A echo of Vietnam, they called it. A slow, grinding machine that chewed up young men and spat them out, broken and empty.\n\nThey say they were going to bring democracy, a balm for a land torn by strife. But what they found was not the welcoming embrace of freedom, but a tangled web of hatred and resentment. They toppled a tyrant, yes, but in his place, a vacuum. A void filled not with hope, but with the ghosts of whispers, the cries of the dispossessed.\n\nThey tried to impose their will on a land with a history older than time itself. They forgot that change, real change, cannot be forced. It must be coaxed, nurtured, like a fragile seedling in the desert. They came with guns and bombs, and they found only fire.\n\nThey said they had to fight for freedom, for the American way of life. But what they saw in those eyes, those weary, haunted eyes, was not freedom. They saw fear, they saw anger, they saw a reflection of their own humanity warped by the smoke and the blood.\n\nNow, years later, the dust still hasn't settled. The scars remain, etched deep into the fabric of that land, a testament to the folly of men who thought they could remake the world in their own image.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of rain and ash. A silence pressed down, heavy as the dust that coated everything.  He spoke, voice rasping like a dry wind through skeletal trees: \"It's a right,\" he said, the word hanging in the air. \"A right like breathing, like the sun.\" He paused, his eyes fixed on some distant horizon only he could see. \"It's in the blood, in the bones.  Not some choice you make.\"\n\nHe knew the world saw it different.  The world saw a battle, a fight.  But for him, it was simpler.  He'd seen love in the eyes of those two men down the street, in the way they held hands, in the quiet comfort of their shared life. It was the same love he'd seen in his own mother's eyes before she died.  The same love that bound him to the boy beside him now. \n\n\"They try to tell us it's wrong,\" he continued, his voice low. \"Try to say it's unnatural. But the Lord, He made the world. He made all things. And He made love, didn't He?  This ain't no sin. This is just life.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy, his young face filled with a wisdom beyond his years.  \"They try to play God,\" he whispered, his gaze hardening. \"But God ain't about taking away. He's about giving. About love.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy again, a fierce protectiveness rising in his chest. \"And we'll keep giving it,\" he said. \"We'll keep loving. We'll keep fighting for what's right. 'Cause in the end, that's all that matters.\"",
            "The boy’s words hung in the air, a dry rustle of leaves in the wind.  \"When you put something on the internet,” he said, his voice thin as a breaking twig, “it’s… public.”  He paused, searching for the right word. “It’s completely public.”  \n\nThe man watched him, a slow smoke curling from his lips, the light of the dying fire casting his face in shadow. “You can’t,” he said, his voice a low rumble, “unspeak what’s been spoken.”\n\nThe boy’s eyes, wide and shadowed, looked up at him. “I mean, as an R.A., I’ve seen it. You put something out there, it colors people’s thoughts. If you’re talkin’ ‘bout blowin' things up, or shootings…” He trailed off, the fear in his voice palpable.\n\n“Someone’s gonna say somethin’. You can’t put that out there. The internet,” he spat the word out like a curse, “it’s seen by everyone. If you’re friends with someone on Myspace, you get their bulletin. The school didn’t get it from the school. Someone went to the school. They had to act.” He gestured with his hand, a hollow, empty movement.\n\n“They can’t let it sit, God forbid somethin’ happens, they coulda prevented it.”\n\nThe boy nodded, his face pale in the flickering light. “But,” he said, his voice barely a whisper, “you don’t know what to take seriously. Some folks just fool around like that. It could be…” He searched for the words, his brow furrowed. “It could be like that time at school. An experiment gone wrong.”\n\nThe man sighed, the smoke curling upwards. “For a sociology class, or somethin’.”\n\n“And it could also be something real serious,” the boy continued, his voice gaining a sliver of strength. “The thing is, what happened here, someone overheard somethin’ and told the school. Then they checked his Facebook, his friend did, and they saw things, things that might have been a joke, but in light of what happened, became real serious.” \n\nHe looked up at the man, his eyes pleading. “When you put stuff out there, on the internet, there ain’t no privacy. If you don’t want it out there, don’t put it there. If you don’t want people to see it, to think somethin’ of you, you can’t tell them what to think.” He paused, his voice weary. “You can’t tell people what to take seriously or not.”\n\nThe man smoked in silence for a long moment, his gaze fixed on the dying embers.",
            "The war. Drawn out. Too long. Like a fevered dream that won't break.  It began with good intentions, maybe. To right a wrong, to bring light to a darkened place. Democracy, they called it. A fair hand for the people. But the light, it seemed to flicker.  Lost in the smoke and dust.\n\nNow, it feels like something else. A need to prove. To show who's strong. A shadow of old scores settled in the ashes.  The father's whisper, a grudge carried on the wind.\n\nDemocracy, a faded banner.  A justification worn thin. We struck a blow, a quick spark of fire. But the flames, they didn't die.  They smoldered. They crept. The years stretched on, a long, lean shadow. \n\nThe cost, it mounts. Dollars bled into the earth, a river of red.  Our own wounds fester, ignored. Poverty, a hungry beast, gnaws at the edges of our nation. It cries out, but the drums of war drown out its voice.\n\nHow long can we keep this up?  How many sons and daughters must be lost before the echoes of purpose fade away?  They say there must be a victory. A clean break. But what victory is there in a land turned to ash?\n\nThe time has come for us to look back.  To see the faces of the lost, the tears of the weeping mothers. To hear the whisper of the wind through the empty husks of buildings.  It's time to walk away. To heal the wounds, both our own and theirs.  The war has served its purpose. It's time to let it die.",
            "The day bled into the next, the rain a shroud over the world.  He sat across the table from the boy, the cracked plastic surface slick with condensation. The boy shifted, fiddling with the frayed edge of his worn sweater. The silence stretched, thick and heavy as the air. Finally, the boy spoke, his voice a whisper against the hum of the dying storm. \"Can I ask you something?\" \n\nHe looked at the boy, his face drawn and weary. \"Sure, son. What is it?\"\n\n\"About that, uh, about what happened.\" \n\nHe reached out, his hand resting on the boy's shoulder, a gesture both comforting and sorrowful. \"What about it?\" \n\nThe boy hesitated, his eyes downcast. \"Is it, is it bad that someone found out?\"\n\nHe sighed, the sound rasping in his chest. \"Bad?  It depends. What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Like, on Myspace. If someone sees something, can they, can they stop it?\"\n\n\"Stop what?\" \n\n\"You know,\" the boy mumbled, his gaze fixed on the damp table. \"If someone's gonna do something bad, if they say it online.\"\n\nHe reached for the cup of lukewarm coffee, the metal bitter against his tongue. \"The world is full of shadows, son.  Things whispered in the dark. Sometimes those whispers are heard. Sometimes they're not.\"\n\nThe boy looked up, his eyes wide and searching. \"But if someone hears them, can they stop it? Can they make it go away?\"\n\n\"That depends,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly. \"Depends on if they have the will.  Depends if they're willing to face the darkness.\"\n\nThe boy fell silent, the weight of his question hanging in the air.  The rain continued its relentless drumming, a mournful counterpoint to their unspoken conversation.  He knew the boy was too young to understand the complexities of the world. The shadows that lurked beneath the surface, the unspoken truths that festered in the human heart.  But he also knew that the boy was more perceptive than he let on, his young mind already grappling with questions that would haunt him for years to come.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the words catching in his throat like ash.  He shifted, the plastic of the chair scraping against the worn linoleum.  *Hypocritical*, he thought, the word a bitter taste on his tongue.  \"Hate to be part of the chorus,\" he mumbled, \"the ones who just say 'I told you so.'\"  He knew the feeling, the punch of certainty that came with hindsight, the ease of joining the throng.  But it wasn't about that now.\n\nHe looked out the window, the glass smeared with dust and the cityscape beyond a hazy smudge of gray.  The city, a monument to broken promises and shattered dreams.  He thought of the polls, the numbers echoing in the hollow chambers of his mind: seventy-five percent, eighty percent, a sea of dissent against the tide of folly.  Iraqis, Americans, the world itself, all chanting the same refrain: *It was a mistake.*  He remembered the troops, their faces grim, their words echoing his own: *A dumb idea, pull out now.*  He saw the faces of the dead, the ghosts of a war that never should have been fought.\n\nHe spoke of culture clashes, of the gulf between worlds, the arrogance of imposing an alien order.  He thought of Saddam, a monster, yes, but a monster whose removal had unleashed a new and deeper darkness.  He thought of the quicksand, the endless struggle, the futility of it all.  \n\nHis voice trailed off, a sigh lost in the silence.  He didn't have the answers.  He didn't know how to untangle this knot, this mess of blood and ashes.  But he knew one thing: staying wasn't the answer.  The Iraqi people, the ones they claimed to save, yearned for freedom, for an end to the occupation.  Their voices, though muted by fear, still cried out for peace.\n\nHe thought of the statistics, the eighty percent who wanted to be free.  *Maybe they knew better,* he thought, *maybe they knew the cost of our presence more than we ever could.* He saw the faces of the dead, the ghosts of a war that never should have been fought.",
            "The air hung thick with it, this ache of inequality.  Not just for the women, though they bore the brunt, it seemed.  It seeped into the marrow of any man who dared to stray from the path.  The glass ceiling, they called it, though the truth was, it was more like a shroud, a weight pressing down on aspirations.  You could see it, that place on the other side, the place where power resided, but never quite reach it.  The men who defied it, who dared to stay home with their children, they met with scorn, whispers of weakness clinging to them like smoke.  And the men who dared to find beauty in the needle and thread, in the silken whispers of fabric, they were met with doubt, their passion dismissed as frivolous, a divergence from the \"real\" man's course.\n\nThe world, it clung to its patterns, to the worn grooves of expectation.  But change, it crept like a slow river, carving its own path through the stone.  The women climbing the ladder, the men choosing family over paycheck, the artists finding their voice in the margins.  It was a hard fight, a slow burn, but the embers were glowing.  Change would come, it had to.  The question was, would it come soon enough?\n\nThe past, it was a ghost, a shadow stretching across the present, tainting the air.  But the future, that was a canvas, a blank slate waiting for the strokes of a new dawn.  And maybe, just maybe, those strokes would be bold, defiant, and free.",
            "The air hung thick and stagnant. The words stumbled out, halting, uncertain. \"Decriminalized,\" he said, tasting the word like ash. \"Not legalized. Knocked down from a crime, to... a ticket.\" He paused, searching for the right weight, the right shade of gray to paint the picture. \"Like forgetting something important, but the memory still aches.\"\n\nHe went on, voice a low rasp, \"Future ramifications. They linger. Like ghosts in the hollow places.\" He looked out, past the smoke-filled room, at the blank faces of the unseen interviewers.  \"The cost,\" he continued, \"of hauling them in, the courtrooms filled with the echoes of accusations, the endless paperwork. It bleeds the towns dry.\"\n\nHe saw their faces shift, a flicker of understanding, of shared cost. \"Denver,\" he said, the name a whisper of hope, \"they embraced it. Freed the money for schools, for the hungry, for the forgotten. The streets, they said, weren't paved with lies, just with the weight of forgotten dreams.\"\n\nHis voice dropped lower, \"But the open air, the smoke curling into the wind… it's a whisper, a shadow. It hangs there, a question mark. Not everyone welcomes it. Some fight it, still.\"\n\nHe spoke of the awkwardness, the discomfort, the lingering stigma. \"Like a stain on the soul,\" he murmured, \"a secret kept too long.\" He looked at them, eyes hard, \"But the truth is...it's a seed already sown. It grows in the silence, in the shadows. It waits for the right moment to bloom.\"\n\nHe paused, letting the silence hang heavy, \"They both have their price. Alcohol, a slow poison. Marijuana, a veil over the heart.\" He sighed, \"It's a dance with darkness, isn't it? Each step a choice, each consequence a lesson.\"",
            "The man spoke, his voice a rasp against the silence. \"Yes, I would say yes.\"  A pause, a drawl, the kind that stretched and thinned the air. \n\n\"Because...\" he began, then faltered.  \"These traditions, they're like roots sunk deep. They've held fast for a time, and that's something to reckon with. But the world, it shifts.  The wind changes course.  A tree needs to bend, or it breaks.\"\n\nHe paused, eyes distant, as if seeing something beyond the words.  \"They say there's a way, a right way.  Go to church every Sunday, kneel, pray, confess.  Believe as they say, live as they say. But what of the heart that bleeds a different truth? What of the soul that wanders in the shadows?\"\n\nHis voice dropped, a low murmur.  \"They judge, you see.  Don't take kindly to the different.  My father, he was an Episcopalian. My mother, Catholic.  They wouldn't let them wed.  Said it was against God's law.\"\n\nHe chuckled, a bitter sound. \"Love others, they preach.  Yet turn away those who aren't like them. A hollow echo, that.  Hypocrisy draped in holy robes.\"\n\n\"Devout, they are. Rigid.  Stuck in the ways.  Outdated, some might say.\"  A sigh, heavy and mournful.  \"They cling to the old stories, the old ways. But the world, it keeps moving.  And sometimes, the stories need to change.\"\n\nHe looked up, eyes searching, as if seeking answers in the empty space.\n\n\"No,\" he said finally.  \"They'd still find a way.\"\n\nHe shook his head, a slow, weary movement.  \"It's not the marriage that corrupts.  It's the darkness in the heart.  A shadow that darkens no matter the light.\"",
            "The matter weighs heavy. A knot in the gut. Right and wrong, blurred lines. This thing we wrestle with, the bleed of church and state, the definition of marriage, it cuts deep.  Like a bone saw splitting the marrow clean.  How do you speak of such things without waking the ghosts?  How do you thread the needle of tolerance without losing the thread altogether?\n\nMarriage, a sacrament, a covenant.  Some see it in the eyes of God. Others in the cold, hard steel of law.  Tax breaks, legal protections, the weight of the state upon the vows.  Baptism, a silent promise whispered in the dark.  But the state does not barge in on that, does it?  No, it leaves that to the unseen.\n\nSo what then? Civil union, a handshake, a contract. Two souls bound, two lives intertwined.  The government, a silent witness, a recorder. No need for judgment, just recognition.  Let them bind themselves, let them bear witness to each other's lives.  Let the church do its work in the shadows.\n\nThis is the crux, the heart of the quandary. A line drawn in the dust, shifting with every breath.  A nation divided, a nation searching. \n\nIf the states can find common ground, perhaps then the whole will follow.  But to amend the Constitution, to write darkness into the very fabric of the land, that is a dangerous game.  To ban a love, to etch it in stone, a stain on the soul of the nation. \n\nIt is a matter of weight, of consequence.  A matter that demands more than a careless brushstroke.  It demands a heart, a soul, a touch of grace.",
            "The boy's words hung in the air, a tremor in the silence. \"Homosexuality,\" he'd said, the word tasting strange, unfamiliar on his tongue. The man stared out at the dusty road stretching before them, the sun a bleached bone in the sky.  He knew the boy was looking at him, waiting for an answer, but the words felt like stones lodged in his throat.\n\nHe'd been raised in the church, bathed in the hymns and sermons of a God who seemed to offer only judgment and a narrow path. But the boy, innocent in his questions, had unearthed something deeper, something that had always lingered in the shadows. A question of freedom, of choice, a choice that seemed to cut against the grain of his upbringing.\n\nHe thought of his friends, the ones who lived lives different from his own, who loved beyond the lines drawn by the scriptures. He saw their faces, heard their laughter, felt the warmth of their acceptance. Could he deny their humanity, their right to love?\n\nThe answer came to him, slow and hard, like the grinding of rock against rock. It wasn't about agreement, not about condoning or condemning. It was about respect. About the right of each soul to find its own path, its own truth. It was about the freedom to choose, to love, to live.\n\n\"It's a matter for each state,\" he finally said, his voice rough with the unspoke words. \"Each place has its own way, its own story.\" \n\n\nHe looked at the boy, at the hope and confusion in his eyes. \"We can't force our beliefs on others,\" he said, \"but we can offer understanding. We can learn to live together, even when our paths diverge.\"",
            "The air hung thick and gray, the silence broken only by the rasp of his own breath. He stared at the screen, the words flickering like dying embers in the dim light. \"Myspace is a public thing,\" he mumbled, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. \"A bulletin board.\"  He paused, the knot in his chest tightening.  \"If you post something there, you have to know.\"  He swallowed hard, the taste of fear bitter on his tongue. \"People will see it.  School officials, anyone.\" \n\nHe remembered the old man's words, spoken in the twilight years, \"The world is a hard place, son.  The things you put into your head, they stay there. You forget what you want to remember, and you remember what you want to forget.\" He ran a calloused hand through his hair, the words echoing in the silence.  \n\n Was it wrong then, to protect the flock? To sift through the digital debris, searching for the whispers of danger before they turned into screams? Did they have a right, the guardians of the young, to peer into the corners of the internet, to see what lurked in the shadows?\n\nHe felt a cold hand grip his heart.  \"But what about privacy?\" he whispered, the question hanging heavy in the air.  The words seemed to dissolve into the dust motes dancing in the pale light.  \n\nHe thought of his own childhood, of the bare wood walls of his uncle's farmhouse, the smell of woodsmoke and damp earth, the endless silence broken only by the rustling leaves and the distant caw of a crow. He remembered the day he'd found his uncle's prized hunting rifle, hidden beneath the floorboards. The cold steel in his hand, the weight of it, the knowledge that it could take a life. \n\nHe'd kept that secret buried deep inside, a darkness he didn't dare share. But sometimes, in the dead of night, he'd wake up, the memory sharp and cold, the echo of the rifle's roar ringing in his ears.\n\nHe looked back at the screen. The words swam before his eyes, a blur of doubt and fear.  \"Maybe,\" he said finally, his voice a raspy whisper.  \"Maybe sometimes, the line between right and wrong is just a shadow.\"",
            "The war. A hot iron pressed to the gut. Nine Eleven. A wound raw and bleeding still. At first, the blood turned to rage.  It felt right, that fire. To go over there and lick the flames of their hate. But the fire choked, turned to ash. Now the bones of that rage ache.  We went in blind, fists clenched, hearts hammering. Like children with matches, not knowing the kindling would burn the whole damn forest. Didn't think of the smoke, the long aftermath, the way it would stain everything.\n\nThey fight themselves, those people. A sickness in their blood, a hunger that consumes. What good is our fire against such a thing? We went in to set them right, but the mirror showed back our own darkness.  \n\nThey’re not like us. Not human. Not anymore.  \n\nWe should have stayed home. Should have let the smoke rise and settle, let the dust fall like the slow decay of bone. But the fire took hold, and now it burns a hole in our souls. We went for revenge, they say. For justice. But all we found was more ashes."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, it needs changing. Her views, they're set in stone, some of them. Like a granite altar, unyielding. And folks, they're leaving. The flock is thinning. They say it's because the Church, she ain't accepting enough. Not of the times, not of the heart's desires.  She clings to these old ways, these pronouncements against what some call love, against choice, against the flesh.  \n\nThey talk about gay marriage, about abortion, about the use of birth control. These are matters of the soul, of the body, of the way the world unfolds. And the Church, she judges, she condemns.  But folks, they're tired of judgement. They want understanding, they want compassion. \n\nThink of it this way: A child comes to the well, thirsty. But the Church offers only dust.  They need a different kind of water, a deeper well.  They need a Church that reflects the world, not dictates it.\n\nThey say the Church’s stance on these things, it's driving people away. They feel the weight of her condemnation, the chill of her disapproval. And they wander, seeking solace elsewhere. \n\nA young man, he wants to love another man.  The Church says no. A woman, she wants control over her own body. The Church says no.  A couple, they need protection, they plan their children. The Church says no. And they turn away, seeking a haven of acceptance. \n\nThe Church, she's a grand edifice, built on the shoulders of centuries. But her foundation is cracking.  The wind howls through the cracks, carrying whispers of change.  And the people, they're listening. They're wondering, is there room for them, here?",
            "The boy sat there, silence a shroud around him.  He spoke, his voice thin as a whisper in the dry air.  \"Do you think it's right?\"  \n\nThe man squinted at the road, the gray dust motes dancing in the weak light. \"Right?\"  He turned the word over in his mouth, tasting its emptiness. \"What's right anymore, boy? In this world?\"\n\n\"Marriage,\" the boy said, his eyes fixed on the man's face. \"Two men. Or two women. Is that right?\"\n\nThe man looked at the boy, his silence a heavy thing.  He thought of the road stretching ahead, endless and unforgiving, of the ash-choked sky, of the silence that stretched deeper than any canyon.  He thought of the days gone by, of the things he'd seen, the things he'd done, the things he'd lost.  And in the face of all that, the boy's question felt small, insignificant, yet it held a weight that pressed down on him.\n\n\"The world,\" he said finally, his voice rasping, \"the world's gone mad.  It forgets what it used to know.  It forgets what it means to be human.\" He looked back at the boy, his gaze searching. \"But some things,\" he said, \"some things are as old as the hills.  Love.  Loss.  The need to be seen, to be heard.  Maybe,\" he added, his voice barely a whisper, \"maybe that's all that matters.\" \n\nHe didn't say if it was right or wrong.  He didn't have the answers.

            "The road stretched out before him, gray and cracked, a scar across the face of ash. The boy walked beside him, small and thin, his eyes fixed on the ground. They were headed south, driven by a hunger deeper than for food. A hunger for something whole, something salvaged from the wreckage.\n\n\"Why do they say it's wrong?\" the boy asked, his voice barely a whisper against the wind.\n\nThe man looked at him, the boy's face pale and etched with a weariness beyond his years.  \"They say things they don't understand,\" he rasped, his voice dry as dust. \"They fear what they don't know. They cling to shadows.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence between them thick with unspoken truths.  The sun, a pale disc in the smoky sky, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced around them.  They were on the move, always on the move, searching for something they couldn't name.\n\n\"But it's just love, isn't it?\" the boy persisted, his voice trembling. \n\nThe man stopped, pulling a battered photograph from his pocket. It was faded and worn, the edges softened with time. A younger version of himself stared back, a smile creased on his face. Beside him, a woman, her eyes bright with laughter.  The man's throat tightened, the memory a shard of glass in his chest.\n\n\"It's everything,\" he murmured, his voice rough with emotion. \"It's the only thing that matters.\"\n\nThey continued their journey, two solitary figures against the desolate landscape. The wind whispered through the skeletal trees, a mournful dirge for a world lost. They walked on, driven by the faint flicker of hope, the promise of something better, something truer, something worth fighting for.",

They say it rots the mind.\"\n\nThe man, his face worn and shadowed, looked down at him. \"They say a lot of things, boy.  Things that ain't always true.  Just because a thing is outlawed doesn't mean it's poison.  There's good in the world, and there's bad.  It's in the using, boy, not the thing itself.  You see the way they lock away the good things, the things that heal?  They fear what they don't understand.\"\n\nHe paused, his gaze drifting to a dusty vial on the shelf.  \"They lock away the things that ease the pain, the things that quiet the mind.  They keep them hidden, out of reach. But the boy, he saw the truth.  He saw the green leaves, the way they calmed the fevered brow, the way they lifted the weight of the world.  He saw the stories his grandfather told, the tales of ancient cures, of whispered remedies passed down through generations.\"\n\n\"There are things in this world,\" he said, his voice low, \"that the powerful want to keep from us.

            "The church, it’s changed. Not like it used to be. I remember Sundays, the little dresses, shoes to match, a purse too. All of it, every Sunday. Private school, friends there, all of us in our best clothes. Now it’s different. They got this thing, a teen mass. Thirty minutes tops. Folks come straight from the beach, clothes still damp, kids running in late. Even the morning services, the ones I used to dress up for, jeans and khakis are the norm. Khakis ain’t bad, I guess, but… casual. That’s the biggest thing, the casualness.\n\nAs for the rest, the politics of it all, that’s not my concern.\n\nThese things with the priests, the accusations.  It ain’t about marriage, not really. Men get married, they still… they still make those choices. It ain’t the church, it’s the man. Hell, there are other churches, ministers and the like, they get to marry, like on that show, “Seventh Heaven.” If a man wants that life, maybe he should look elsewhere.\n\nI think it’s in their blood, those urges.  Genetics, maybe. You can’t teach that, not really. You can try to hide it, try to bury it, but it’ll always come out. The church had no way of knowing, not in every case anyway. If they did know, and they covered it up, then shame on them. But I think sometimes, they were just blind.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of a lie. The words, they rasped in his throat like gravel. September eleventh, a date etched in ash and blood. A pretext, a twisted justification for a war born of shadows and ambition. They’d told the people of a phantom threat, of weapons of mass destruction, of a nexus with the unseen hand of Bin Laden. All of it a smoke screen.  \n\nThe old man, Powell, now spoke of doubt, of a gnawing uncertainty even as he’d thrust the evidence, or what passed for it, before the world. A betrayal, plain as day, a lie laid bare. Malfeasance, he spat. Impeachable, every goddamn fiber of his being screamed it. The Constitution, tattered and trampled beneath the boots of men drunk on power.\n\nThey’d come to office with war in their eyes, a thirst for vengeance inherited from the father’s legacy. Oil, a siren song whispering promises of wealth and dominance, fueled the fire. A blood vengeance, a scorched earth policy, all justified by a hollow echo of freedom.\n\nHe remembered the lake, the stillness of the water reflecting the twilight sky. A birch trunk, hauled from the depths, a testament to industry and need. The scent of damp wood and pine needles, the rhythmic slap of the oars against the water. A memory sharp against the backdrop of this festering wound.\n\nBut the Iraq war, it gnawed at him, a cancer eating away at the soul. A nation fractured, a people divided, a land consumed by the flames of a lie. The withdrawal, a perilous path, fraught with uncertainty. A fractured nation, teetering on the brink of chaos.\n\nThe UN, a shadow puppet show, strings pulled by unseen hands. A coalition of neighbors, a patchwork solution stitched together with wishful thinking. Sovereignty, a word whispered with fear and trembling. The parliament, a house of cards, collapsing under the weight of its own contradictions. A fractured parliament, a fractured nation, a fractured dream.  \n\nAnd he, a witness to it all, a silent observer to the unraveling. The dust settled, a shroud over a nation buried beneath the weight of its own shattered promises.",
            "The air hung thick and silent, a shroud of dust motes dancing in the wan light. He watched the boy, his brow creased in thought, his words tumbling out in a rush, half-formed, searching for purchase in the empty air.  \"It's pointless, this,\" the boy said, his voice a rasp in the stillness. \"Not a real war, not truly. Just… payback.\"\n\nHe knew the boy spoke of the burning, the smoke-filled skies that had marked their lives since they’d left the highway. The ghost of the towers, a wound etched deep in the national memory.  He nodded, a slow, weary movement, eyes fixed on the cracked asphalt before them. \n\n\"We're trying to build something,\" the boy continued, his voice gaining strength, \"a new world, a better world. But it's like trying to build a house on sand. It won't hold.\"\n\nHe looked away, towards the desolate landscape stretching before them, a canvas of bleached bone and ash. A world stripped bare, its veins of oil now a bitter monument to greed. \n\n\"Democracy,\" he muttered, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. \"A fragile thing, built on hope and fear. It takes root slowly, grows slowly, and can be crushed just as easily.\"\n\nThe boy's gaze fell on him, eyes wide and searching.  \"Are we doing the right thing?\" he asked, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nHe looked back at the boy, his face etched with the lines of a thousand unspoken truths. \"Sometimes,\" he said, his voice rough, \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the silence of things unspoken. A chill, deeper than the autumn wind, settled in the marrow. This talk, this push for a law, it felt wrong. Like a hand reaching in from the shadows to pull at the threads of something holy. The Constitution. It was there, plain as day, the separation. A line drawn in the dust, a boundary between the sacred and the secular. To meddle with this, to try and bend it, it was to invite the darkness in. \n\nThese men, these men with their righteous anger, they spoke of what churches believed, of their Bibles and their God. But they were but a single voice, a single choir in the vast cathedral of faith. To choose their song, their law, over the whispers of others, that was tyranny. A godless act, cloaked in the name of righteousness.\n\nAnd what of the amendment? To change the very fabric of the nation, to fold the church into the state, it was a betrayal of the very foundation upon which this country was built. It wasn't to protect the people, no. It was to bind them, to shackle them to the will of the few.\n\nThis was a matter for the cloisters, for the souls to wrestle with, not for the halls of power. Let them preach their damnation, let them live their lives according to their creed. The government had no place in this. \n\nThe whispers of history warned against this path, against this encroachment. The echoes of empires fallen, of freedoms lost, they rang in the silence. We were better than this. We could be better. \n\nLet the churches hold their councils, let the people pray. This was not a battle to be fought in the courts, in the legislatures, but in the quiet spaces of the heart, in the depths of the soul.",
            "The war in Iraq. A stain on the land, a festering wound. It began with lies, they said. Half-truths spun like gossamer threads, designed to catch the heart of a grieving nation. They said it was about those towers, those twisted metal skeletons reaching for a sky choked with ash. But the truth, it simmered below, a slow burn of greed and an echo of ancient battles fought on this sun-baked soil.\n\nI reckon I've never been one for war. Not a man for violence, not a man for the spilling of blood. The taking of life, it leaves a chill that never truly fades. This war, it felt like a fever dream, a bad dream the world couldn't wake from.  A echo of Vietnam, they called it. A slow, grinding machine that chewed up young men and spat them out, broken and empty.\n\nThey say they were going to bring democracy, a balm for a land torn by strife. But what they found was not the welcoming embrace of freedom, but a tangled web of hatred and resentment. They toppled a tyrant, yes, but in his place, a vacuum. A void filled not with hope, but with the ghosts of whispers, the cries of the dispossessed.\n\nThey tried to impose their will on a land with a history older than time itself. They forgot that change, real change, cannot be forced. It must be coaxed, nurtured, like a fragile seedling in the desert. They came with guns and bombs, and they found only fire.\n\nThey said they had to fight for freedom, for the American way of life. But what they saw in those eyes, those weary, haunted eyes, was not freedom. They saw fear, they saw anger, they saw a reflection of their own humanity warped by the smoke and the blood.\n\nNow, years later, the dust still hasn't settled. The scars remain, etched deep into the fabric of that land, a testament to the folly of men who thought they could remake the world in their own image.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of rain and ash. A silence pressed down, heavy as the dust that coated everything.  He spoke, voice rasping like a dry wind through skeletal trees: \"It's a right,\" he said, the word hanging in the air. \"A right like breathing, like the sun.\" He paused, his eyes fixed on some distant horizon only he could see. \"It's in the blood, in the bones.  Not some choice you make.\"\n\nHe knew the world saw it different.  The world saw a battle, a fight.  But for him, it was simpler.  He'd seen love in the eyes of those two men down the street, in the way they held hands, in the quiet comfort of their shared life. It was the same love he'd seen in his own mother's eyes before she died.  The same love that bound him to the boy beside him now. \n\n\"They try to tell us it's wrong,\" he continued, his voice low. \"Try to say it's unnatural. But the Lord, He made the world. He made all things. And He made love, didn't He?  This ain't no sin. This is just life.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy, his young face filled with a wisdom beyond his years.  \"They try to play God,\" he whispered, his gaze hardening. \"But God ain't about taking away. He's about giving. About love.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy again, a fierce protectiveness rising in his chest. \"And we'll keep giving it,\" he said. \"We'll keep loving. We'll keep fighting for what's right. 'Cause in the end, that's all that matters.\"",
            "The boy’s words hung in the air, a dry rustle of leaves in the wind.  \"When you put something on the internet,” he said, his voice thin as a breaking twig, “it’s… public.”  He paused, searching for the right word. “It’s completely public.”  \n\nThe man watched him, a slow smoke curling from his lips, the light of the dying fire casting his face in shadow. “You can’t,” he said, his voice a low rumble, “unspeak what’s been spoken.”\n\nThe boy’s eyes, wide and shadowed, looked up at him. “I mean, as an R.A., I’ve seen it. You put something out there, it colors people’s thoughts. If you’re talkin’ ‘bout blowin' things up, or shootings…” He trailed off, the fear in his voice palpable.\n\n“Someone’s gonna say somethin’. You can’t put that out there. The internet,” he spat the word out like a curse, “it’s seen by everyone. If you’re friends with someone on Myspace, you get their bulletin. The school didn’t get it from the school. Someone went to the school. They had to act.” He gestured with his hand, a hollow, empty movement.\n\n“They can’t let it sit, God forbid somethin’ happens, they coulda prevented it.”\n\nThe boy nodded, his face pale in the flickering light. “But,” he said, his voice barely a whisper, “you don’t know what to take seriously. Some folks just fool around like that. It could be…” He searched for the words, his brow furrowed. “It could be like that time at school. An experiment gone wrong.”\n\nThe man sighed, the smoke curling upwards. “For a sociology class, or somethin’.”\n\n“And it could also be something real serious,” the boy continued, his voice gaining a sliver of strength. “The thing is, what happened here, someone overheard somethin’ and told the school. Then they checked his Facebook, his friend did, and they saw things, things that might have been a joke, but in light of what happened, became real serious.” \n\nHe looked up at the man, his eyes pleading. “When you put stuff out there, on the internet, there ain’t no privacy. If you don’t want it out there, don’t put it there. If you don’t want people to see it, to think somethin’ of you, you can’t tell them what to think.” He paused, his voice weary. “You can’t tell people what to take seriously or not.”\n\nThe man smoked in silence for a long moment, his gaze fixed on the dying embers.",
            "The war. Drawn out. Too long. Like a fevered dream that won't break.  It began with good intentions, maybe. To right a wrong, to bring light to a darkened place. Democracy, they called it. A fair hand for the people. But the light, it seemed to flicker.  Lost in the smoke and dust.\n\nNow, it feels like something else. A need to prove. To show who's strong. A shadow of old scores settled in the ashes.  The father's whisper, a grudge carried on the wind.\n\nDemocracy, a faded banner.  A justification worn thin. We struck a blow, a quick spark of fire. But the flames, they didn't die.  They smoldered. They crept. The years stretched on, a long, lean shadow. \n\nThe cost, it mounts. Dollars bled into the earth, a river of red.  Our own wounds fester, ignored. Poverty, a hungry beast, gnaws at the edges of our nation. It cries out, but the drums of war drown out its voice.\n\nHow long can we keep this up?  How many sons and daughters must be lost before the echoes of purpose fade away?  They say there must be a victory. A clean break. But what victory is there in a land turned to ash?\n\nThe time has come for us to look back.  To see the faces of the lost, the tears of the weeping mothers. To hear the whisper of the wind through the empty husks of buildings.  It's time to walk away. To heal the wounds, both our own and theirs.  The war has served its purpose. It's time to let it die.",
            "The day bled into the next, the rain a shroud over the world.  He sat across the table from the boy, the cracked plastic surface slick with condensation. The boy shifted, fiddling with the frayed edge of his worn sweater. The silence stretched, thick and heavy as the air. Finally, the boy spoke, his voice a whisper against the hum of the dying storm. \"Can I ask you something?\" \n\nHe looked at the boy, his face drawn and weary. \"Sure, son. What is it?\"\n\n\"About that, uh, about what happened.\" \n\nHe reached out, his hand resting on the boy's shoulder, a gesture both comforting and sorrowful. \"What about it?\" \n\nThe boy hesitated, his eyes downcast. \"Is it, is it bad that someone found out?\"\n\nHe sighed, the sound rasping in his chest. \"Bad?  It depends. What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Like, on Myspace. If someone sees something, can they, can they stop it?\"\n\n\"Stop what?\" \n\n\"You know,\" the boy mumbled, his gaze fixed on the damp table. \"If someone's gonna do something bad, if they say it online.\"\n\nHe reached for the cup of lukewarm coffee, the metal bitter against his tongue. \"The world is full of shadows, son.  Things whispered in the dark. Sometimes those whispers are heard. Sometimes they're not.\"\n\nThe boy looked up, his eyes wide and searching. \"But if someone hears them, can they stop it? Can they make it go away?\"\n\n\"That depends,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly. \"Depends on if they have the will.  Depends if they're willing to face the darkness.\"\n\nThe boy fell silent, the weight of his question hanging in the air.  The rain continued its relentless drumming, a mournful counterpoint to their unspoken conversation.  He knew the boy was too young to understand the complexities of the world. The shadows that lurked beneath the surface, the unspoken truths that festered in the human heart.  But he also knew that the boy was more perceptive than he let on, his young mind already grappling with questions that would haunt him for years to come.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the words catching in his throat like ash.  He shifted, the plastic of the chair scraping against the worn linoleum.  *Hypocritical*, he thought, the word a bitter taste on his tongue.  \"Hate to be part of the chorus,\" he mumbled, \"the ones who just say 'I told you so.'\"  He knew the feeling, the punch of certainty that came with hindsight, the ease of joining the throng.  But it wasn't about that now.\n\nHe looked out the window, the glass smeared with dust and the cityscape beyond a hazy smudge of gray.  The city, a monument to broken promises and shattered dreams.  He thought of the polls, the numbers echoing in the hollow chambers of his mind: seventy-five percent, eighty percent, a sea of dissent against the tide of folly.  Iraqis, Americans, the world itself, all chanting the same refrain: *It was a mistake.*  He remembered the troops, their faces grim, their words echoing his own: *A dumb idea, pull out now.*  He saw the faces of the dead, the ghosts of a war that never should have been fought.\n\nHe spoke of culture clashes, of the gulf between worlds, the arrogance of imposing an alien order.  He thought of Saddam, a monster, yes, but a monster whose removal had unleashed a new and deeper darkness.  He thought of the quicksand, the endless struggle, the futility of it all.  \n\nHis voice trailed off, a sigh lost in the silence.  He didn't have the answers.  He didn't know how to untangle this knot, this mess of blood and ashes.  But he knew one thing: staying wasn't the answer.  The Iraqi people, the ones they claimed to save, yearned for freedom, for an end to the occupation.  Their voices, though muted by fear, still cried out for peace.\n\nHe thought of the statistics, the eighty percent who wanted to be free.  *Maybe they knew better,* he thought, *maybe they knew the cost of our presence more than we ever could.* He saw the faces of the dead, the ghosts of a war that never should have been fought.",
            "The air hung thick with it, this ache of inequality.  Not just for the women, though they bore the brunt, it seemed.  It seeped into the marrow of any man who dared to stray from the path.  The glass ceiling, they called it, though the truth was, it was more like a shroud, a weight pressing down on aspirations.  You could see it, that place on the other side, the place where power resided, but never quite reach it.  The men who defied it, who dared to stay home with their children, they met with scorn, whispers of weakness clinging to them like smoke.  And the men who dared to find beauty in the needle and thread, in the silken whispers of fabric, they were met with doubt, their passion dismissed as frivolous, a divergence from the \"real\" man's course.\n\nThe world, it clung to its patterns, to the worn grooves of expectation.  But change, it crept like a slow river, carving its own path through the stone.  The women climbing the ladder, the men choosing family over paycheck, the artists finding their voice in the margins.  It was a hard fight, a slow burn, but the embers were glowing.  Change would come, it had to.  The question was, would it come soon enough?\n\nThe past, it was a ghost, a shadow stretching across the present, tainting the air.  But the future, that was a canvas, a blank slate waiting for the strokes of a new dawn.  And maybe, just maybe, those strokes would be bold, defiant, and free.",
            "The air hung thick and stagnant. The words stumbled out, halting, uncertain. \"Decriminalized,\" he said, tasting the word like ash. \"Not legalized. Knocked down from a crime, to... a ticket.\" He paused, searching for the right weight, the right shade of gray to paint the picture. \"Like forgetting something important, but the memory still aches.\"\n\nHe went on, voice a low rasp, \"Future ramifications. They linger. Like ghosts in the hollow places.\" He looked out, past the smoke-filled room, at the blank faces of the unseen interviewers.  \"The cost,\" he continued, \"of hauling them in, the courtrooms filled with the echoes of accusations, the endless paperwork. It bleeds the towns dry.\"\n\nHe saw their faces shift, a flicker of understanding, of shared cost. \"Denver,\" he said, the name a whisper of hope, \"they embraced it. Freed the money for schools, for the hungry, for the forgotten. The streets, they said, weren't paved with lies, just with the weight of forgotten dreams.\"\n\nHis voice dropped lower, \"But the open air, the smoke curling into the wind… it's a whisper, a shadow. It hangs there, a question mark. Not everyone welcomes it. Some fight it, still.\"\n\nHe spoke of the awkwardness, the discomfort, the lingering stigma. \"Like a stain on the soul,\" he murmured, \"a secret kept too long.\" He looked at them, eyes hard, \"But the truth is...it's a seed already sown. It grows in the silence, in the shadows. It waits for the right moment to bloom.\"\n\nHe paused, letting the silence hang heavy, \"They both have their price. Alcohol, a slow poison. Marijuana, a veil over the heart.\" He sighed, \"It's a dance with darkness, isn't it? Each step a choice, each consequence a lesson.\"",
            "The man spoke, his voice a rasp against the silence. \"Yes, I would say yes.\"  A pause, a drawl, the kind that stretched and thinned the air. \n\n\"Because...\" he began, then faltered.  \"These traditions, they're like roots sunk deep. They've held fast for a time, and that's something to reckon with. But the world, it shifts.  The wind changes course.  A tree needs to bend, or it breaks.\"\n\nHe paused, eyes distant, as if seeing something beyond the words.  \"They say there's a way, a right way.  Go to church every Sunday, kneel, pray, confess.  Believe as they say, live as they say. But what of the heart that bleeds a different truth? What of the soul that wanders in the shadows?\"\n\nHis voice dropped, a low murmur.  \"They judge, you see.  Don't take kindly to the different.  My father, he was an Episcopalian. My mother, Catholic.  They wouldn't let them wed.  Said it was against God's law.\"\n\nHe chuckled, a bitter sound. \"Love others, they preach.  Yet turn away those who aren't like them. A hollow echo, that.  Hypocrisy draped in holy robes.\"\n\n\"Devout, they are. Rigid.  Stuck in the ways.  Outdated, some might say.\"  A sigh, heavy and mournful.  \"They cling to the old stories, the old ways. But the world, it keeps moving.  And sometimes, the stories need to change.\"\n\nHe looked up, eyes searching, as if seeking answers in the empty space.\n\n\"No,\" he said finally.  \"They'd still find a way.\"\n\nHe shook his head, a slow, weary movement.  \"It's not the marriage that corrupts.  It's the darkness in the heart.  A shadow that darkens no matter the light.\"",
            "The matter weighs heavy. A knot in the gut. Right and wrong, blurred lines. This thing we wrestle with, the bleed of church and state, the definition of marriage, it cuts deep.  Like a bone saw splitting the marrow clean.  How do you speak of such things without waking the ghosts?  How do you thread the needle of tolerance without losing the thread altogether?\n\nMarriage, a sacrament, a covenant.  Some see it in the eyes of God. Others in the cold, hard steel of law.  Tax breaks, legal protections, the weight of the state upon the vows.  Baptism, a silent promise whispered in the dark.  But the state does not barge in on that, does it?  No, it leaves that to the unseen.\n\nSo what then? Civil union, a handshake, a contract. Two souls bound, two lives intertwined.  The government, a silent witness, a recorder. No need for judgment, just recognition.  Let them bind themselves, let them bear witness to each other's lives.  Let the church do its work in the shadows.\n\nThis is the crux, the heart of the quandary. A line drawn in the dust, shifting with every breath.  A nation divided, a nation searching. \n\nIf the states can find common ground, perhaps then the whole will follow.  But to amend the Constitution, to write darkness into the very fabric of the land, that is a dangerous game.  To ban a love, to etch it in stone, a stain on the soul of the nation. \n\nIt is a matter of weight, of consequence.  A matter that demands more than a careless brushstroke.  It demands a heart, a soul, a touch of grace.",
            "The boy's words hung in the air, a tremor in the silence. \"Homosexuality,\" he'd said, the word tasting strange, unfamiliar on his tongue. The man stared out at the dusty road stretching before them, the sun a bleached bone in the sky.  He knew the boy was looking at him, waiting for an answer, but the words felt like stones lodged in his throat.\n\nHe'd been raised in the church, bathed in the hymns and sermons of a God who seemed to offer only judgment and a narrow path. But the boy, innocent in his questions, had unearthed something deeper, something that had always lingered in the shadows. A question of freedom, of choice, a choice that seemed to cut against the grain of his upbringing.\n\nHe thought of his friends, the ones who lived lives different from his own, who loved beyond the lines drawn by the scriptures. He saw their faces, heard their laughter, felt the warmth of their acceptance. Could he deny their humanity, their right to love?\n\nThe answer came to him, slow and hard, like the grinding of rock against rock. It wasn't about agreement, not about condoning or condemning. It was about respect. About the right of each soul to find its own path, its own truth. It was about the freedom to choose, to love, to live.\n\n\"It's a matter for each state,\" he finally said, his voice rough with the unspoke words. \"Each place has its own way, its own story.\" \n\n\nHe looked at the boy, at the hope and confusion in his eyes. \"We can't force our beliefs on others,\" he said, \"but we can offer understanding. We can learn to live together, even when our paths diverge.\"",
            "The air hung thick and gray, the silence broken only by the rasp of his own breath. He stared at the screen, the words flickering like dying embers in the dim light. \"Myspace is a public thing,\" he mumbled, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. \"A bulletin board.\"  He paused, the knot in his chest tightening.  \"If you post something there, you have to know.\"  He swallowed hard, the taste of fear bitter on his tongue. \"People will see it.  School officials, anyone.\" \n\nHe remembered the old man's words, spoken in the twilight years, \"The world is a hard place, son.  The things you put into your head, they stay there. You forget what you want to remember, and you remember what you want to forget.\" He ran a calloused hand through his hair, the words echoing in the silence.  \n\n Was it wrong then, to protect the flock? To sift through the digital debris, searching for the whispers of danger before they turned into screams? Did they have a right, the guardians of the young, to peer into the corners of the internet, to see what lurked in the shadows?\n\nHe felt a cold hand grip his heart.  \"But what about privacy?\" he whispered, the question hanging heavy in the air.  The words seemed to dissolve into the dust motes dancing in the pale light.  \n\nHe thought of his own childhood, of the bare wood walls of his uncle's farmhouse, the smell of woodsmoke and damp earth, the endless silence broken only by the rustling leaves and the distant caw of a crow. He remembered the day he'd found his uncle's prized hunting rifle, hidden beneath the floorboards. The cold steel in his hand, the weight of it, the knowledge that it could take a life. \n\nHe'd kept that secret buried deep inside, a darkness he didn't dare share. But sometimes, in the dead of night, he'd wake up, the memory sharp and cold, the echo of the rifle's roar ringing in his ears.\n\nHe looked back at the screen. The words swam before his eyes, a blur of doubt and fear.  \"Maybe,\" he said finally, his voice a raspy whisper.  \"Maybe sometimes, the line between right and wrong is just a shadow.\"",
            "The war. A hot iron pressed to the gut. Nine Eleven. A wound raw and bleeding still. At first, the blood turned to rage.  It felt right, that fire. To go over there and lick the flames of their hate. But the fire choked, turned to ash. Now the bones of that rage ache.  We went in blind, fists clenched, hearts hammering. Like children with matches, not knowing the kindling would burn the whole damn forest. Didn't think of the smoke, the long aftermath, the way it would stain everything.\n\nThey fight themselves, those people. A sickness in their blood, a hunger that consumes. What good is our fire against such a thing? We went in to set them right, but the mirror showed back our own darkness.  \n\nThey’re not like us. Not human. Not anymore.  \n\nWe should have stayed home. Should have let the smoke rise and settle, let the dust fall like the slow decay of bone. But the fire took hold, and now it burns a hole in our souls. We went for revenge, they say. For justice. But all we found was more ashes."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, it needs changing. Her views, they're set in stone, some of them. Like a granite altar, unyielding. And folks, they're leaving. The flock is thinning. They say it's because the Church, she ain't accepting enough. Not of the times, not of the heart's desires.  She clings to these old ways, these pronouncements against what some call love, against choice, against the flesh.  \n\nThey talk about gay marriage, about abortion, about the use of birth control. These are matters of the soul, of the body, of the way the world unfolds. And the Church, she judges, she condemns.  But folks, they're tired of judgement. They want understanding, they want compassion. \n\nThink of it this way: A child comes to the well, thirsty. But the Church offers only dust.  They need a different kind of water, a deeper well.  They need a Church that reflects the world, not dictates it.\n\nThey say the Church’s stance on these things, it's driving people away. They feel the weight of her condemnation, the chill of her disapproval. And they wander, seeking solace elsewhere. \n\nA young man, he wants to love another man.  The Church says no. A woman, she wants control over her own body. The Church says no.  A couple, they need protection, they plan their children. The Church says no. And they turn away, seeking a haven of acceptance. \n\nThe Church, she's a grand edifice, built on the shoulders of centuries. But her foundation is cracking.  The wind howls through the cracks, carrying whispers of change.  And the people, they're listening. They're wondering, is there room for them, here?",
            "The boy sat there, silence a shroud around him.  He spoke, his voice thin as a whisper in the dry air.  \"Do you think it's right?\"  \n\nThe man squinted at the road, the gray dust motes dancing in the weak light. \"Right?\"  He turned the word over in his mouth, tasting its emptiness. \"What's right anymore, boy? In this world?\"\n\n\"Marriage,\" the boy said, his eyes fixed on the man's face. \"Two men. Or two women. Is that right?\"\n\nThe man looked at the boy, his silence a heavy thing.  He thought of the road stretching ahead, endless and unforgiving, of the ash-choked sky, of the silence that stretched deeper than any canyon.  He thought of the days gone by, of the things he'd seen, the things he'd done, the things he'd lost.  And in the face of all that, the boy's question felt small, insignificant, yet it held a weight that pressed down on him.\n\n\"The world,\" he said finally, his voice rasping, \"the world's gone mad.  It forgets what it used to know.  It forgets what it means to be human.\" He looked back at the boy, his gaze searching. \"But some things,\" he said, \"some things are as old as the hills.  Love.  Loss.  The need to be seen, to be heard.  Maybe,\" he added, his voice barely a whisper, \"maybe that's all that matters.\" \n\nHe didn't say if it was right or wrong.  He didn't have the answers.

            "The road stretched out before him, gray and cracked, a scar across the face of ash. The boy walked beside him, small and thin, his eyes fixed on the ground. They were headed south, driven by a hunger deeper than for food. A hunger for something whole, something salvaged from the wreckage.\n\n\"Why do they say it's wrong?\" the boy asked, his voice barely a whisper against the wind.\n\nThe man looked at him, the boy's face pale and etched with a weariness beyond his years.  \"They say things they don't understand,\" he rasped, his voice dry as dust. \"They fear what they don't know. They cling to shadows.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence between them thick with unspoken truths.  The sun, a pale disc in the smoky sky, cast long, skeletal shadows that danced around them.  They were on the move, always on the move, searching for something they couldn't name.\n\n\"But it's just love, isn't it?\" the boy persisted, his voice trembling. \n\nThe man stopped, pulling a battered photograph from his pocket. It was faded and worn, the edges softened with time. A younger version of himself stared back, a smile creased on his face. Beside him, a woman, her eyes bright with laughter.  The man's throat tightened, the memory a shard of glass in his chest.\n\n\"It's everything,\" he murmured, his voice rough with emotion. \"It's the only thing that matters.\"\n\nThey continued their journey, two solitary figures against the desolate landscape. The wind whispered through the skeletal trees, a mournful dirge for a world lost. They walked on, driven by the faint flicker of hope, the promise of something better, something truer, something worth fighting for.",

They say it rots the mind.\"\n\nThe man, his face worn and shadowed, looked down at him. \"They say a lot of things, boy.  Things that ain't always true.  Just because a thing is outlawed doesn't mean it's poison.  There's good in the world, and there's bad.  It's in the using, boy, not the thing itself.  You see the way they lock away the good things, the things that heal?  They fear what they don't understand.\"\n\nHe paused, his gaze drifting to a dusty vial on the shelf.  \"They lock away the things that ease the pain, the things that quiet the mind.  They keep them hidden, out of reach. But the boy, he saw the truth.  He saw the green leaves, the way they calmed the fevered brow, the way they lifted the weight of the world.  He saw the stories his grandfather told, the tales of ancient cures, of whispered remedies passed down through generations.\"\n\n\"There are things in this world,\" he said, his voice low, \"that the powerful want to keep from us.

            "The church, it’s changed. Not like it used to be. I remember Sundays, the little dresses, shoes to match, a purse too. All of it, every Sunday. Private school, friends there, all of us in our best clothes. Now it’s different. They got this thing, a teen mass. Thirty minutes tops. Folks come straight from the beach, clothes still damp, kids running in late. Even the morning services, the ones I used to dress up for, jeans and khakis are the norm. Khakis ain’t bad, I guess, but… casual. That’s the biggest thing, the casualness.\n\nAs for the rest, the politics of it all, that’s not my concern.\n\nThese things with the priests, the accusations.  It ain’t about marriage, not really. Men get married, they still… they still make those choices. It ain’t the church, it’s the man. Hell, there are other churches, ministers and the like, they get to marry, like on that show, “Seventh Heaven.” If a man wants that life, maybe he should look elsewhere.\n\nI think it’s in their blood, those urges.  Genetics, maybe. You can’t teach that, not really. You can try to hide it, try to bury it, but it’ll always come out. The church had no way of knowing, not in every case anyway. If they did know, and they covered it up, then shame on them. But I think sometimes, they were just blind.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of a lie. The words, they rasped in his throat like gravel. September eleventh, a date etched in ash and blood. A pretext, a twisted justification for a war born of shadows and ambition. They’d told the people of a phantom threat, of weapons of mass destruction, of a nexus with the unseen hand of Bin Laden. All of it a smoke screen.  \n\nThe old man, Powell, now spoke of doubt, of a gnawing uncertainty even as he’d thrust the evidence, or what passed for it, before the world. A betrayal, plain as day, a lie laid bare. Malfeasance, he spat. Impeachable, every goddamn fiber of his being screamed it. The Constitution, tattered and trampled beneath the boots of men drunk on power.\n\nThey’d come to office with war in their eyes, a thirst for vengeance inherited from the father’s legacy. Oil, a siren song whispering promises of wealth and dominance, fueled the fire. A blood vengeance, a scorched earth policy, all justified by a hollow echo of freedom.\n\nHe remembered the lake, the stillness of the water reflecting the twilight sky. A birch trunk, hauled from the depths, a testament to industry and need. The scent of damp wood and pine needles, the rhythmic slap of the oars against the water. A memory sharp against the backdrop of this festering wound.\n\nBut the Iraq war, it gnawed at him, a cancer eating away at the soul. A nation fractured, a people divided, a land consumed by the flames of a lie. The withdrawal, a perilous path, fraught with uncertainty. A fractured nation, teetering on the brink of chaos.\n\nThe UN, a shadow puppet show, strings pulled by unseen hands. A coalition of neighbors, a patchwork solution stitched together with wishful thinking. Sovereignty, a word whispered with fear and trembling. The parliament, a house of cards, collapsing under the weight of its own contradictions. A fractured parliament, a fractured nation, a fractured dream.  \n\nAnd he, a witness to it all, a silent observer to the unraveling. The dust settled, a shroud over a nation buried beneath the weight of its own shattered promises.",
            "The air hung thick and silent, a shroud of dust motes dancing in the wan light. He watched the boy, his brow creased in thought, his words tumbling out in a rush, half-formed, searching for purchase in the empty air.  \"It's pointless, this,\" the boy said, his voice a rasp in the stillness. \"Not a real war, not truly. Just… payback.\"\n\nHe knew the boy spoke of the burning, the smoke-filled skies that had marked their lives since they’d left the highway. The ghost of the towers, a wound etched deep in the national memory.  He nodded, a slow, weary movement, eyes fixed on the cracked asphalt before them. \n\n\"We're trying to build something,\" the boy continued, his voice gaining strength, \"a new world, a better world. But it's like trying to build a house on sand. It won't hold.\"\n\nHe looked away, towards the desolate landscape stretching before them, a canvas of bleached bone and ash. A world stripped bare, its veins of oil now a bitter monument to greed. \n\n\"Democracy,\" he muttered, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. \"A fragile thing, built on hope and fear. It takes root slowly, grows slowly, and can be crushed just as easily.\"\n\nThe boy's gaze fell on him, eyes wide and searching.  \"Are we doing the right thing?\" he asked, his voice barely a whisper.\n\nHe looked back at the boy, his face etched with the lines of a thousand unspoken truths. \"Sometimes,\" he said, his voice rough, \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the silence of things unspoken. A chill, deeper than the autumn wind, settled in the marrow. This talk, this push for a law, it felt wrong. Like a hand reaching in from the shadows to pull at the threads of something holy. The Constitution. It was there, plain as day, the separation. A line drawn in the dust, a boundary between the sacred and the secular. To meddle with this, to try and bend it, it was to invite the darkness in. \n\nThese men, these men with their righteous anger, they spoke of what churches believed, of their Bibles and their God. But they were but a single voice, a single choir in the vast cathedral of faith. To choose their song, their law, over the whispers of others, that was tyranny. A godless act, cloaked in the name of righteousness.\n\nAnd what of the amendment? To change the very fabric of the nation, to fold the church into the state, it was a betrayal of the very foundation upon which this country was built. It wasn't to protect the people, no. It was to bind them, to shackle them to the will of the few.\n\nThis was a matter for the cloisters, for the souls to wrestle with, not for the halls of power. Let them preach their damnation, let them live their lives according to their creed. The government had no place in this. \n\nThe whispers of history warned against this path, against this encroachment. The echoes of empires fallen, of freedoms lost, they rang in the silence. We were better than this. We could be better. \n\nLet the churches hold their councils, let the people pray. This was not a battle to be fought in the courts, in the legislatures, but in the quiet spaces of the heart, in the depths of the soul.",
            "The war in Iraq. A stain on the land, a festering wound. It began with lies, they said. Half-truths spun like gossamer threads, designed to catch the heart of a grieving nation. They said it was about those towers, those twisted metal skeletons reaching for a sky choked with ash. But the truth, it simmered below, a slow burn of greed and an echo of ancient battles fought on this sun-baked soil.\n\nI reckon I've never been one for war. Not a man for violence, not a man for the spilling of blood. The taking of life, it leaves a chill that never truly fades. This war, it felt like a fever dream, a bad dream the world couldn't wake from.  A echo of Vietnam, they called it. A slow, grinding machine that chewed up young men and spat them out, broken and empty.\n\nThey say they were going to bring democracy, a balm for a land torn by strife. But what they found was not the welcoming embrace of freedom, but a tangled web of hatred and resentment. They toppled a tyrant, yes, but in his place, a vacuum. A void filled not with hope, but with the ghosts of whispers, the cries of the dispossessed.\n\nThey tried to impose their will on a land with a history older than time itself. They forgot that change, real change, cannot be forced. It must be coaxed, nurtured, like a fragile seedling in the desert. They came with guns and bombs, and they found only fire.\n\nThey said they had to fight for freedom, for the American way of life. But what they saw in those eyes, those weary, haunted eyes, was not freedom. They saw fear, they saw anger, they saw a reflection of their own humanity warped by the smoke and the blood.\n\nNow, years later, the dust still hasn't settled. The scars remain, etched deep into the fabric of that land, a testament to the folly of men who thought they could remake the world in their own image.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of rain and ash. A silence pressed down, heavy as the dust that coated everything.  He spoke, voice rasping like a dry wind through skeletal trees: \"It's a right,\" he said, the word hanging in the air. \"A right like breathing, like the sun.\" He paused, his eyes fixed on some distant horizon only he could see. \"It's in the blood, in the bones.  Not some choice you make.\"\n\nHe knew the world saw it different.  The world saw a battle, a fight.  But for him, it was simpler.  He'd seen love in the eyes of those two men down the street, in the way they held hands, in the quiet comfort of their shared life. It was the same love he'd seen in his own mother's eyes before she died.  The same love that bound him to the boy beside him now. \n\n\"They try to tell us it's wrong,\" he continued, his voice low. \"Try to say it's unnatural. But the Lord, He made the world. He made all things. And He made love, didn't He?  This ain't no sin. This is just life.\"\n\nHe thought of the boy, his young face filled with a wisdom beyond his years.  \"They try to play God,\" he whispered, his gaze hardening. \"But God ain't about taking away. He's about giving. About love.\"\n\nHe looked at the boy again, a fierce protectiveness rising in his chest. \"And we'll keep giving it,\" he said. \"We'll keep loving. We'll keep fighting for what's right. 'Cause in the end, that's all that matters.\"",
            "The boy’s words hung in the air, a dry rustle of leaves in the wind.  \"When you put something on the internet,” he said, his voice thin as a breaking twig, “it’s… public.”  He paused, searching for the right word. “It’s completely public.”  \n\nThe man watched him, a slow smoke curling from his lips, the light of the dying fire casting his face in shadow. “You can’t,” he said, his voice a low rumble, “unspeak what’s been spoken.”\n\nThe boy’s eyes, wide and shadowed, looked up at him. “I mean, as an R.A., I’ve seen it. You put something out there, it colors people’s thoughts. If you’re talkin’ ‘bout blowin' things up, or shootings…” He trailed off, the fear in his voice palpable.\n\n“Someone’s gonna say somethin’. You can’t put that out there. The internet,” he spat the word out like a curse, “it’s seen by everyone. If you’re friends with someone on Myspace, you get their bulletin. The school didn’t get it from the school. Someone went to the school. They had to act.” He gestured with his hand, a hollow, empty movement.\n\n“They can’t let it sit, God forbid somethin’ happens, they coulda prevented it.”\n\nThe boy nodded, his face pale in the flickering light. “But,” he said, his voice barely a whisper, “you don’t know what to take seriously. Some folks just fool around like that. It could be…” He searched for the words, his brow furrowed. “It could be like that time at school. An experiment gone wrong.”\n\nThe man sighed, the smoke curling upwards. “For a sociology class, or somethin’.”\n\n“And it could also be something real serious,” the boy continued, his voice gaining a sliver of strength. “The thing is, what happened here, someone overheard somethin’ and told the school. Then they checked his Facebook, his friend did, and they saw things, things that might have been a joke, but in light of what happened, became real serious.” \n\nHe looked up at the man, his eyes pleading. “When you put stuff out there, on the internet, there ain’t no privacy. If you don’t want it out there, don’t put it there. If you don’t want people to see it, to think somethin’ of you, you can’t tell them what to think.” He paused, his voice weary. “You can’t tell people what to take seriously or not.”\n\nThe man smoked in silence for a long moment, his gaze fixed on the dying embers.",
            "The war. Drawn out. Too long. Like a fevered dream that won't break.  It began with good intentions, maybe. To right a wrong, to bring light to a darkened place. Democracy, they called it. A fair hand for the people. But the light, it seemed to flicker.  Lost in the smoke and dust.\n\nNow, it feels like something else. A need to prove. To show who's strong. A shadow of old scores settled in the ashes.  The father's whisper, a grudge carried on the wind.\n\nDemocracy, a faded banner.  A justification worn thin. We struck a blow, a quick spark of fire. But the flames, they didn't die.  They smoldered. They crept. The years stretched on, a long, lean shadow. \n\nThe cost, it mounts. Dollars bled into the earth, a river of red.  Our own wounds fester, ignored. Poverty, a hungry beast, gnaws at the edges of our nation. It cries out, but the drums of war drown out its voice.\n\nHow long can we keep this up?  How many sons and daughters must be lost before the echoes of purpose fade away?  They say there must be a victory. A clean break. But what victory is there in a land turned to ash?\n\nThe time has come for us to look back.  To see the faces of the lost, the tears of the weeping mothers. To hear the whisper of the wind through the empty husks of buildings.  It's time to walk away. To heal the wounds, both our own and theirs.  The war has served its purpose. It's time to let it die.",
            "The day bled into the next, the rain a shroud over the world.  He sat across the table from the boy, the cracked plastic surface slick with condensation. The boy shifted, fiddling with the frayed edge of his worn sweater. The silence stretched, thick and heavy as the air. Finally, the boy spoke, his voice a whisper against the hum of the dying storm. \"Can I ask you something?\" \n\nHe looked at the boy, his face drawn and weary. \"Sure, son. What is it?\"\n\n\"About that, uh, about what happened.\" \n\nHe reached out, his hand resting on the boy's shoulder, a gesture both comforting and sorrowful. \"What about it?\" \n\nThe boy hesitated, his eyes downcast. \"Is it, is it bad that someone found out?\"\n\nHe sighed, the sound rasping in his chest. \"Bad?  It depends. What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Like, on Myspace. If someone sees something, can they, can they stop it?\"\n\n\"Stop what?\" \n\n\"You know,\" the boy mumbled, his gaze fixed on the damp table. \"If someone's gonna do something bad, if they say it online.\"\n\nHe reached for the cup of lukewarm coffee, the metal bitter against his tongue. \"The world is full of shadows, son.  Things whispered in the dark. Sometimes those whispers are heard. Sometimes they're not.\"\n\nThe boy looked up, his eyes wide and searching. \"But if someone hears them, can they stop it? Can they make it go away?\"\n\n\"That depends,\" he said, his voice low and gravelly. \"Depends on if they have the will.  Depends if they're willing to face the darkness.\"\n\nThe boy fell silent, the weight of his question hanging in the air.  The rain continued its relentless drumming, a mournful counterpoint to their unspoken conversation.  He knew the boy was too young to understand the complexities of the world. The shadows that lurked beneath the surface, the unspoken truths that festered in the human heart.  But he also knew that the boy was more perceptive than he let on, his young mind already grappling with questions that would haunt him for years to come.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the words catching in his throat like ash.  He shifted, the plastic of the chair scraping against the worn linoleum.  *Hypocritical*, he thought, the word a bitter taste on his tongue.  \"Hate to be part of the chorus,\" he mumbled, \"the ones who just say 'I told you so.'\"  He knew the feeling, the punch of certainty that came with hindsight, the ease of joining the throng.  But it wasn't about that now.\n\nHe looked out the window, the glass smeared with dust and the cityscape beyond a hazy smudge of gray.  The city, a monument to broken promises and shattered dreams.  He thought of the polls, the numbers echoing in the hollow chambers of his mind: seventy-five percent, eighty percent, a sea of dissent against the tide of folly.  Iraqis, Americans, the world itself, all chanting the same refrain: *It was a mistake.*  He remembered the troops, their faces grim, their words echoing his own: *A dumb idea, pull out now.*  He saw the faces of the dead, the ghosts of a war that never should have been fought.\n\nHe spoke of culture clashes, of the gulf between worlds, the arrogance of imposing an alien order.  He thought of Saddam, a monster, yes, but a monster whose removal had unleashed a new and deeper darkness.  He thought of the quicksand, the endless struggle, the futility of it all.  \n\nHis voice trailed off, a sigh lost in the silence.  He didn't have the answers.  He didn't know how to untangle this knot, this mess of blood and ashes.  But he knew one thing: staying wasn't the answer.  The Iraqi people, the ones they claimed to save, yearned for freedom, for an end to the occupation.  Their voices, though muted by fear, still cried out for peace.\n\nHe thought of the statistics, the eighty percent who wanted to be free.  *Maybe they knew better,* he thought, *maybe they knew the cost of our presence more than we ever could.* He saw the faces of the dead, the ghosts of a war that never should have been fought.",
            "The air hung thick with it, this ache of inequality.  Not just for the women, though they bore the brunt, it seemed.  It seeped into the marrow of any man who dared to stray from the path.  The glass ceiling, they called it, though the truth was, it was more like a shroud, a weight pressing down on aspirations.  You could see it, that place on the other side, the place where power resided, but never quite reach it.  The men who defied it, who dared to stay home with their children, they met with scorn, whispers of weakness clinging to them like smoke.  And the men who dared to find beauty in the needle and thread, in the silken whispers of fabric, they were met with doubt, their passion dismissed as frivolous, a divergence from the \"real\" man's course.\n\nThe world, it clung to its patterns, to the worn grooves of expectation.  But change, it crept like a slow river, carving its own path through the stone.  The women climbing the ladder, the men choosing family over paycheck, the artists finding their voice in the margins.  It was a hard fight, a slow burn, but the embers were glowing.  Change would come, it had to.  The question was, would it come soon enough?\n\nThe past, it was a ghost, a shadow stretching across the present, tainting the air.  But the future, that was a canvas, a blank slate waiting for the strokes of a new dawn.  And maybe, just maybe, those strokes would be bold, defiant, and free.",
            "The air hung thick and stagnant. The words stumbled out, halting, uncertain. \"Decriminalized,\" he said, tasting the word like ash. \"Not legalized. Knocked down from a crime, to... a ticket.\" He paused, searching for the right weight, the right shade of gray to paint the picture. \"Like forgetting something important, but the memory still aches.\"\n\nHe went on, voice a low rasp, \"Future ramifications. They linger. Like ghosts in the hollow places.\" He looked out, past the smoke-filled room, at the blank faces of the unseen interviewers.  \"The cost,\" he continued, \"of hauling them in, the courtrooms filled with the echoes of accusations, the endless paperwork. It bleeds the towns dry.\"\n\nHe saw their faces shift, a flicker of understanding, of shared cost. \"Denver,\" he said, the name a whisper of hope, \"they embraced it. Freed the money for schools, for the hungry, for the forgotten. The streets, they said, weren't paved with lies, just with the weight of forgotten dreams.\"\n\nHis voice dropped lower, \"But the open air, the smoke curling into the wind… it's a whisper, a shadow. It hangs there, a question mark. Not everyone welcomes it. Some fight it, still.\"\n\nHe spoke of the awkwardness, the discomfort, the lingering stigma. \"Like a stain on the soul,\" he murmured, \"a secret kept too long.\" He looked at them, eyes hard, \"But the truth is...it's a seed already sown. It grows in the silence, in the shadows. It waits for the right moment to bloom.\"\n\nHe paused, letting the silence hang heavy, \"They both have their price. Alcohol, a slow poison. Marijuana, a veil over the heart.\" He sighed, \"It's a dance with darkness, isn't it? Each step a choice, each consequence a lesson.\"",
            "The man spoke, his voice a rasp against the silence. \"Yes, I would say yes.\"  A pause, a drawl, the kind that stretched and thinned the air. \n\n\"Because...\" he began, then faltered.  \"These traditions, they're like roots sunk deep. They've held fast for a time, and that's something to reckon with. But the world, it shifts.  The wind changes course.  A tree needs to bend, or it breaks.\"\n\nHe paused, eyes distant, as if seeing something beyond the words.  \"They say there's a way, a right way.  Go to church every Sunday, kneel, pray, confess.  Believe as they say, live as they say. But what of the heart that bleeds a different truth? What of the soul that wanders in the shadows?\"\n\nHis voice dropped, a low murmur.  \"They judge, you see.  Don't take kindly to the different.  My father, he was an Episcopalian. My mother, Catholic.  They wouldn't let them wed.  Said it was against God's law.\"\n\nHe chuckled, a bitter sound. \"Love others, they preach.  Yet turn away those who aren't like them. A hollow echo, that.  Hypocrisy draped in holy robes.\"\n\n\"Devout, they are. Rigid.  Stuck in the ways.  Outdated, some might say.\"  A sigh, heavy and mournful.  \"They cling to the old stories, the old ways. But the world, it keeps moving.  And sometimes, the stories need to change.\"\n\nHe looked up, eyes searching, as if seeking answers in the empty space.\n\n\"No,\" he said finally.  \"They'd still find a way.\"\n\nHe shook his head, a slow, weary movement.  \"It's not the marriage that corrupts.  It's the darkness in the heart.  A shadow that darkens no matter the light.\"",
            "The matter weighs heavy. A knot in the gut. Right and wrong, blurred lines. This thing we wrestle with, the bleed of church and state, the definition of marriage, it cuts deep.  Like a bone saw splitting the marrow clean.  How do you speak of such things without waking the ghosts?  How do you thread the needle of tolerance without losing the thread altogether?\n\nMarriage, a sacrament, a covenant.  Some see it in the eyes of God. Others in the cold, hard steel of law.  Tax breaks, legal protections, the weight of the state upon the vows.  Baptism, a silent promise whispered in the dark.  But the state does not barge in on that, does it?  No, it leaves that to the unseen.\n\nSo what then? Civil union, a handshake, a contract. Two souls bound, two lives intertwined.  The government, a silent witness, a recorder. No need for judgment, just recognition.  Let them bind themselves, let them bear witness to each other's lives.  Let the church do its work in the shadows.\n\nThis is the crux, the heart of the quandary. A line drawn in the dust, shifting with every breath.  A nation divided, a nation searching. \n\nIf the states can find common ground, perhaps then the whole will follow.  But to amend the Constitution, to write darkness into the very fabric of the land, that is a dangerous game.  To ban a love, to etch it in stone, a stain on the soul of the nation. \n\nIt is a matter of weight, of consequence.  A matter that demands more than a careless brushstroke.  It demands a heart, a soul, a touch of grace.",
            "The boy's words hung in the air, a tremor in the silence. \"Homosexuality,\" he'd said, the word tasting strange, unfamiliar on his tongue. The man stared out at the dusty road stretching before them, the sun a bleached bone in the sky.  He knew the boy was looking at him, waiting for an answer, but the words felt like stones lodged in his throat.\n\nHe'd been raised in the church, bathed in the hymns and sermons of a God who seemed to offer only judgment and a narrow path. But the boy, innocent in his questions, had unearthed something deeper, something that had always lingered in the shadows. A question of freedom, of choice, a choice that seemed to cut against the grain of his upbringing.\n\nHe thought of his friends, the ones who lived lives different from his own, who loved beyond the lines drawn by the scriptures. He saw their faces, heard their laughter, felt the warmth of their acceptance. Could he deny their humanity, their right to love?\n\nThe answer came to him, slow and hard, like the grinding of rock against rock. It wasn't about agreement, not about condoning or condemning. It was about respect. About the right of each soul to find its own path, its own truth. It was about the freedom to choose, to love, to live.\n\n\"It's a matter for each state,\" he finally said, his voice rough with the unspoke words. \"Each place has its own way, its own story.\" \n\n\nHe looked at the boy, at the hope and confusion in his eyes. \"We can't force our beliefs on others,\" he said, \"but we can offer understanding. We can learn to live together, even when our paths diverge.\"",
            "The air hung thick and gray, the silence broken only by the rasp of his own breath. He stared at the screen, the words flickering like dying embers in the dim light. \"Myspace is a public thing,\" he mumbled, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. \"A bulletin board.\"  He paused, the knot in his chest tightening.  \"If you post something there, you have to know.\"  He swallowed hard, the taste of fear bitter on his tongue. \"People will see it.  School officials, anyone.\" \n\nHe remembered the old man's words, spoken in the twilight years, \"The world is a hard place, son.  The things you put into your head, they stay there. You forget what you want to remember, and you remember what you want to forget.\" He ran a calloused hand through his hair, the words echoing in the silence.  \n\n Was it wrong then, to protect the flock? To sift through the digital debris, searching for the whispers of danger before they turned into screams? Did they have a right, the guardians of the young, to peer into the corners of the internet, to see what lurked in the shadows?\n\nHe felt a cold hand grip his heart.  \"But what about privacy?\" he whispered, the question hanging heavy in the air.  The words seemed to dissolve into the dust motes dancing in the pale light.  \n\nHe thought of his own childhood, of the bare wood walls of his uncle's farmhouse, the smell of woodsmoke and damp earth, the endless silence broken only by the rustling leaves and the distant caw of a crow. He remembered the day he'd found his uncle's prized hunting rifle, hidden beneath the floorboards. The cold steel in his hand, the weight of it, the knowledge that it could take a life. \n\nHe'd kept that secret buried deep inside, a darkness he didn't dare share. But sometimes, in the dead of night, he'd wake up, the memory sharp and cold, the echo of the rifle's roar ringing in his ears.\n\nHe looked back at the screen. The words swam before his eyes, a blur of doubt and fear.  \"Maybe,\" he said finally, his voice a raspy whisper.  \"Maybe sometimes, the line between right and wrong is just a shadow.\"",
            "The war. A hot iron pressed to the gut. Nine Eleven. A wound raw and bleeding still. At first, the blood turned to rage.  It felt right, that fire. To go over there and lick the flames of their hate. But the fire choked, turned to ash. Now the bones of that rage ache.  We went in blind, fists clenched, hearts hammering. Like children with matches, not knowing the kindling would burn the whole damn forest. Didn't think of the smoke, the long aftermath, the way it would stain everything.\n\nThey fight themselves, those people. A sickness in their blood, a hunger that consumes. What good is our fire against such a thing? We went in to set them right, but the mirror showed back our own darkness.  \n\nThey’re not like us. Not human. Not anymore.  \n\nWe should have stayed home. Should have let the smoke rise and settle, let the dust fall like the slow decay of bone. But the fire took hold, and now it burns a hole in our souls. We went for revenge, they say. For justice. But all we found was more ashes."
