            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. It needs changing. Its grip loosens, its flock scattering. Too much clinging to the old ways.  The things they say, they hang like a shroud over the world. Gay marriage. Abortion. Birth control.  The Church stands firm, an island in a sea of shifting sands. Their words, they cut like stones against the tide. \n\nThey say it's the way it's always been, that the world is wrong. But the world keeps turning. People are different now. They yearn for something more, something that doesn't feel like a prison of stone.\n\nThe old men in their robes, they clutch their scriptures like shields. They speak of sin and damnation, but the young, they hear a different song. The song of freedom, of acceptance, of a world where love isn't a battleground. \n\nA world where a man can love another man and call it holy, where a woman can choose her own path, where a body is not owned by doctrine.\n\nThe Church, it whispers of eternity. But what good is eternity if it's built on a foundation of fear?",
            "The word hung in the air, a question mark heavy with the dust of a dying sun. \"Gay marriage.\" He shifted his weight, the words catching in his throat like a bone. The air was thick with the unspoken, the weight of a world where shadows fell long and choices felt like stones dropped into a well.\n\nHe knew some folks, folks who lived lives woven tight with the threads of their beliefs, who'd say it was wrong. A sin, they'd murmur, a stain on the fabric of things.  But he'd seen the fire in a man's eyes when he talked of the woman he loved, the way his hand trembled when he held hers. He'd seen the solace in a couple's embrace, the quiet strength in their shared gaze. Love, he thought, wasn't a choice. It was a wildfire, burning with a fierce and untamed light.\n\nHe thought of the boy he knew, the one with the bright eyes and the laughter that rang like chimes in the wind. A boy who loved his grandpa, loved the feel of the sun on his face, loved the stories of long ago. He thought of how unfair it would be to deny that boy the same chance at happiness, the same right to love and be loved.\n\nHe couldn't say he'd wrestled with the words, hadn't spent nights pondering the scriptures or arguing with the shadows in his mind. But he knew this: love wasn't a thing to be measured, weighed, or controlled. It was a force of nature, a wild river carving its own path. And if a river chose to flow in a direction different from the one expected, should it be dammed or diverted?\n\nHe thought of the federal government, its vast and unknowable reach, its hands always reaching, always grasping. He thought of its pronouncements, its laws, its attempts to shape the world into its own image. And he wondered if love, that untamed, unyielding force, could ever truly be contained.",
            "The air hung thick and low, a shroud over the words. \"Gay marriage,\" he rasped, the word tasting like ash on his tongue. \"Seems like there ain't no good reason not to.\"\n\nHis voice was a whisper against the wind, a frail thing against the silence of the empty field. He shifted his weight, the bones of his old boots crunching in the dust.\n\n\"Folks say it's a threat,\" he went on, his voice barely audible. \"To the family. But it ain't the same, is it? Two sides of a coin, maybe. But the face changes.\"\n\nHe squinted at the horizon, where the sun bled into the dying light. A ragged line of blood against the gray. \"Rights, those are what it boils down to. Property, healthcare... if you're with someone, you should be with them, no matter what.\"\n\nHe paused, a tremor running through his hands. \"They say it's against God's will. But what God? Whose God? The one who sits in judgment from a pulpit or the one that whispers in the wind? You can't legislate faith, not when faith itself is a whisper.\"\n\nHis gaze drifted to the distant city, a hulking silhouette against the fading light. \"There's children involved, too. They need their parents, both of them. Not just the ones who happen to bleed the same.\"\n\nHe looked back at the empty field, the wind whipping his hair. \"This ain't about morality,\" he said, his voice barely a sigh. \"It's about love, about family, about human decency. Ain't that what matters? Ain't that what's worth fighting for?\"",
            "The air in the pharmacy hung thick with the smell of disinfectant and the ghosts of a thousand ailments. He had seen the shadows of death in those aisles, glimpsed them in the pale eyes of the dying and the chalky dust of their bones. And yet, the question before him was not of life or death but of a green, leafy thing, a weed that whispered promises of solace and oblivion.\n\n\"Just because it's outlawed,\" he said, his voice rasping like a rusty hinge, \"doesn't make it poison.\" He paused, the words catching in the dry air. \"The law's a fickle mistress, blind to truth and swayed by whispers.\" \n\nHe saw the unease in the other man's eyes, the flicker of judgment. \"There are things,\" he continued, \"things the law keeps locked away, things deemed dangerous, but used by those who know better. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets - names whispered in darkened rooms, pills dispensed with measured caution. Yet they ease pain, offer a reprieve from the world's harsh edges.\"\n\nHe let the silence settle, thick and heavy, then leaned forward. \"Marijuana. It's not a monster, not a demon to be feared. It's a whisper in the wind, a balm for the weary soul. To deny its potential, to cling to ignorance, that's the real crime.\"\n\nHe saw the other man's hesitation, the battle being waged in his gaze. \"A gradual easing,\" he offered, \"a lifting of the veil, not a sudden flood. Let people see its face, understand its nature. Then, perhaps, they'll use it wisely, not as a crutch, but as a tool.\"\n\nHe knew the fight was not won, not yet. But he'd planted a seed, a sliver of doubt in the sterile soil of fear. Maybe, just maybe, it would grow.",
            "The church, she's changed some. Evolved, I guess. Not the iron fist it used to be. When I was a child, Sundays meant a dress, shoes, purse - the whole shebang. Matching, of course. Private school, all the friends there, every week the same ritual. Now?  They've got this thing, a teenager mass. Thirty minutes flat.  Folks come straight from the beach, sand still in their hair, kids running late. Jeans, khakis - nobody's in their Sunday best anymore. Not even at the morning service, where I used to be all dressed up.  It's a different world in there now. \n\nThe truth is, that's all I know. The church I grew up in, the one with the stained glass and the smell of incense. Not the politics, not the whispers. Just the pews and the hymns.  Those things, they're the shadow of what else might be out there.\n\nAs for those stories, the ones about the priests... you can't blame the robes, the vows.  There are married men who do those things, too. It's a sickness, a darkness inside. You can't legislate against that. If a man's drawn to that kind of darkness, a wedding ring won't stop it.\n\nThere are other paths, other faiths where a man can be a man and a priest.  Didn't they have that on some show? Seventh Heaven, something like that? A minister, married, with kids.  Maybe that's where they belong, those who want both.",
            "The ash hung heavy, a shroud over everything. The air itself tasted of it, a metallic tang on the tongue.  He thought of the day, September eleventh, the way the world had cracked open and spilled its guts. A lie then, a lie now. Bin Laden, weapons of mass destruction, all smoke and mirrors. They’d gone in believing, or pretended to. The man gazed at the boy, at the innocence etched in his young face, and a bitter taste rose in his throat. He’d seen the truth in Powell’s eyes, the flicker of doubt even as he spun the web of deceit. Malfeasance. A word fit for a king, but a king who’d traded his crown for a shroud of lies.\n\nThe Constitution, twisted and contorted, a broken promise. The Bush men, father and son, fueled by vengeance and the scent of oil. War, a hungry beast, always wanting more.\n\nHe thought of the lake, a mirror reflecting the sky, the air thick with the smell of pine and rot. The oars, a steady rhythm, the only sound. His uncle, pipe clenched between his teeth, a silhouette against the dying light. A day carved in memory, a day before the world went mad.\n\nNow, the country bled, a slow, agonizing death. The boy would grow up knowing only the taste of ash. The UN, a hollow shell, the coalition a patchwork of broken promises.  The Parliament, a stage for the play of shadows, the puppet masters pulling the strings. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, adrift in a sea of chaos. Sadr, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, his fangs bared.\n\nHe closed his eyes, saw the boy’s face, the question in his eyes. Could he answer it? Could he explain the madness, the betrayal, the endless cycle of violence?\n\nThe world was broken. And he didn’t know how to fix it.",
            "The boy sat hunched, the plastic tarp a ragged shroud against the damp.  He spoke in a voice thin as a sparrow's call. \"How I feel about the war in Iraq.\" His words hung in the air, catching on the silence like smoke.\n\n\"Mmhmm,\" I said, my gaze fixed on the ash-streaked road that stretched before us, leading into the grayness.  \n\n\"Just talk into it?\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"Ok, cool.\"\n\nHe hesitated, his eyes fixed on the worn leather of his worn shoes. \"Um, at this point I feel it's kind of pointless. I mean, it ain't even a real war, not declared, you know?\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"And it feels like it was just a way to get back at Iraq, like payback for 9/11. You know, they figured that's who did it.\" He kicked at a loose stone, sending it skittering across the barren ground. \"I don't know the big picture, the details. But it feels like we're stuck there now, trying to build democracy. To make it another America. Like we're taking their land and their oil.\" He shook his head, the movement sluggish, weary. \"But it ain't right. It's making everyone angry.\"\n\nHe fell silent, his gaze drawn to the horizon where the sky bled into the dust. \"You forget things, don't you?\" he said finally, his voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, my voice rough. \"You forget what you want to remember, and remember what you want to forget.\"\n\n\nHe looked up at me, his eyes filled with a darkness that belied his years. \"What if it never ends?\" he asked, his voice trembling. \"What if we keep going back and forth, fighting, trying to make it something it's not?\"\n\nI had no answer for him. Only the wind, sighing through the ashes, a constant, mournful dirge.",
            "The air hung thick with the smell of dust and ashes. The man sat hunched in the shade of a bleached oak, its branches skeletal against the gray sky. His words were dry as the land itself, rasping out like the wind through dead leaves.\n\n\"It ain't right,\" he said, his voice a low rumble. \"Not right for the government to push its will on what the Lord's house should stand for. The Constitution, it says clear as day, separation of church and state. They try to tangle them up, they're going against what's been set down, what's carved in stone.\"\n\nHe spat a mouthful of tobacco juice onto the parched ground.\n\n\"They try to make it law, they're choosing one church's creed over another. The Catholics, the Christians, most of 'em, they're against it. But in some of those fancy cities, Boston, they're different. But that ain't the point. It ain't the government's place to decide what's right and wrong for souls.\" \n\nHe looked up at the endless expanse of sky, a bruised canvas of gray and blue.\n\n\"Separation, that's what it's all about. Tolerance. They want to change it, they're going against what the founders built. It ain't about restricting the people, it's about restricting the church. Ain't right.\"\n\nHe took a long drag from his cigarette, the ember glowing like a malevolent eye in the gloom.\n\n\"The government, they shouldn't be sniffing around this at all. The churches, they should be left to their own ways. This ain't about the economy or progress, it's about the soul. And the soul, that's a private affair.\" \n\nHe crushed the cigarette under his boot heel, the red glow fading into the dust.",
            "The air in Iraq hung thick, a shroud of dust and ash settling over everything like a bad memory. The government back home, they hadn't been straight with us, not about why we were there. 9/11, they said. A link to the terrorists. But it felt different, a lie whispered in the wind, a phantom echo of something else. They'd used our anger, our fear, to push us into this mess. 2003, the year the bombs fell, the year the world changed. \n\nWar. I ain't for it, never have been. A preemptive strike? That's just a fancy word for a fistfight before the other guy even throws a punch. Vietnam, they should've learned then. Same mistakes, same hollow victories.\n\nAmerican boys dying, good boys, for what? Just to rip out the heart of a country, leave it bleeding and broken. They talked about democracy, about planting new seeds, but they weren't prepared for the weeds that would grow, the ghosts that would rise from the dirt.  \n\nChaos, that's what they left behind. A vacuum, a power vacuum, sucking in the darkness. And we, we were the ones left to pick up the pieces.\n\nI remember the lake, years ago. My uncle, his straw hat pulled low, his pipe clenched between his teeth. We'd go out there for firewood, the air cold and sharp.  He'd tell me stories, about the old days, about the world before the darkness. He'd say, \"Some things you just can't control, son. The wind, the rain, the tide.\"\n\nBut the war, that wasn't something we couldn't control. It was us. We made it, and now we're stuck with it, like a stain on our souls.\n\nWe're still there, even now.  They talk about peace, about a new beginning, but the air is still thick with dust and ash. And the ghosts, they're still haunting us.",
            "The world, he thought, was gray. Ash-colored, like the bones of some long dead thing. And the bones, they knew. They knew the weight of the world, the burden of it. They knew the slow, relentless push of time. Same as the boy. Same as him.  \n\nHe believed in the rightness of it. This thing, this love, this union. It wasn't a choice, not in the way a man might choose to wear a hat or a coat. This was deeper, woven into the fabric of a man's being. As sure as the sun rose and set, as sure as the wind whispered through the trees.  \n\nHe'd seen it in his own neighborhood, in the quiet corners, the shared laughter, the unspoken understanding. Two men, two women, the same as any other couple, walking their dogs, sharing a meal, their lives a testament to something primal, something ancient.\n\nPolitics, he thought, were shadows. They danced and gestured, but they held no real power. This was a matter of the heart, a matter of the soul.  \n\nThey say it's a choice, they say it's a phase. But the boy, he knew better. He felt it too, the pull, the ache, the yearning. It was in his blood, in his bones.\n\nAnd God, he thought, God had a way of turning the world upside down. He'd seen it. He'd lived it. The world was full of shadows, but there were glimmers of light too. He held onto those glimmers, those fragile sparks of hope, like a man clinging to a raft in a storm.\n\nHe wouldn't let them extinguish the fire in his soul. Not while there was breath left in his body. Not while the boy still held his hand.",
            "The road stretched out like a vein of ash across the gutted landscape. Empty.  Sun a pale disc in the gray sky, barely piercing the dust.  He pushed the cart, the boy beside him, their shadows long and skeletal in the dust.  \n\n\"You think anyone else is out there?\" the boy asked. His voice thin, a whisper against the wind.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said. \"Maybe not.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence broken only by the scrape of the cart wheels on the cracked asphalt.  \n\n\"What if we were the only ones left?\" the boy asked, his eyes wide with a fear he tried to hide.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his face stained with dust, the lines around his eyes deep and etched. \"Then we'd have to take care of each other,\" he said.  \"That's all there is.\"\n\nThey stopped at the edge of a town, skeletal buildings rising from the ash like bleached bones.  Cars lay overturned, their metal hulls twisted and broken.  A silence hung over the place, thick and suffocating.\n\n\"It's like a graveyard,\" the boy murmured.\n\n\"Everything dies,\" he said, his voice rough. \"Even words. Even memories.\"\n\nThey walked through the streets, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay.  He felt a chill, not from the cold, but from the emptiness. The boy clung to his hand, his small fingers cold and clammy.\n\nThey found a house, its windows boarded up, its roof sagging.  He pushed open the door, the hinges groaning in protest. Inside, the air was stale and thick with the smell of dust and dampness.\n\n\"Someone lived here,\" the boy whispered, his voice echoing in the emptiness.\n\nHe nodded. \"Yes,\" he said. \"But they're gone now. Just like everyone else.\" \n\nThey sat down on the floor, the boy's head resting against his side.  He pulled the boy closer, trying to shield him from the cold, from the emptiness.\n\n\"Do you think there's still good in the world?\" the boy asked, his voice barely audible.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, the question hanging in the air between them.  He didn't know the answer.  He had seen too much darkness, too much pain.\n\nHe closed his eyes, trying to find a flicker of hope in the ashes. \"Maybe,\" he said, his voice a whisper. \"Maybe.\"",
            "The war. It stretched on, a festering wound. A purpose once clear, a noble aim to bring democracy to a land choked by tyranny.  But the light had dimmed. The reasons, once etched in righteousness, had blurred into something indistinct, something like a thirst for power, a hunger to prove dominion. The echoes of a father’s old quarrels, shadows cast by a past that lingered like smoke, clung to the edges of this manufactured conflict. \n\nWas it a just cause then? To free a people from shackles, to offer them the promise of a voice? Perhaps. But the years had bled away the purity. The initial blows, swift and decisive, had spoken volumes.  But the brutal dance of war continued, a macabre waltz with death, fueled by a need to conquer, to dominate. \n\nThe land itself seemed to wither under the weight of this protracted struggle. The coffers emptied, the blood spilled, the spirit broken.  A nation bled while its own children starved. The streets of its cities echoed with the cries of the forgotten, the silent pleas of those left behind. Billions diverted from schools and hospitals, from bridges and roads, poured into the maw of war, a bottomless pit of destruction.\n\nThere comes a point, he thought, when a people must stand on their own. When a nation must learn to defend its own destiny.  The time had come to withdraw, to sever the umbilical cord that bound them to this quagmire.  Let them face their demons, their own internal struggles.  Let them rise or fall by their own choices.",
            "The boy's voice, thin and reedy as a wind through the bone trees. \"Can I ask a question?\" \n\nHe turned from the cracked window, the gray light outside a reflection of the ash inside. \"Sure.\" \n\n\"About that thing... with the internet.\"\n\nHe knew. He could feel the boy's eyes on him, probing, wary. \"Maybe you shouldn't. Some things are best left unsaid.\"\n\n\"But someone saw something. And stopped it. Is that bad?\"\n\nHe leaned back, the rusted springs of the chair groaning. \"The world is full of shadows. Some places you don't want to look too hard.\"\n\nThe boy persisted. \"But if someone saw something bad... and stopped it... is that bad?\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, his face pale and drawn, etched with the same dust that clung to everything in this place.\n\n\"The internet,\" he said, \"is a mirror. And sometimes the things it shows are not meant for human eyes. Some things are better left buried.\"\n\nThe boy was silent. His eyes, dark and watchful, like those of a wild creature.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" he whispered, finally. \"It feels like...\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Like the bad things are always coming. Like we're running from them.\" \n\nHe reached out and touched the boy's shoulder, the flesh cold and thin beneath his hand.\n\n\"We are,\" he said, his voice hoarse. \"But we run together.\"",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, choked with the dust of a thousand broken promises. \"Hmm,\" he rasped, the sound catching in his throat like a bird with a broken wing. \"Um,\" he stumbled, words like stones tumbling down a dry gulch. \"We only have this, and then one more time about the war.  Um, yeah. I mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it, you know. I hate to say it, I hate to join that chorus of voices, the ones that bleat 'I was against it from the start.' Um, I was, but it's not about that anymore. The truth sits heavy now, a stone in the gut –  the consensus, even amidst the whispering halls of power, was that it was a fool's errand. A bad idea.\"  \n\nHe paused, letting the silence stretch, a shroud over the words unspoken. \"The polls are there, you see. United States, Iraq, the world. Seventy-five, eighty percent. They say it was a mistake. Eighty percent of the Iraqis themselves, seventy percent of the men sent to fight, they say it, too.  Pull out, they say. Within the year.  It's been a disaster, from the first breath of that poisoned wind. A festering wound, and now the healing, the pulling back, is another wound in waiting.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he sighed, the sound a crack in the dry earth. \"There's no easy way out in that tangled desert. It's a clash, you see? A storm of cultures, a gulf too wide to bridge. The administration, they don't understand. They think they can force their light on a land that doesn't want it. Democracy, a seed sown in barren ground, choked by the dust of difference. Yes, Saddam was a monster, but was this the answer? To tear down a tyrant and build a phantom in its place?\"\n\nHe looked away, his gaze lost in the dust devils dancing across the wasteland of his words. \" Just quicksand, all of it.  I don't know what to say.  There's no reason to stay.  They'll have their justifications, their carefully crafted narratives, but they're empty words.  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, a quarter say now.  We're trying to help them, they tell us to leave. Maybe they know better. Maybe they know what's best for them.\"   He thought of the exodus, a slow, agonizing crawl back into the darkness. \"Gradual, maybe. A year, a little longer, but no more.  We can't be the saviors, not anymore. We're just a stain on the land.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the stink of ash and memory. He knew, yes, knew it in the bone-deep chill that settled on him like a shroud. Gendered judgment, it was a hunger that gnawed at the belly of the world, a sickness that festered in the marrow. Women, men, bound by the same chains, each to their own appointed role. \n\nHe'd seen it in the way the city, a skeletal carcass of concrete and steel, still held its breath, waiting for the day when men would rise again to claim it, to rebuild the monuments of their own making. The women, they lingered in the shadows, ghosts in dresses of dust, their whispers lost on the wind.  \n\nIt wasn't just the women, though.  He saw it in the hard eyes of the men who worked the empty fields, their calloused hands clutching at the tattered remnants of pride. The men who stayed home, tending to the ashes of broken dreams, their spirits withered like the crops.\n\nThey all wore the scars, these men and women, the marks of a world that refused to let them be whole. And the truth was, the world saw them only in fragments, a shattered reflection of what it wished them to be. A woman in a chair, a man with calloused hands, a boy with a book. Nothing more.\n\nHe thought of the young ones, the children who were still learning the language of this broken world. They would carry the weight of these judgments, these invisible shackles, until they, too, learned to wear the masks of conformity.  \n\nBut he saw a flicker of hope in their eyes, a defiant spark that refused to be extinguished. They were the seeds of change, waiting to bloom in the ashes of the old world. They would be the ones to break the chains, to rewrite the story. They would be the ones to build a world where gender was not a cage, where the human heart was free to soar.",
            "The air hung thick and cold. They said it wasn't legal, not really. Decriminalized, they called it. A slap on the wrist, a fine, not the cold steel of the cage. But the fear, the shadow of it, lingered. The marks it left, on your soul, on your chances. It lingered in the whispers, in the eyes of men, in the silence between words.  \n\nThey said it freed up money. Money for schools, for the hungry, for the sick. Money they could use to mend the cracks in this broken world. But the cracks ran deep. The heart of the matter, they said, was the money.\n\nSome places, the old ways held tight. Stubborn, clinging to the fear. But others, they saw the light. Denver, they called it. A place where the wind carried whispers of change, where the old ways crumbled in the face of a new dawn.\n\nMaybe, he thought, it wasn't about the money. Maybe it was about the change. The way it seeped into the air, the way it shifted the ground beneath your feet. The way it made you question everything you thought you knew.\n\nHe saw it in the faces of the young, the way their eyes lit up with a dangerous hope. They weren't afraid of the shadows. They wanted to dance in them.\n\nBut the old ways, they cast a long shadow. A shadow that stretched across the years, across generations. A shadow that whispered of danger, of loss, of a world that could never be fully reclaimed.\n\nHe remembered the lake, the stillness of the water, the smell of pine needles and damp earth. The slow, rhythmic stroke of the oars, the creaking of the boat. His uncle's pipe, the smoke curling in the air. A moment of perfect peace, a memory etched in the heart of the past.\n\nBut the world moved on. The shadows lengthened. And the wind carried a new kind of smoke.",
            "The thing is, yeah, they do things a certain way. Old ways. Been doing 'em for a spell.  Rooted, you know? But the world ain't what it was. Times change. Gotta bend a little.  \n\nThey say church every week, gotta follow the book.  Strict, that's for sure.  And they look down on folks who don't fit the mold.  Folks who ain't perfect. Folks who pray to a different God.  \n\nLike my old man.  Episcopalian.  My Ma, Catholic.  Wouldn't marry them in the Church.  Said it was against the rules.  Hypocrisy, I tell ya.  Love your neighbor, they say. But turn your back on 'em if they ain't one of them. \n\nIt's like the rules are one thing, and the way they live another.  Old ways dying hard, that's for sure.\n\nNow, about those priests...\n\nThey say letting 'em marry would fix things.  Make 'em better men.  But that ain't the root of the problem, is it?  Some folks, they got a sickness.  Don't matter if they got a wife or not.  They gonna do what they gonna do.\n\nIt ain't about marriage, it's about the darkness inside.",
            "The thing is, the way things stand now, it's a knot you can't untie. Church and state, marriage, it's all tangled up.  One hand reaching for the other, grabbing hold, and you can't say if one's right or wrong.  It's a hard sort of question, see?  Something as close as that,  it cuts both ways. \n\nWhat's marriage anyway?  Government business or something else?   If it's a sacrament, shouldn't the church be the one to decide? Like baptism, it's a matter of faith.  No tax breaks, no special treatment from the state. Just two souls bound together. \n\nBut if it's just two people, why the fuss? Why not call it a civil union?  What difference does it make? It's a joining, a commitment. \n\nAnd this whole business with gay marriage... it's like they're trying to draw lines in the sand.  Two souls, just like any other, wanting to join.  Why deny them that? \n\nMaybe if all the states could see eye to eye, they could make it a law.  But a constitutional amendment to ban it? That's just wrong.  The Constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.  It's not some great moral crisis.  It's just love, plain and simple.\n\n\nNo.  An amendment? That's just too much.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and ash. He shifted the weight of the world on his shoulders, a world that seemed to tilt on its axis, forever teetering between light and dark.  The question, it coiled in his gut like a snake, cold and insistent. It slithered through his mind, leaving a trail of unease.  Homosexuality. A word that tasted like brimstone in his mouth.  \n\nHe’d been raised in the shadow of a steeple, bathed in the glow of Sunday sermons.  But the world outside, the world he’d come to know, it was a tangled mess of contradictions. He had friends, bright souls with laughter in their eyes, who walked a path different from his own. A path that led them to solace in each other’s arms, a love that burned with a fierce, undeniable light.\n\nThe law, it was a tangled web spun by men with hands stained with hypocrisy. Should the weight of their judgment, their fear, dictate the course of another’s life? He didn’t have the answers, not the kind that would satisfy the searching in his soul. But he knew this:  \n\nLove, it was a river, ever flowing, ever changing. To try to dam it, to confine it within the rigid banks of man-made laws, was to invite catastrophe.\n\nThe states, they were the building blocks of this nation, each a microcosm of its own desires, its own demons.  Some, they held fast to the old ways, their hearts hardened by tradition. Others, they embraced the new, their souls open to the possibility of change.\n\nHe wasn’t a man of power, not a king nor a congressman. But he knew this:  A man’s heart, it belonged to him alone. To love, to choose, to find solace in another’s embrace, these were the truest expressions of his freedom.  And if the law could not, or would not, protect that freedom, then it was a law that had lost its way.",
            "The boy huddled close, his breath a thin hiss in the cold.  \"We going to die?\" he asked. The question hung in the air, a bone sliver in the gray silence.\n\nThe man looked at him, the firelight catching the hard angles of his face. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice a rasp. \"Sometime. But not now.\"\n\nThe boy shivered. \"We still going south?\"\n\n\"Yes. We'll be warm.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, a small sound lost in the wind. He stared into the flames, his eyes dark and unblinking.  The man watched him, a cold knot in his gut.  He knew the boy was too young to understand, too young to grasp the bleak weight of their journey.\n\nOutside, the wind howled a mournful song, rattling the bones of the abandoned shack. The world was a canvas of ash and shadow, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay. They had been traveling for weeks, ever since the city had fallen. Since the fire had come.  \n\nHe had seen things, things that would stain his soul. Things he could never unsee. But the boy, he was still innocent. Still held onto a sliver of hope. The man wouldn't allow that hope to be extinguished. He would protect it, even if it meant sacrificing everything else.\n\nHe pulled his threadbare cloak tighter around him, the worn fabric offering little comfort against the cold. The fire sputtered, sending a shower of sparks into the night. He reached out and took the boy's hand, feeling the small, trembling fingers clutch at his own.\n\n\"Do you think God sees us?\" the boy asked.\n\nThe man squeezed his hand, his gaze fixed on the dancing flames. \"He sees everything,\" he said, his voice barely a whisper.",
            "The dust of the world clung to everything. The air itself tasted like ash. The war. It had begun in the gut, a knot of rage after the towers fell.  A rising tide of vengeance. He'd been ready to go, to drown the hatred in blood.  But the blood hadn't washed it clean.  Just stained it deeper.\n\nHe'd seen the truth in the long nights, the hollow echoes of reason lost in the howling wind. They went in blind, fists clenched, hearts aflame. No plan, no map. Just a thirst for retribution.  \n\nAnd the wasteland they'd carved out, it mirrored the emptiness inside. The people there, they were caught in a different kind of war, a war without rules, without reason. A war fought with the tools of survival.\n\nHe'd seen their faces, the weary eyes, the hard lines etched deep by a kind of hunger that couldn't be appeased. They were fighting for scraps, for a sliver of hope in a world gone mad.  And they saw him, a stranger, a bringer of his own kind of chaos.\n\nThey were not savages, not monsters. Just men and women trying to survive in a world where survival meant fighting.\n\nHe'd lost the fire in his belly, replaced by a cold, gnawing understanding. The war had birthed a monster, and they were all feeding it.  He had no answers, only the ashes of what had been.  Only the knowledge that they should have stayed away."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. It needs changing. Its grip loosens, its flock scattering. Too much clinging to the old ways.  The things they say, they hang like a shroud over the world. Gay marriage. Abortion. Birth control.  The Church stands firm, an island in a sea of shifting sands. Their words, they cut like stones against the tide. \n\nThey say it's the way it's always been, that the world is wrong. But the world keeps turning. People are different now. They yearn for something more, something that doesn't feel like a prison of stone.\n\nThe old men in their robes, they clutch their scriptures like shields. They speak of sin and damnation, but the young, they hear a different song. The song of freedom, of acceptance, of a world where love isn't a battleground. \n\nA world where a man can love another man and call it holy, where a woman can choose her own path, where a body is not owned by doctrine.\n\nThe Church, it whispers of eternity. But what good is eternity if it's built on a foundation of fear?",
            "The word hung in the air, a question mark heavy with the dust of a dying sun. \"Gay marriage.\" He shifted his weight, the words catching in his throat like a bone. The air was thick with the unspoken, the weight of a world where shadows fell long and choices felt like stones dropped into a well.\n\nHe knew some folks, folks who lived lives woven tight with the threads of their beliefs, who'd say it was wrong. A sin, they'd murmur, a stain on the fabric of things.  But he'd seen the fire in a man's eyes when he talked of the woman he loved, the way his hand trembled when he held hers. He'd seen the solace in a couple's embrace, the quiet strength in their shared gaze. Love, he thought, wasn't a choice. It was a wildfire, burning with a fierce and untamed light.\n\nHe thought of the boy he knew, the one with the bright eyes and the laughter that rang like chimes in the wind. A boy who loved his grandpa, loved the feel of the sun on his face, loved the stories of long ago. He thought of how unfair it would be to deny that boy the same chance at happiness, the same right to love and be loved.\n\nHe couldn't say he'd wrestled with the words, hadn't spent nights pondering the scriptures or arguing with the shadows in his mind. But he knew this: love wasn't a thing to be measured, weighed, or controlled. It was a force of nature, a wild river carving its own path. And if a river chose to flow in a direction different from the one expected, should it be dammed or diverted?\n\nHe thought of the federal government, its vast and unknowable reach, its hands always reaching, always grasping. He thought of its pronouncements, its laws, its attempts to shape the world into its own image. And he wondered if love, that untamed, unyielding force, could ever truly be contained.",
            "The air hung thick and low, a shroud over the words. \"Gay marriage,\" he rasped, the word tasting like ash on his tongue. \"Seems like there ain't no good reason not to.\"\n\nHis voice was a whisper against the wind, a frail thing against the silence of the empty field. He shifted his weight, the bones of his old boots crunching in the dust.\n\n\"Folks say it's a threat,\" he went on, his voice barely audible. \"To the family. But it ain't the same, is it? Two sides of a coin, maybe. But the face changes.\"\n\nHe squinted at the horizon, where the sun bled into the dying light. A ragged line of blood against the gray. \"Rights, those are what it boils down to. Property, healthcare... if you're with someone, you should be with them, no matter what.\"\n\nHe paused, a tremor running through his hands. \"They say it's against God's will. But what God? Whose God? The one who sits in judgment from a pulpit or the one that whispers in the wind? You can't legislate faith, not when faith itself is a whisper.\"\n\nHis gaze drifted to the distant city, a hulking silhouette against the fading light. \"There's children involved, too. They need their parents, both of them. Not just the ones who happen to bleed the same.\"\n\nHe looked back at the empty field, the wind whipping his hair. \"This ain't about morality,\" he said, his voice barely a sigh. \"It's about love, about family, about human decency. Ain't that what matters? Ain't that what's worth fighting for?\"",
            "The air in the pharmacy hung thick with the smell of disinfectant and the ghosts of a thousand ailments. He had seen the shadows of death in those aisles, glimpsed them in the pale eyes of the dying and the chalky dust of their bones. And yet, the question before him was not of life or death but of a green, leafy thing, a weed that whispered promises of solace and oblivion.\n\n\"Just because it's outlawed,\" he said, his voice rasping like a rusty hinge, \"doesn't make it poison.\" He paused, the words catching in the dry air. \"The law's a fickle mistress, blind to truth and swayed by whispers.\" \n\nHe saw the unease in the other man's eyes, the flicker of judgment. \"There are things,\" he continued, \"things the law keeps locked away, things deemed dangerous, but used by those who know better. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets - names whispered in darkened rooms, pills dispensed with measured caution. Yet they ease pain, offer a reprieve from the world's harsh edges.\"\n\nHe let the silence settle, thick and heavy, then leaned forward. \"Marijuana. It's not a monster, not a demon to be feared. It's a whisper in the wind, a balm for the weary soul. To deny its potential, to cling to ignorance, that's the real crime.\"\n\nHe saw the other man's hesitation, the battle being waged in his gaze. \"A gradual easing,\" he offered, \"a lifting of the veil, not a sudden flood. Let people see its face, understand its nature. Then, perhaps, they'll use it wisely, not as a crutch, but as a tool.\"\n\nHe knew the fight was not won, not yet. But he'd planted a seed, a sliver of doubt in the sterile soil of fear. Maybe, just maybe, it would grow.",
            "The church, she's changed some. Evolved, I guess. Not the iron fist it used to be. When I was a child, Sundays meant a dress, shoes, purse - the whole shebang. Matching, of course. Private school, all the friends there, every week the same ritual. Now?  They've got this thing, a teenager mass. Thirty minutes flat.  Folks come straight from the beach, sand still in their hair, kids running late. Jeans, khakis - nobody's in their Sunday best anymore. Not even at the morning service, where I used to be all dressed up.  It's a different world in there now. \n\nThe truth is, that's all I know. The church I grew up in, the one with the stained glass and the smell of incense. Not the politics, not the whispers. Just the pews and the hymns.  Those things, they're the shadow of what else might be out there.\n\nAs for those stories, the ones about the priests... you can't blame the robes, the vows.  There are married men who do those things, too. It's a sickness, a darkness inside. You can't legislate against that. If a man's drawn to that kind of darkness, a wedding ring won't stop it.\n\nThere are other paths, other faiths where a man can be a man and a priest.  Didn't they have that on some show? Seventh Heaven, something like that? A minister, married, with kids.  Maybe that's where they belong, those who want both.",
            "The ash hung heavy, a shroud over everything. The air itself tasted of it, a metallic tang on the tongue.  He thought of the day, September eleventh, the way the world had cracked open and spilled its guts. A lie then, a lie now. Bin Laden, weapons of mass destruction, all smoke and mirrors. They’d gone in believing, or pretended to. The man gazed at the boy, at the innocence etched in his young face, and a bitter taste rose in his throat. He’d seen the truth in Powell’s eyes, the flicker of doubt even as he spun the web of deceit. Malfeasance. A word fit for a king, but a king who’d traded his crown for a shroud of lies.\n\nThe Constitution, twisted and contorted, a broken promise. The Bush men, father and son, fueled by vengeance and the scent of oil. War, a hungry beast, always wanting more.\n\nHe thought of the lake, a mirror reflecting the sky, the air thick with the smell of pine and rot. The oars, a steady rhythm, the only sound. His uncle, pipe clenched between his teeth, a silhouette against the dying light. A day carved in memory, a day before the world went mad.\n\nNow, the country bled, a slow, agonizing death. The boy would grow up knowing only the taste of ash. The UN, a hollow shell, the coalition a patchwork of broken promises.  The Parliament, a stage for the play of shadows, the puppet masters pulling the strings. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, adrift in a sea of chaos. Sadr, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, his fangs bared.\n\nHe closed his eyes, saw the boy’s face, the question in his eyes. Could he answer it? Could he explain the madness, the betrayal, the endless cycle of violence?\n\nThe world was broken. And he didn’t know how to fix it.",
            "The boy sat hunched, the plastic tarp a ragged shroud against the damp.  He spoke in a voice thin as a sparrow's call. \"How I feel about the war in Iraq.\" His words hung in the air, catching on the silence like smoke.\n\n\"Mmhmm,\" I said, my gaze fixed on the ash-streaked road that stretched before us, leading into the grayness.  \n\n\"Just talk into it?\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"Ok, cool.\"\n\nHe hesitated, his eyes fixed on the worn leather of his worn shoes. \"Um, at this point I feel it's kind of pointless. I mean, it ain't even a real war, not declared, you know?\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"And it feels like it was just a way to get back at Iraq, like payback for 9/11. You know, they figured that's who did it.\" He kicked at a loose stone, sending it skittering across the barren ground. \"I don't know the big picture, the details. But it feels like we're stuck there now, trying to build democracy. To make it another America. Like we're taking their land and their oil.\" He shook his head, the movement sluggish, weary. \"But it ain't right. It's making everyone angry.\"\n\nHe fell silent, his gaze drawn to the horizon where the sky bled into the dust. \"You forget things, don't you?\" he said finally, his voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, my voice rough. \"You forget what you want to remember, and remember what you want to forget.\"\n\n\nHe looked up at me, his eyes filled with a darkness that belied his years. \"What if it never ends?\" he asked, his voice trembling. \"What if we keep going back and forth, fighting, trying to make it something it's not?\"\n\nI had no answer for him. Only the wind, sighing through the ashes, a constant, mournful dirge.",
            "The air hung thick with the smell of dust and ashes. The man sat hunched in the shade of a bleached oak, its branches skeletal against the gray sky. His words were dry as the land itself, rasping out like the wind through dead leaves.\n\n\"It ain't right,\" he said, his voice a low rumble. \"Not right for the government to push its will on what the Lord's house should stand for. The Constitution, it says clear as day, separation of church and state. They try to tangle them up, they're going against what's been set down, what's carved in stone.\"\n\nHe spat a mouthful of tobacco juice onto the parched ground.\n\n\"They try to make it law, they're choosing one church's creed over another. The Catholics, the Christians, most of 'em, they're against it. But in some of those fancy cities, Boston, they're different. But that ain't the point. It ain't the government's place to decide what's right and wrong for souls.\" \n\nHe looked up at the endless expanse of sky, a bruised canvas of gray and blue.\n\n\"Separation, that's what it's all about. Tolerance. They want to change it, they're going against what the founders built. It ain't about restricting the people, it's about restricting the church. Ain't right.\"\n\nHe took a long drag from his cigarette, the ember glowing like a malevolent eye in the gloom.\n\n\"The government, they shouldn't be sniffing around this at all. The churches, they should be left to their own ways. This ain't about the economy or progress, it's about the soul. And the soul, that's a private affair.\" \n\nHe crushed the cigarette under his boot heel, the red glow fading into the dust.",
            "The air in Iraq hung thick, a shroud of dust and ash settling over everything like a bad memory. The government back home, they hadn't been straight with us, not about why we were there. 9/11, they said. A link to the terrorists. But it felt different, a lie whispered in the wind, a phantom echo of something else. They'd used our anger, our fear, to push us into this mess. 2003, the year the bombs fell, the year the world changed. \n\nWar. I ain't for it, never have been. A preemptive strike? That's just a fancy word for a fistfight before the other guy even throws a punch. Vietnam, they should've learned then. Same mistakes, same hollow victories.\n\nAmerican boys dying, good boys, for what? Just to rip out the heart of a country, leave it bleeding and broken. They talked about democracy, about planting new seeds, but they weren't prepared for the weeds that would grow, the ghosts that would rise from the dirt.  \n\nChaos, that's what they left behind. A vacuum, a power vacuum, sucking in the darkness. And we, we were the ones left to pick up the pieces.\n\nI remember the lake, years ago. My uncle, his straw hat pulled low, his pipe clenched between his teeth. We'd go out there for firewood, the air cold and sharp.  He'd tell me stories, about the old days, about the world before the darkness. He'd say, \"Some things you just can't control, son. The wind, the rain, the tide.\"\n\nBut the war, that wasn't something we couldn't control. It was us. We made it, and now we're stuck with it, like a stain on our souls.\n\nWe're still there, even now.  They talk about peace, about a new beginning, but the air is still thick with dust and ash. And the ghosts, they're still haunting us.",
            "The world, he thought, was gray. Ash-colored, like the bones of some long dead thing. And the bones, they knew. They knew the weight of the world, the burden of it. They knew the slow, relentless push of time. Same as the boy. Same as him.  \n\nHe believed in the rightness of it. This thing, this love, this union. It wasn't a choice, not in the way a man might choose to wear a hat or a coat. This was deeper, woven into the fabric of a man's being. As sure as the sun rose and set, as sure as the wind whispered through the trees.  \n\nHe'd seen it in his own neighborhood, in the quiet corners, the shared laughter, the unspoken understanding. Two men, two women, the same as any other couple, walking their dogs, sharing a meal, their lives a testament to something primal, something ancient.\n\nPolitics, he thought, were shadows. They danced and gestured, but they held no real power. This was a matter of the heart, a matter of the soul.  \n\nThey say it's a choice, they say it's a phase. But the boy, he knew better. He felt it too, the pull, the ache, the yearning. It was in his blood, in his bones.\n\nAnd God, he thought, God had a way of turning the world upside down. He'd seen it. He'd lived it. The world was full of shadows, but there were glimmers of light too. He held onto those glimmers, those fragile sparks of hope, like a man clinging to a raft in a storm.\n\nHe wouldn't let them extinguish the fire in his soul. Not while there was breath left in his body. Not while the boy still held his hand.",
            "The road stretched out like a vein of ash across the gutted landscape. Empty.  Sun a pale disc in the gray sky, barely piercing the dust.  He pushed the cart, the boy beside him, their shadows long and skeletal in the dust.  \n\n\"You think anyone else is out there?\" the boy asked. His voice thin, a whisper against the wind.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said. \"Maybe not.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence broken only by the scrape of the cart wheels on the cracked asphalt.  \n\n\"What if we were the only ones left?\" the boy asked, his eyes wide with a fear he tried to hide.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his face stained with dust, the lines around his eyes deep and etched. \"Then we'd have to take care of each other,\" he said.  \"That's all there is.\"\n\nThey stopped at the edge of a town, skeletal buildings rising from the ash like bleached bones.  Cars lay overturned, their metal hulls twisted and broken.  A silence hung over the place, thick and suffocating.\n\n\"It's like a graveyard,\" the boy murmured.\n\n\"Everything dies,\" he said, his voice rough. \"Even words. Even memories.\"\n\nThey walked through the streets, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay.  He felt a chill, not from the cold, but from the emptiness. The boy clung to his hand, his small fingers cold and clammy.\n\nThey found a house, its windows boarded up, its roof sagging.  He pushed open the door, the hinges groaning in protest. Inside, the air was stale and thick with the smell of dust and dampness.\n\n\"Someone lived here,\" the boy whispered, his voice echoing in the emptiness.\n\nHe nodded. \"Yes,\" he said. \"But they're gone now. Just like everyone else.\" \n\nThey sat down on the floor, the boy's head resting against his side.  He pulled the boy closer, trying to shield him from the cold, from the emptiness.\n\n\"Do you think there's still good in the world?\" the boy asked, his voice barely audible.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, the question hanging in the air between them.  He didn't know the answer.  He had seen too much darkness, too much pain.\n\nHe closed his eyes, trying to find a flicker of hope in the ashes. \"Maybe,\" he said, his voice a whisper. \"Maybe.\"",
            "The war. It stretched on, a festering wound. A purpose once clear, a noble aim to bring democracy to a land choked by tyranny.  But the light had dimmed. The reasons, once etched in righteousness, had blurred into something indistinct, something like a thirst for power, a hunger to prove dominion. The echoes of a father’s old quarrels, shadows cast by a past that lingered like smoke, clung to the edges of this manufactured conflict. \n\nWas it a just cause then? To free a people from shackles, to offer them the promise of a voice? Perhaps. But the years had bled away the purity. The initial blows, swift and decisive, had spoken volumes.  But the brutal dance of war continued, a macabre waltz with death, fueled by a need to conquer, to dominate. \n\nThe land itself seemed to wither under the weight of this protracted struggle. The coffers emptied, the blood spilled, the spirit broken.  A nation bled while its own children starved. The streets of its cities echoed with the cries of the forgotten, the silent pleas of those left behind. Billions diverted from schools and hospitals, from bridges and roads, poured into the maw of war, a bottomless pit of destruction.\n\nThere comes a point, he thought, when a people must stand on their own. When a nation must learn to defend its own destiny.  The time had come to withdraw, to sever the umbilical cord that bound them to this quagmire.  Let them face their demons, their own internal struggles.  Let them rise or fall by their own choices.",
            "The boy's voice, thin and reedy as a wind through the bone trees. \"Can I ask a question?\" \n\nHe turned from the cracked window, the gray light outside a reflection of the ash inside. \"Sure.\" \n\n\"About that thing... with the internet.\"\n\nHe knew. He could feel the boy's eyes on him, probing, wary. \"Maybe you shouldn't. Some things are best left unsaid.\"\n\n\"But someone saw something. And stopped it. Is that bad?\"\n\nHe leaned back, the rusted springs of the chair groaning. \"The world is full of shadows. Some places you don't want to look too hard.\"\n\nThe boy persisted. \"But if someone saw something bad... and stopped it... is that bad?\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, his face pale and drawn, etched with the same dust that clung to everything in this place.\n\n\"The internet,\" he said, \"is a mirror. And sometimes the things it shows are not meant for human eyes. Some things are better left buried.\"\n\nThe boy was silent. His eyes, dark and watchful, like those of a wild creature.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" he whispered, finally. \"It feels like...\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Like the bad things are always coming. Like we're running from them.\" \n\nHe reached out and touched the boy's shoulder, the flesh cold and thin beneath his hand.\n\n\"We are,\" he said, his voice hoarse. \"But we run together.\"",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, choked with the dust of a thousand broken promises. \"Hmm,\" he rasped, the sound catching in his throat like a bird with a broken wing. \"Um,\" he stumbled, words like stones tumbling down a dry gulch. \"We only have this, and then one more time about the war.  Um, yeah. I mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it, you know. I hate to say it, I hate to join that chorus of voices, the ones that bleat 'I was against it from the start.' Um, I was, but it's not about that anymore. The truth sits heavy now, a stone in the gut –  the consensus, even amidst the whispering halls of power, was that it was a fool's errand. A bad idea.\"  \n\nHe paused, letting the silence stretch, a shroud over the words unspoken. \"The polls are there, you see. United States, Iraq, the world. Seventy-five, eighty percent. They say it was a mistake. Eighty percent of the Iraqis themselves, seventy percent of the men sent to fight, they say it, too.  Pull out, they say. Within the year.  It's been a disaster, from the first breath of that poisoned wind. A festering wound, and now the healing, the pulling back, is another wound in waiting.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he sighed, the sound a crack in the dry earth. \"There's no easy way out in that tangled desert. It's a clash, you see? A storm of cultures, a gulf too wide to bridge. The administration, they don't understand. They think they can force their light on a land that doesn't want it. Democracy, a seed sown in barren ground, choked by the dust of difference. Yes, Saddam was a monster, but was this the answer? To tear down a tyrant and build a phantom in its place?\"\n\nHe looked away, his gaze lost in the dust devils dancing across the wasteland of his words. \" Just quicksand, all of it.  I don't know what to say.  There's no reason to stay.  They'll have their justifications, their carefully crafted narratives, but they're empty words.  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, a quarter say now.  We're trying to help them, they tell us to leave. Maybe they know better. Maybe they know what's best for them.\"   He thought of the exodus, a slow, agonizing crawl back into the darkness. \"Gradual, maybe. A year, a little longer, but no more.  We can't be the saviors, not anymore. We're just a stain on the land.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the stink of ash and memory. He knew, yes, knew it in the bone-deep chill that settled on him like a shroud. Gendered judgment, it was a hunger that gnawed at the belly of the world, a sickness that festered in the marrow. Women, men, bound by the same chains, each to their own appointed role. \n\nHe'd seen it in the way the city, a skeletal carcass of concrete and steel, still held its breath, waiting for the day when men would rise again to claim it, to rebuild the monuments of their own making. The women, they lingered in the shadows, ghosts in dresses of dust, their whispers lost on the wind.  \n\nIt wasn't just the women, though.  He saw it in the hard eyes of the men who worked the empty fields, their calloused hands clutching at the tattered remnants of pride. The men who stayed home, tending to the ashes of broken dreams, their spirits withered like the crops.\n\nThey all wore the scars, these men and women, the marks of a world that refused to let them be whole. And the truth was, the world saw them only in fragments, a shattered reflection of what it wished them to be. A woman in a chair, a man with calloused hands, a boy with a book. Nothing more.\n\nHe thought of the young ones, the children who were still learning the language of this broken world. They would carry the weight of these judgments, these invisible shackles, until they, too, learned to wear the masks of conformity.  \n\nBut he saw a flicker of hope in their eyes, a defiant spark that refused to be extinguished. They were the seeds of change, waiting to bloom in the ashes of the old world. They would be the ones to break the chains, to rewrite the story. They would be the ones to build a world where gender was not a cage, where the human heart was free to soar.",
            "The air hung thick and cold. They said it wasn't legal, not really. Decriminalized, they called it. A slap on the wrist, a fine, not the cold steel of the cage. But the fear, the shadow of it, lingered. The marks it left, on your soul, on your chances. It lingered in the whispers, in the eyes of men, in the silence between words.  \n\nThey said it freed up money. Money for schools, for the hungry, for the sick. Money they could use to mend the cracks in this broken world. But the cracks ran deep. The heart of the matter, they said, was the money.\n\nSome places, the old ways held tight. Stubborn, clinging to the fear. But others, they saw the light. Denver, they called it. A place where the wind carried whispers of change, where the old ways crumbled in the face of a new dawn.\n\nMaybe, he thought, it wasn't about the money. Maybe it was about the change. The way it seeped into the air, the way it shifted the ground beneath your feet. The way it made you question everything you thought you knew.\n\nHe saw it in the faces of the young, the way their eyes lit up with a dangerous hope. They weren't afraid of the shadows. They wanted to dance in them.\n\nBut the old ways, they cast a long shadow. A shadow that stretched across the years, across generations. A shadow that whispered of danger, of loss, of a world that could never be fully reclaimed.\n\nHe remembered the lake, the stillness of the water, the smell of pine needles and damp earth. The slow, rhythmic stroke of the oars, the creaking of the boat. His uncle's pipe, the smoke curling in the air. A moment of perfect peace, a memory etched in the heart of the past.\n\nBut the world moved on. The shadows lengthened. And the wind carried a new kind of smoke.",
            "The thing is, yeah, they do things a certain way. Old ways. Been doing 'em for a spell.  Rooted, you know? But the world ain't what it was. Times change. Gotta bend a little.  \n\nThey say church every week, gotta follow the book.  Strict, that's for sure.  And they look down on folks who don't fit the mold.  Folks who ain't perfect. Folks who pray to a different God.  \n\nLike my old man.  Episcopalian.  My Ma, Catholic.  Wouldn't marry them in the Church.  Said it was against the rules.  Hypocrisy, I tell ya.  Love your neighbor, they say. But turn your back on 'em if they ain't one of them. \n\nIt's like the rules are one thing, and the way they live another.  Old ways dying hard, that's for sure.\n\nNow, about those priests...\n\nThey say letting 'em marry would fix things.  Make 'em better men.  But that ain't the root of the problem, is it?  Some folks, they got a sickness.  Don't matter if they got a wife or not.  They gonna do what they gonna do.\n\nIt ain't about marriage, it's about the darkness inside.",
            "The thing is, the way things stand now, it's a knot you can't untie. Church and state, marriage, it's all tangled up.  One hand reaching for the other, grabbing hold, and you can't say if one's right or wrong.  It's a hard sort of question, see?  Something as close as that,  it cuts both ways. \n\nWhat's marriage anyway?  Government business or something else?   If it's a sacrament, shouldn't the church be the one to decide? Like baptism, it's a matter of faith.  No tax breaks, no special treatment from the state. Just two souls bound together. \n\nBut if it's just two people, why the fuss? Why not call it a civil union?  What difference does it make? It's a joining, a commitment. \n\nAnd this whole business with gay marriage... it's like they're trying to draw lines in the sand.  Two souls, just like any other, wanting to join.  Why deny them that? \n\nMaybe if all the states could see eye to eye, they could make it a law.  But a constitutional amendment to ban it? That's just wrong.  The Constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.  It's not some great moral crisis.  It's just love, plain and simple.\n\n\nNo.  An amendment? That's just too much.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and ash. He shifted the weight of the world on his shoulders, a world that seemed to tilt on its axis, forever teetering between light and dark.  The question, it coiled in his gut like a snake, cold and insistent. It slithered through his mind, leaving a trail of unease.  Homosexuality. A word that tasted like brimstone in his mouth.  \n\nHe’d been raised in the shadow of a steeple, bathed in the glow of Sunday sermons.  But the world outside, the world he’d come to know, it was a tangled mess of contradictions. He had friends, bright souls with laughter in their eyes, who walked a path different from his own. A path that led them to solace in each other’s arms, a love that burned with a fierce, undeniable light.\n\nThe law, it was a tangled web spun by men with hands stained with hypocrisy. Should the weight of their judgment, their fear, dictate the course of another’s life? He didn’t have the answers, not the kind that would satisfy the searching in his soul. But he knew this:  \n\nLove, it was a river, ever flowing, ever changing. To try to dam it, to confine it within the rigid banks of man-made laws, was to invite catastrophe.\n\nThe states, they were the building blocks of this nation, each a microcosm of its own desires, its own demons.  Some, they held fast to the old ways, their hearts hardened by tradition. Others, they embraced the new, their souls open to the possibility of change.\n\nHe wasn’t a man of power, not a king nor a congressman. But he knew this:  A man’s heart, it belonged to him alone. To love, to choose, to find solace in another’s embrace, these were the truest expressions of his freedom.  And if the law could not, or would not, protect that freedom, then it was a law that had lost its way.",
            "The boy huddled close, his breath a thin hiss in the cold.  \"We going to die?\" he asked. The question hung in the air, a bone sliver in the gray silence.\n\nThe man looked at him, the firelight catching the hard angles of his face. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice a rasp. \"Sometime. But not now.\"\n\nThe boy shivered. \"We still going south?\"\n\n\"Yes. We'll be warm.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, a small sound lost in the wind. He stared into the flames, his eyes dark and unblinking.  The man watched him, a cold knot in his gut.  He knew the boy was too young to understand, too young to grasp the bleak weight of their journey.\n\nOutside, the wind howled a mournful song, rattling the bones of the abandoned shack. The world was a canvas of ash and shadow, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay. They had been traveling for weeks, ever since the city had fallen. Since the fire had come.  \n\nHe had seen things, things that would stain his soul. Things he could never unsee. But the boy, he was still innocent. Still held onto a sliver of hope. The man wouldn't allow that hope to be extinguished. He would protect it, even if it meant sacrificing everything else.\n\nHe pulled his threadbare cloak tighter around him, the worn fabric offering little comfort against the cold. The fire sputtered, sending a shower of sparks into the night. He reached out and took the boy's hand, feeling the small, trembling fingers clutch at his own.\n\n\"Do you think God sees us?\" the boy asked.\n\nThe man squeezed his hand, his gaze fixed on the dancing flames. \"He sees everything,\" he said, his voice barely a whisper.",
            "The dust of the world clung to everything. The air itself tasted like ash. The war. It had begun in the gut, a knot of rage after the towers fell.  A rising tide of vengeance. He'd been ready to go, to drown the hatred in blood.  But the blood hadn't washed it clean.  Just stained it deeper.\n\nHe'd seen the truth in the long nights, the hollow echoes of reason lost in the howling wind. They went in blind, fists clenched, hearts aflame. No plan, no map. Just a thirst for retribution.  \n\nAnd the wasteland they'd carved out, it mirrored the emptiness inside. The people there, they were caught in a different kind of war, a war without rules, without reason. A war fought with the tools of survival.\n\nHe'd seen their faces, the weary eyes, the hard lines etched deep by a kind of hunger that couldn't be appeased. They were fighting for scraps, for a sliver of hope in a world gone mad.  And they saw him, a stranger, a bringer of his own kind of chaos.\n\nThey were not savages, not monsters. Just men and women trying to survive in a world where survival meant fighting.\n\nHe'd lost the fire in his belly, replaced by a cold, gnawing understanding. The war had birthed a monster, and they were all feeding it.  He had no answers, only the ashes of what had been.  Only the knowledge that they should have stayed away."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church. It needs changing. Its grip loosens, its flock scattering. Too much clinging to the old ways.  The things they say, they hang like a shroud over the world. Gay marriage. Abortion. Birth control.  The Church stands firm, an island in a sea of shifting sands. Their words, they cut like stones against the tide. \n\nThey say it's the way it's always been, that the world is wrong. But the world keeps turning. People are different now. They yearn for something more, something that doesn't feel like a prison of stone.\n\nThe old men in their robes, they clutch their scriptures like shields. They speak of sin and damnation, but the young, they hear a different song. The song of freedom, of acceptance, of a world where love isn't a battleground. \n\nA world where a man can love another man and call it holy, where a woman can choose her own path, where a body is not owned by doctrine.\n\nThe Church, it whispers of eternity. But what good is eternity if it's built on a foundation of fear?",
            "The word hung in the air, a question mark heavy with the dust of a dying sun. \"Gay marriage.\" He shifted his weight, the words catching in his throat like a bone. The air was thick with the unspoken, the weight of a world where shadows fell long and choices felt like stones dropped into a well.\n\nHe knew some folks, folks who lived lives woven tight with the threads of their beliefs, who'd say it was wrong. A sin, they'd murmur, a stain on the fabric of things.  But he'd seen the fire in a man's eyes when he talked of the woman he loved, the way his hand trembled when he held hers. He'd seen the solace in a couple's embrace, the quiet strength in their shared gaze. Love, he thought, wasn't a choice. It was a wildfire, burning with a fierce and untamed light.\n\nHe thought of the boy he knew, the one with the bright eyes and the laughter that rang like chimes in the wind. A boy who loved his grandpa, loved the feel of the sun on his face, loved the stories of long ago. He thought of how unfair it would be to deny that boy the same chance at happiness, the same right to love and be loved.\n\nHe couldn't say he'd wrestled with the words, hadn't spent nights pondering the scriptures or arguing with the shadows in his mind. But he knew this: love wasn't a thing to be measured, weighed, or controlled. It was a force of nature, a wild river carving its own path. And if a river chose to flow in a direction different from the one expected, should it be dammed or diverted?\n\nHe thought of the federal government, its vast and unknowable reach, its hands always reaching, always grasping. He thought of its pronouncements, its laws, its attempts to shape the world into its own image. And he wondered if love, that untamed, unyielding force, could ever truly be contained.",
            "The air hung thick and low, a shroud over the words. \"Gay marriage,\" he rasped, the word tasting like ash on his tongue. \"Seems like there ain't no good reason not to.\"\n\nHis voice was a whisper against the wind, a frail thing against the silence of the empty field. He shifted his weight, the bones of his old boots crunching in the dust.\n\n\"Folks say it's a threat,\" he went on, his voice barely audible. \"To the family. But it ain't the same, is it? Two sides of a coin, maybe. But the face changes.\"\n\nHe squinted at the horizon, where the sun bled into the dying light. A ragged line of blood against the gray. \"Rights, those are what it boils down to. Property, healthcare... if you're with someone, you should be with them, no matter what.\"\n\nHe paused, a tremor running through his hands. \"They say it's against God's will. But what God? Whose God? The one who sits in judgment from a pulpit or the one that whispers in the wind? You can't legislate faith, not when faith itself is a whisper.\"\n\nHis gaze drifted to the distant city, a hulking silhouette against the fading light. \"There's children involved, too. They need their parents, both of them. Not just the ones who happen to bleed the same.\"\n\nHe looked back at the empty field, the wind whipping his hair. \"This ain't about morality,\" he said, his voice barely a sigh. \"It's about love, about family, about human decency. Ain't that what matters? Ain't that what's worth fighting for?\"",
            "The air in the pharmacy hung thick with the smell of disinfectant and the ghosts of a thousand ailments. He had seen the shadows of death in those aisles, glimpsed them in the pale eyes of the dying and the chalky dust of their bones. And yet, the question before him was not of life or death but of a green, leafy thing, a weed that whispered promises of solace and oblivion.\n\n\"Just because it's outlawed,\" he said, his voice rasping like a rusty hinge, \"doesn't make it poison.\" He paused, the words catching in the dry air. \"The law's a fickle mistress, blind to truth and swayed by whispers.\" \n\nHe saw the unease in the other man's eyes, the flicker of judgment. \"There are things,\" he continued, \"things the law keeps locked away, things deemed dangerous, but used by those who know better. Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets - names whispered in darkened rooms, pills dispensed with measured caution. Yet they ease pain, offer a reprieve from the world's harsh edges.\"\n\nHe let the silence settle, thick and heavy, then leaned forward. \"Marijuana. It's not a monster, not a demon to be feared. It's a whisper in the wind, a balm for the weary soul. To deny its potential, to cling to ignorance, that's the real crime.\"\n\nHe saw the other man's hesitation, the battle being waged in his gaze. \"A gradual easing,\" he offered, \"a lifting of the veil, not a sudden flood. Let people see its face, understand its nature. Then, perhaps, they'll use it wisely, not as a crutch, but as a tool.\"\n\nHe knew the fight was not won, not yet. But he'd planted a seed, a sliver of doubt in the sterile soil of fear. Maybe, just maybe, it would grow.",
            "The church, she's changed some. Evolved, I guess. Not the iron fist it used to be. When I was a child, Sundays meant a dress, shoes, purse - the whole shebang. Matching, of course. Private school, all the friends there, every week the same ritual. Now?  They've got this thing, a teenager mass. Thirty minutes flat.  Folks come straight from the beach, sand still in their hair, kids running late. Jeans, khakis - nobody's in their Sunday best anymore. Not even at the morning service, where I used to be all dressed up.  It's a different world in there now. \n\nThe truth is, that's all I know. The church I grew up in, the one with the stained glass and the smell of incense. Not the politics, not the whispers. Just the pews and the hymns.  Those things, they're the shadow of what else might be out there.\n\nAs for those stories, the ones about the priests... you can't blame the robes, the vows.  There are married men who do those things, too. It's a sickness, a darkness inside. You can't legislate against that. If a man's drawn to that kind of darkness, a wedding ring won't stop it.\n\nThere are other paths, other faiths where a man can be a man and a priest.  Didn't they have that on some show? Seventh Heaven, something like that? A minister, married, with kids.  Maybe that's where they belong, those who want both.",
            "The ash hung heavy, a shroud over everything. The air itself tasted of it, a metallic tang on the tongue.  He thought of the day, September eleventh, the way the world had cracked open and spilled its guts. A lie then, a lie now. Bin Laden, weapons of mass destruction, all smoke and mirrors. They’d gone in believing, or pretended to. The man gazed at the boy, at the innocence etched in his young face, and a bitter taste rose in his throat. He’d seen the truth in Powell’s eyes, the flicker of doubt even as he spun the web of deceit. Malfeasance. A word fit for a king, but a king who’d traded his crown for a shroud of lies.\n\nThe Constitution, twisted and contorted, a broken promise. The Bush men, father and son, fueled by vengeance and the scent of oil. War, a hungry beast, always wanting more.\n\nHe thought of the lake, a mirror reflecting the sky, the air thick with the smell of pine and rot. The oars, a steady rhythm, the only sound. His uncle, pipe clenched between his teeth, a silhouette against the dying light. A day carved in memory, a day before the world went mad.\n\nNow, the country bled, a slow, agonizing death. The boy would grow up knowing only the taste of ash. The UN, a hollow shell, the coalition a patchwork of broken promises.  The Parliament, a stage for the play of shadows, the puppet masters pulling the strings. The Prime Minister, a figurehead, adrift in a sea of chaos. Sadr, a wolf in sheep’s clothing, his fangs bared.\n\nHe closed his eyes, saw the boy’s face, the question in his eyes. Could he answer it? Could he explain the madness, the betrayal, the endless cycle of violence?\n\nThe world was broken. And he didn’t know how to fix it.",
            "The boy sat hunched, the plastic tarp a ragged shroud against the damp.  He spoke in a voice thin as a sparrow's call. \"How I feel about the war in Iraq.\" His words hung in the air, catching on the silence like smoke.\n\n\"Mmhmm,\" I said, my gaze fixed on the ash-streaked road that stretched before us, leading into the grayness.  \n\n\"Just talk into it?\"\n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"Ok, cool.\"\n\nHe hesitated, his eyes fixed on the worn leather of his worn shoes. \"Um, at this point I feel it's kind of pointless. I mean, it ain't even a real war, not declared, you know?\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"And it feels like it was just a way to get back at Iraq, like payback for 9/11. You know, they figured that's who did it.\" He kicked at a loose stone, sending it skittering across the barren ground. \"I don't know the big picture, the details. But it feels like we're stuck there now, trying to build democracy. To make it another America. Like we're taking their land and their oil.\" He shook his head, the movement sluggish, weary. \"But it ain't right. It's making everyone angry.\"\n\nHe fell silent, his gaze drawn to the horizon where the sky bled into the dust. \"You forget things, don't you?\" he said finally, his voice barely a whisper.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, my voice rough. \"You forget what you want to remember, and remember what you want to forget.\"\n\n\nHe looked up at me, his eyes filled with a darkness that belied his years. \"What if it never ends?\" he asked, his voice trembling. \"What if we keep going back and forth, fighting, trying to make it something it's not?\"\n\nI had no answer for him. Only the wind, sighing through the ashes, a constant, mournful dirge.",
            "The air hung thick with the smell of dust and ashes. The man sat hunched in the shade of a bleached oak, its branches skeletal against the gray sky. His words were dry as the land itself, rasping out like the wind through dead leaves.\n\n\"It ain't right,\" he said, his voice a low rumble. \"Not right for the government to push its will on what the Lord's house should stand for. The Constitution, it says clear as day, separation of church and state. They try to tangle them up, they're going against what's been set down, what's carved in stone.\"\n\nHe spat a mouthful of tobacco juice onto the parched ground.\n\n\"They try to make it law, they're choosing one church's creed over another. The Catholics, the Christians, most of 'em, they're against it. But in some of those fancy cities, Boston, they're different. But that ain't the point. It ain't the government's place to decide what's right and wrong for souls.\" \n\nHe looked up at the endless expanse of sky, a bruised canvas of gray and blue.\n\n\"Separation, that's what it's all about. Tolerance. They want to change it, they're going against what the founders built. It ain't about restricting the people, it's about restricting the church. Ain't right.\"\n\nHe took a long drag from his cigarette, the ember glowing like a malevolent eye in the gloom.\n\n\"The government, they shouldn't be sniffing around this at all. The churches, they should be left to their own ways. This ain't about the economy or progress, it's about the soul. And the soul, that's a private affair.\" \n\nHe crushed the cigarette under his boot heel, the red glow fading into the dust.",
            "The air in Iraq hung thick, a shroud of dust and ash settling over everything like a bad memory. The government back home, they hadn't been straight with us, not about why we were there. 9/11, they said. A link to the terrorists. But it felt different, a lie whispered in the wind, a phantom echo of something else. They'd used our anger, our fear, to push us into this mess. 2003, the year the bombs fell, the year the world changed. \n\nWar. I ain't for it, never have been. A preemptive strike? That's just a fancy word for a fistfight before the other guy even throws a punch. Vietnam, they should've learned then. Same mistakes, same hollow victories.\n\nAmerican boys dying, good boys, for what? Just to rip out the heart of a country, leave it bleeding and broken. They talked about democracy, about planting new seeds, but they weren't prepared for the weeds that would grow, the ghosts that would rise from the dirt.  \n\nChaos, that's what they left behind. A vacuum, a power vacuum, sucking in the darkness. And we, we were the ones left to pick up the pieces.\n\nI remember the lake, years ago. My uncle, his straw hat pulled low, his pipe clenched between his teeth. We'd go out there for firewood, the air cold and sharp.  He'd tell me stories, about the old days, about the world before the darkness. He'd say, \"Some things you just can't control, son. The wind, the rain, the tide.\"\n\nBut the war, that wasn't something we couldn't control. It was us. We made it, and now we're stuck with it, like a stain on our souls.\n\nWe're still there, even now.  They talk about peace, about a new beginning, but the air is still thick with dust and ash. And the ghosts, they're still haunting us.",
            "The world, he thought, was gray. Ash-colored, like the bones of some long dead thing. And the bones, they knew. They knew the weight of the world, the burden of it. They knew the slow, relentless push of time. Same as the boy. Same as him.  \n\nHe believed in the rightness of it. This thing, this love, this union. It wasn't a choice, not in the way a man might choose to wear a hat or a coat. This was deeper, woven into the fabric of a man's being. As sure as the sun rose and set, as sure as the wind whispered through the trees.  \n\nHe'd seen it in his own neighborhood, in the quiet corners, the shared laughter, the unspoken understanding. Two men, two women, the same as any other couple, walking their dogs, sharing a meal, their lives a testament to something primal, something ancient.\n\nPolitics, he thought, were shadows. They danced and gestured, but they held no real power. This was a matter of the heart, a matter of the soul.  \n\nThey say it's a choice, they say it's a phase. But the boy, he knew better. He felt it too, the pull, the ache, the yearning. It was in his blood, in his bones.\n\nAnd God, he thought, God had a way of turning the world upside down. He'd seen it. He'd lived it. The world was full of shadows, but there were glimmers of light too. He held onto those glimmers, those fragile sparks of hope, like a man clinging to a raft in a storm.\n\nHe wouldn't let them extinguish the fire in his soul. Not while there was breath left in his body. Not while the boy still held his hand.",
            "The road stretched out like a vein of ash across the gutted landscape. Empty.  Sun a pale disc in the gray sky, barely piercing the dust.  He pushed the cart, the boy beside him, their shadows long and skeletal in the dust.  \n\n\"You think anyone else is out there?\" the boy asked. His voice thin, a whisper against the wind.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said. \"Maybe not.\"\n\nThey walked on, the silence broken only by the scrape of the cart wheels on the cracked asphalt.  \n\n\"What if we were the only ones left?\" the boy asked, his eyes wide with a fear he tried to hide.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his face stained with dust, the lines around his eyes deep and etched. \"Then we'd have to take care of each other,\" he said.  \"That's all there is.\"\n\nThey stopped at the edge of a town, skeletal buildings rising from the ash like bleached bones.  Cars lay overturned, their metal hulls twisted and broken.  A silence hung over the place, thick and suffocating.\n\n\"It's like a graveyard,\" the boy murmured.\n\n\"Everything dies,\" he said, his voice rough. \"Even words. Even memories.\"\n\nThey walked through the streets, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay.  He felt a chill, not from the cold, but from the emptiness. The boy clung to his hand, his small fingers cold and clammy.\n\nThey found a house, its windows boarded up, its roof sagging.  He pushed open the door, the hinges groaning in protest. Inside, the air was stale and thick with the smell of dust and dampness.\n\n\"Someone lived here,\" the boy whispered, his voice echoing in the emptiness.\n\nHe nodded. \"Yes,\" he said. \"But they're gone now. Just like everyone else.\" \n\nThey sat down on the floor, the boy's head resting against his side.  He pulled the boy closer, trying to shield him from the cold, from the emptiness.\n\n\"Do you think there's still good in the world?\" the boy asked, his voice barely audible.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, the question hanging in the air between them.  He didn't know the answer.  He had seen too much darkness, too much pain.\n\nHe closed his eyes, trying to find a flicker of hope in the ashes. \"Maybe,\" he said, his voice a whisper. \"Maybe.\"",
            "The war. It stretched on, a festering wound. A purpose once clear, a noble aim to bring democracy to a land choked by tyranny.  But the light had dimmed. The reasons, once etched in righteousness, had blurred into something indistinct, something like a thirst for power, a hunger to prove dominion. The echoes of a father’s old quarrels, shadows cast by a past that lingered like smoke, clung to the edges of this manufactured conflict. \n\nWas it a just cause then? To free a people from shackles, to offer them the promise of a voice? Perhaps. But the years had bled away the purity. The initial blows, swift and decisive, had spoken volumes.  But the brutal dance of war continued, a macabre waltz with death, fueled by a need to conquer, to dominate. \n\nThe land itself seemed to wither under the weight of this protracted struggle. The coffers emptied, the blood spilled, the spirit broken.  A nation bled while its own children starved. The streets of its cities echoed with the cries of the forgotten, the silent pleas of those left behind. Billions diverted from schools and hospitals, from bridges and roads, poured into the maw of war, a bottomless pit of destruction.\n\nThere comes a point, he thought, when a people must stand on their own. When a nation must learn to defend its own destiny.  The time had come to withdraw, to sever the umbilical cord that bound them to this quagmire.  Let them face their demons, their own internal struggles.  Let them rise or fall by their own choices.",
            "The boy's voice, thin and reedy as a wind through the bone trees. \"Can I ask a question?\" \n\nHe turned from the cracked window, the gray light outside a reflection of the ash inside. \"Sure.\" \n\n\"About that thing... with the internet.\"\n\nHe knew. He could feel the boy's eyes on him, probing, wary. \"Maybe you shouldn't. Some things are best left unsaid.\"\n\n\"But someone saw something. And stopped it. Is that bad?\"\n\nHe leaned back, the rusted springs of the chair groaning. \"The world is full of shadows. Some places you don't want to look too hard.\"\n\nThe boy persisted. \"But if someone saw something bad... and stopped it... is that bad?\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, his face pale and drawn, etched with the same dust that clung to everything in this place.\n\n\"The internet,\" he said, \"is a mirror. And sometimes the things it shows are not meant for human eyes. Some things are better left buried.\"\n\nThe boy was silent. His eyes, dark and watchful, like those of a wild creature.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" he whispered, finally. \"It feels like...\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Like the bad things are always coming. Like we're running from them.\" \n\nHe reached out and touched the boy's shoulder, the flesh cold and thin beneath his hand.\n\n\"We are,\" he said, his voice hoarse. \"But we run together.\"",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, choked with the dust of a thousand broken promises. \"Hmm,\" he rasped, the sound catching in his throat like a bird with a broken wing. \"Um,\" he stumbled, words like stones tumbling down a dry gulch. \"We only have this, and then one more time about the war.  Um, yeah. I mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it, you know. I hate to say it, I hate to join that chorus of voices, the ones that bleat 'I was against it from the start.' Um, I was, but it's not about that anymore. The truth sits heavy now, a stone in the gut –  the consensus, even amidst the whispering halls of power, was that it was a fool's errand. A bad idea.\"  \n\nHe paused, letting the silence stretch, a shroud over the words unspoken. \"The polls are there, you see. United States, Iraq, the world. Seventy-five, eighty percent. They say it was a mistake. Eighty percent of the Iraqis themselves, seventy percent of the men sent to fight, they say it, too.  Pull out, they say. Within the year.  It's been a disaster, from the first breath of that poisoned wind. A festering wound, and now the healing, the pulling back, is another wound in waiting.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he sighed, the sound a crack in the dry earth. \"There's no easy way out in that tangled desert. It's a clash, you see? A storm of cultures, a gulf too wide to bridge. The administration, they don't understand. They think they can force their light on a land that doesn't want it. Democracy, a seed sown in barren ground, choked by the dust of difference. Yes, Saddam was a monster, but was this the answer? To tear down a tyrant and build a phantom in its place?\"\n\nHe looked away, his gaze lost in the dust devils dancing across the wasteland of his words. \" Just quicksand, all of it.  I don't know what to say.  There's no reason to stay.  They'll have their justifications, their carefully crafted narratives, but they're empty words.  Eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, a quarter say now.  We're trying to help them, they tell us to leave. Maybe they know better. Maybe they know what's best for them.\"   He thought of the exodus, a slow, agonizing crawl back into the darkness. \"Gradual, maybe. A year, a little longer, but no more.  We can't be the saviors, not anymore. We're just a stain on the land.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the stink of ash and memory. He knew, yes, knew it in the bone-deep chill that settled on him like a shroud. Gendered judgment, it was a hunger that gnawed at the belly of the world, a sickness that festered in the marrow. Women, men, bound by the same chains, each to their own appointed role. \n\nHe'd seen it in the way the city, a skeletal carcass of concrete and steel, still held its breath, waiting for the day when men would rise again to claim it, to rebuild the monuments of their own making. The women, they lingered in the shadows, ghosts in dresses of dust, their whispers lost on the wind.  \n\nIt wasn't just the women, though.  He saw it in the hard eyes of the men who worked the empty fields, their calloused hands clutching at the tattered remnants of pride. The men who stayed home, tending to the ashes of broken dreams, their spirits withered like the crops.\n\nThey all wore the scars, these men and women, the marks of a world that refused to let them be whole. And the truth was, the world saw them only in fragments, a shattered reflection of what it wished them to be. A woman in a chair, a man with calloused hands, a boy with a book. Nothing more.\n\nHe thought of the young ones, the children who were still learning the language of this broken world. They would carry the weight of these judgments, these invisible shackles, until they, too, learned to wear the masks of conformity.  \n\nBut he saw a flicker of hope in their eyes, a defiant spark that refused to be extinguished. They were the seeds of change, waiting to bloom in the ashes of the old world. They would be the ones to break the chains, to rewrite the story. They would be the ones to build a world where gender was not a cage, where the human heart was free to soar.",
            "The air hung thick and cold. They said it wasn't legal, not really. Decriminalized, they called it. A slap on the wrist, a fine, not the cold steel of the cage. But the fear, the shadow of it, lingered. The marks it left, on your soul, on your chances. It lingered in the whispers, in the eyes of men, in the silence between words.  \n\nThey said it freed up money. Money for schools, for the hungry, for the sick. Money they could use to mend the cracks in this broken world. But the cracks ran deep. The heart of the matter, they said, was the money.\n\nSome places, the old ways held tight. Stubborn, clinging to the fear. But others, they saw the light. Denver, they called it. A place where the wind carried whispers of change, where the old ways crumbled in the face of a new dawn.\n\nMaybe, he thought, it wasn't about the money. Maybe it was about the change. The way it seeped into the air, the way it shifted the ground beneath your feet. The way it made you question everything you thought you knew.\n\nHe saw it in the faces of the young, the way their eyes lit up with a dangerous hope. They weren't afraid of the shadows. They wanted to dance in them.\n\nBut the old ways, they cast a long shadow. A shadow that stretched across the years, across generations. A shadow that whispered of danger, of loss, of a world that could never be fully reclaimed.\n\nHe remembered the lake, the stillness of the water, the smell of pine needles and damp earth. The slow, rhythmic stroke of the oars, the creaking of the boat. His uncle's pipe, the smoke curling in the air. A moment of perfect peace, a memory etched in the heart of the past.\n\nBut the world moved on. The shadows lengthened. And the wind carried a new kind of smoke.",
            "The thing is, yeah, they do things a certain way. Old ways. Been doing 'em for a spell.  Rooted, you know? But the world ain't what it was. Times change. Gotta bend a little.  \n\nThey say church every week, gotta follow the book.  Strict, that's for sure.  And they look down on folks who don't fit the mold.  Folks who ain't perfect. Folks who pray to a different God.  \n\nLike my old man.  Episcopalian.  My Ma, Catholic.  Wouldn't marry them in the Church.  Said it was against the rules.  Hypocrisy, I tell ya.  Love your neighbor, they say. But turn your back on 'em if they ain't one of them. \n\nIt's like the rules are one thing, and the way they live another.  Old ways dying hard, that's for sure.\n\nNow, about those priests...\n\nThey say letting 'em marry would fix things.  Make 'em better men.  But that ain't the root of the problem, is it?  Some folks, they got a sickness.  Don't matter if they got a wife or not.  They gonna do what they gonna do.\n\nIt ain't about marriage, it's about the darkness inside.",
            "The thing is, the way things stand now, it's a knot you can't untie. Church and state, marriage, it's all tangled up.  One hand reaching for the other, grabbing hold, and you can't say if one's right or wrong.  It's a hard sort of question, see?  Something as close as that,  it cuts both ways. \n\nWhat's marriage anyway?  Government business or something else?   If it's a sacrament, shouldn't the church be the one to decide? Like baptism, it's a matter of faith.  No tax breaks, no special treatment from the state. Just two souls bound together. \n\nBut if it's just two people, why the fuss? Why not call it a civil union?  What difference does it make? It's a joining, a commitment. \n\nAnd this whole business with gay marriage... it's like they're trying to draw lines in the sand.  Two souls, just like any other, wanting to join.  Why deny them that? \n\nMaybe if all the states could see eye to eye, they could make it a law.  But a constitutional amendment to ban it? That's just wrong.  The Constitution shouldn't be changed for something like this.  It's not some great moral crisis.  It's just love, plain and simple.\n\n\nNo.  An amendment? That's just too much.",
            "The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and ash. He shifted the weight of the world on his shoulders, a world that seemed to tilt on its axis, forever teetering between light and dark.  The question, it coiled in his gut like a snake, cold and insistent. It slithered through his mind, leaving a trail of unease.  Homosexuality. A word that tasted like brimstone in his mouth.  \n\nHe’d been raised in the shadow of a steeple, bathed in the glow of Sunday sermons.  But the world outside, the world he’d come to know, it was a tangled mess of contradictions. He had friends, bright souls with laughter in their eyes, who walked a path different from his own. A path that led them to solace in each other’s arms, a love that burned with a fierce, undeniable light.\n\nThe law, it was a tangled web spun by men with hands stained with hypocrisy. Should the weight of their judgment, their fear, dictate the course of another’s life? He didn’t have the answers, not the kind that would satisfy the searching in his soul. But he knew this:  \n\nLove, it was a river, ever flowing, ever changing. To try to dam it, to confine it within the rigid banks of man-made laws, was to invite catastrophe.\n\nThe states, they were the building blocks of this nation, each a microcosm of its own desires, its own demons.  Some, they held fast to the old ways, their hearts hardened by tradition. Others, they embraced the new, their souls open to the possibility of change.\n\nHe wasn’t a man of power, not a king nor a congressman. But he knew this:  A man’s heart, it belonged to him alone. To love, to choose, to find solace in another’s embrace, these were the truest expressions of his freedom.  And if the law could not, or would not, protect that freedom, then it was a law that had lost its way.",
            "The boy huddled close, his breath a thin hiss in the cold.  \"We going to die?\" he asked. The question hung in the air, a bone sliver in the gray silence.\n\nThe man looked at him, the firelight catching the hard angles of his face. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice a rasp. \"Sometime. But not now.\"\n\nThe boy shivered. \"We still going south?\"\n\n\"Yes. We'll be warm.\"\n\nThe boy nodded, a small sound lost in the wind. He stared into the flames, his eyes dark and unblinking.  The man watched him, a cold knot in his gut.  He knew the boy was too young to understand, too young to grasp the bleak weight of their journey.\n\nOutside, the wind howled a mournful song, rattling the bones of the abandoned shack. The world was a canvas of ash and shadow, the air thick with the smell of dust and decay. They had been traveling for weeks, ever since the city had fallen. Since the fire had come.  \n\nHe had seen things, things that would stain his soul. Things he could never unsee. But the boy, he was still innocent. Still held onto a sliver of hope. The man wouldn't allow that hope to be extinguished. He would protect it, even if it meant sacrificing everything else.\n\nHe pulled his threadbare cloak tighter around him, the worn fabric offering little comfort against the cold. The fire sputtered, sending a shower of sparks into the night. He reached out and took the boy's hand, feeling the small, trembling fingers clutch at his own.\n\n\"Do you think God sees us?\" the boy asked.\n\nThe man squeezed his hand, his gaze fixed on the dancing flames. \"He sees everything,\" he said, his voice barely a whisper.",
            "The dust of the world clung to everything. The air itself tasted like ash. The war. It had begun in the gut, a knot of rage after the towers fell.  A rising tide of vengeance. He'd been ready to go, to drown the hatred in blood.  But the blood hadn't washed it clean.  Just stained it deeper.\n\nHe'd seen the truth in the long nights, the hollow echoes of reason lost in the howling wind. They went in blind, fists clenched, hearts aflame. No plan, no map. Just a thirst for retribution.  \n\nAnd the wasteland they'd carved out, it mirrored the emptiness inside. The people there, they were caught in a different kind of war, a war without rules, without reason. A war fought with the tools of survival.\n\nHe'd seen their faces, the weary eyes, the hard lines etched deep by a kind of hunger that couldn't be appeased. They were fighting for scraps, for a sliver of hope in a world gone mad.  And they saw him, a stranger, a bringer of his own kind of chaos.\n\nThey were not savages, not monsters. Just men and women trying to survive in a world where survival meant fighting.\n\nHe'd lost the fire in his belly, replaced by a cold, gnawing understanding. The war had birthed a monster, and they were all feeding it.  He had no answers, only the ashes of what had been.  Only the knowledge that they should have stayed away."
