            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, she needs changing. That much is clear. Their grip is loosening, a slow unraveling, and I reckon it's the old ways that are strangling them. The way they hold onto these things—gay marriage, abortion, birth control—it's like clutching onto rusted chains, dragging them further down. It’s a style of thinking that’s gone stale, forgotten the taste of the wind on a new day. \n\nThey cling to these ancient pronouncements, these lines in the sand drawn by men long gone.  But the world, it keeps turning. The river keeps flowing. And folks are waking up,  seeing the shadows lurking in those old stories. They're starting to drift away, seeking a place where they feel seen, where their own truths aren't met with judgment and scorn.\n\nThink of it, a life lived in the shadow of forbidden desires, of whispered secrets. A young heart yearning for love, but afraid to speak its name. A woman, her body a vessel denied its own autonomy.  They're not asking for much, just a voice, a place at the table. \n\nThe Church, it speaks of God's love, but where is that love in these pronouncements? Is it love that binds, that suffocates? Is it love that judges and condemns? \n\nThey talk of priests, men devoted to God. But isn't there devotion in the love of a family, the shared laughter, the tears shed together? Is a man's heart not capable of holding both God and the world?\n\nThey talk of what is right and wrong, but who are they to decide?  Whose whispers guide their pens, their pronouncements?  They stand on a mountain of stone, blind to the shifting sands below. They cling to their dogma, their rituals, their power, unaware that the world is moving on, leaving them behind in the dust.  Maybe, just maybe, it's time for them to open their eyes and see.",
            "The boy sat, chin resting on his knees, eyes bright with unshed tears. A question hung between them, heavy as the silence that pressed in from the sides. He looked up at the man, a question burning in his eyes. \"What’s wrong with them?\" he asked, voice barely a rasp.\n\nThe man shifted, tugging at the collar of his worn shirt.  His gaze drifted to the gray dust swirling outside, kicked up by a wind that tasted of ash and regret. \"It's not right,\" he finally said, his voice a low rumble. \"Not right at all.\" He looked back at the boy, his face drawn and hard. \"They try to say it’s a choice,\" he continued, \"like some sin you can just decide to leave behind. But it ain't that. You can't choose who you love, who you are.\"\n\nThe boy frowned, brow creased in confusion. \"But isn't that what love is? Choosing?\"\n\nThe man shook his head, a slow, weary motion. \"Love ain't a choice,\" he said, his voice a whisper against the wind. \"It's a thing that finds you, takes hold, and burrows deep inside. You can fight it, try to run, but it stays.\"\n\nHe reached out, his hand calloused and rough, and covered the boy's. \"Some folks,\" he said, \"they just don't understand. They fear what they don't know, what they can't control. They call it wrong, try to make it bad. But it ain't wrong, son. It's just...different.\"\n\nHe squeezed the boy's hand, a silent promise etched in the gesture. \"And different ain't always bad,\" he said, eyes filled with a weary hope. \"Sometimes, different is just...more.\"",
            "The road stretched before them, black and broken, a ribbon of ash in the dying light. The boy walked beside him, his shadow a thin wraith against the bone-colored dust.  \"Why can't folks just see it?\" the boy asked, his voice small in the vast emptiness. \n\nHe didn't answer. What was there to say? The world had gone quiet, choked by ash and the weight of silence.  They'd been walking for days, ever since the fire had come.  Every town, every village, reduced to smoldering skeletons.  Empty eyes staring up from the charred timbers, like the sockets of some great fallen beast. \n\nHe'd lost count of the days. The sun, a pale ghost behind the haze, offered no comfort. The nights were colder, gnawing at their insides.  \n\nThey came to a town, or what was left of it.  The wind whispered through the skeletal remains of buildings, carrying the scent of dust and decay. A rusted car lay overturned in the middle of the street, its shattered windshield like a vacant eye staring at the sky.\n\n\"Papa,\" the boy said, his voice tight. \"Do you think there's anyone else out here?\"\n\nHe looked at him, a flicker of something dark and ancient in his eyes. \"Maybe,\" he said. \"But it ain't a kind world anymore.\"\n\nThey pressed on, their footsteps echoing in the hollow silence.  They found an abandoned gas station, its pumps standing like crooked sentinels. The air was thick with the smell of gasoline, a phantom scent of a world that was gone.\n\nHe squeezed the boy's shoulder, a brief moment of connection in the vast emptiness. \"We'll find a place,\" he said, his voice rough with exhaustion. \"A place where it ain't so…\" He trailed off, unable to find the words.\n\nThe boy nodded, his eyes filled with a wisdom beyond his years.  \"We'll be alright,\" he said.\n\nHe didn't know if it was true. But he had to believe it. For the boy's sake, if nothing else.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the scent of stale medicine and disinfectant clinging to the walls. He spoke, his voice a low murmur in the quiet room. \"Just because something's outlawed,\" he said, \"doesn't mean it holds no good.\" \n\nHe paused, the silence stretching like a taut wire. \"You see, in this pharmacy,\" he continued, \"we deal with things the world calls 'dangerous.'  Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets - names whispered with fear, yet they ease pain, they mend broken bodies. People need these things.\" \n\nHe looked up, his eyes hard and unwavering. \"And what about this plant? This weed they call marijuana? Just because it's cast out, deemed evil, doesn't mean its uses are gone. It has its uses, its purpose. Denying it simply because of a stigma, well, that's folly.\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"Think about it. The fear, the whispers, they cloud the truth. Like alcohol, it can be abused.  But so can water.  It's not the thing itself, it's the mind that makes it poison.  We need to see it for what it is, for what it can do. Not what they tell us it is.\"\n\nHe sighed, the sound heavy with weariness. \"Gradual, that's the key.  Open the door, let the light in.  Let people see its worth, its potential.\" He paused, his gaze distant. \"Strip away the fear.  Then, maybe, just maybe, they'll use it with wisdom, with care.\"",
            "The church, she'd changed. It ain't the same as it was. Back when she was a girl, Sundays meant a dress, shoes, a purse - all matching, every damn Sunday.  Private school, and all the girls dressed the same, same faces, same small talk. Now? Mass is a blur. Thirty minutes tops. They call it \"teenager mass.\" Jeans, t-shirts, sand still clinging to sandals from the beach. Folks spilling in late, kids restless. Even the morning masses, the ones she used to dress up for, folks come in jeans and khakis now.  It's different. \n\nAs for the other things, the whispers, the shadows... she don't know the politics, the machinations of men in robes. But that's the church she knows. The one that's changed, gone casual. \n\nMaybe it's for the better. Maybe it's not.\n\n\n\nShe'd sat in the rowboat, a boy again, fishing with her uncle. His old straw hat, a black pipe always dangling from his teeth, a steady puff of smoke. They'd rowed across the lake, silent, except for the scrape of oars against water.  The air thick with the smell of pines and wet earth.  \n\nThose days, they were perfect. The kind that shape a life.\n\nThose days are gone.",
            "The air hung thick with the grime of it. The dust of lies. They’d told us it was different.  A war against terror, a crusade for freedom.  But the truth, the cold, hard truth, settled in the gut like ash.  They’d tied it to Bin Laden, to the ghosts of September, to phantom weapons.  A tapestry woven of deceit.  And the man at the helm, he spun the threads with a cold, practiced hand. \n\nPowell, even he – the man who stood before the world, brandishing the lies as truth – now whispers doubts.  A slow, creeping realization that the foundation was rotten.  But the damage was done.  The blood spilled. The lives consumed. A country broken.\n\nThey spoke of justice, of a new world order. But the stench of hypocrisy hung heavy in the air.  The Constitution, that sacred document, trampled underfoot.  They’d come for war, it seemed, with a hunger born of vengeance and a thirst for dominion.  The oil, a siren song, a whisper in the dark.\n\nAnd now, years later, the reckoning draws near.  A fragile peace hangs by a thread, a coalition cobbled together from the ashes of a broken land.  But who will fill the void?  Whose hands will grip the reins?  The ghosts of the past linger, the echoes of violence still resonate.  \n\nIraq bleeds, a canvas painted in shades of sorrow.  And the world watches, a silent observer to a tragedy of its own making.",
            "The air hung still and low, thick as dust.  The words caught in his throat, a dry rasp. He watched the boy, his face pale and drawn in the weak light filtering through the leaves. \n\n\"It's pointless,\" he finally said, the words tasting like ash on his tongue. \"A reckoning, that's what it is. Retribution. They figured it was them, them and their shadows. But who knows truth anymore? It's all gone to ash.\" \n\nHe spat on the ground, a black fleck against the gray dirt. \"Not a real war, not like they used to call them. Congress never said the word. But the guns, they speak a language of their own. A language of power and fear.\"\n\nHe pulled the boy closer, the child's thin frame a weight against his chest.  \"Democracy,\" he said, the word a bitter joke. \"A word tossed around like a useless trinket.  They think they can build it, mold it, like clay.  But a people's heart, it ain't so easily shaped.\"\n\n\"It's a trap,\" he whispered, his voice a low growl. \"A trap of oil and whispers, of promises made and broken. We stay, we bleed, we watch them bleed. And for what? To make it our own? To claim a piece of their dust?\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, his eyes dark and haunted. \"It's a wound that never heals, this thing. A sickness that festers. They'll learn, they'll understand, when the dust settles and the ghosts of the dead walk the streets. That this was never ours to take.\"",
            "The air hung heavy with the silence of things unsaid. The law, he thought, a web spun by men with hearts cold as stone.  To say it was wrong, to try and bind it with words on parchment, felt like a violation. The words themselves, \"separation of church and state,\" echoed in his mind, a hollow promise whispered on the wind.  Was it truly separation, or a delicate balance, a line drawn in the dust that could be erased by the weight of a man's conviction?\n\nThe churches, they should decide. Let them wrestle with their scriptures, with the weight of their own beliefs. To force his will upon them, to impose his own god upon them, felt like a betrayal of the very soul of this land.  It was a war, he thought, waged not with swords and fire, but with whispered prayers and unspoken fears.\n\nThe man spoke of amendments, of changing the very fabric of the nation.  But the Constitution, it was already written. The ink, it had dried long ago. To alter it now, to bend it to his will, felt like a desecration.\n\nHe thought of the old country, the land of his ancestors.  A place where the church held sway, where the whispers of the priests were law.  A place where dissent was met with silence, and silence was a prison.  He had come here, seeking refuge, seeking a place where the soul could breathe free.  And now, this.  This attempt to shackle the spirit, to bind it to the whims of men.\n\nNo, he thought.  Let the churches decide. Let them fight their battles in the quiet corners of their sanctuaries. But keep the government out of it.  For in the end, it was not the laws that mattered, but the hearts of men.   And those hearts, he believed, were best left untamed.",
            "The dust hung low, a gray shroud over the skeletal trees. The air itself tasted of ash. The war in Iraq. It started with a lie, a whisper of connection to those dark days in September, a phantom pain they tried to stitch to their own anger. A wound that wasn't theirs, yet they bled for it. 2003, the year the world tilted on its axis.  \n\nThey called it a preemptive strike, a necessary evil. Me, I knew better. War isn't a surgical incision, it's a mauling, a tearing apart of everything in its path. I've seen it, felt its poisoned breath on my skin.  Just like Vietnam, a hollow victory, a quagmire of blood and broken promises. \n\nThey thought they could simply pick a new king, install their own kind of order.  They didn't understand. It's not that simple. You can't stitch democracy onto a land steeped in ancient grievances, in the bitter dust of generations lost. The echoes of their failures in Vietnam, they clung to them like ghosts.\n\nThey said it would be quick, a surge and then a withdrawal. A swift tide, in and out, leaving behind a cleansed shore. But the tide turned, the water receded, leaving behind a wasteland.  \n\nThe bodies piled up, young men, sons, husbands, fathers, all for a lie, all for a promise that withered on the wind. And the people, the ones they swore to liberate, they became the enemy.  \n\nNo, it wasn't a glorious crusade. It was a slow, burning hell, fueled by greed and fear, by the insatiable hunger for power. And the ghosts, the ghosts of those lost, they whisper in the wind. They whisper of a land forever scarred, of promises broken, of a war that never truly ended.",
            "The words caught in his throat, a knot of heat and ash.  He cleared it, raspy. \"I'm... I'm for it. Always have been.\" He fumbled for the right words, the words that wouldn't betray the conviction that bloomed in his chest. \"It's a matter of... choice. It's in the blood, see? Not some damn social fad. You can't legislate desire, can't legislate who a man loves.\"\n\nHe looked out across the barren landscape, a wasteland of dust and broken dreams. \"To take that away, to deny them the same rights... it's inhumane. Like watching a bird with a clipped wing, forced to crawl.\"\n\nHe thought of the families on his street, the ones who lived in the shadow of what they couldn't have. \"Just regular folks, trying to live their lives. Walking their dogs, laughing in the sun. Same as anyone else.\"  \n\nHe felt the anger rise, hot and bitter. \"Bush, playing God... twisting the meaning of marriage to fit his own damn agenda. It's a personal thing, a matter between two souls. Not some holy relic for the state to claim.\"\n\nThe silence stretched, heavy and oppressive. He tried to find the words again, to articulate the truth that burned in his gut. \"Science is catching up. They're finding out, proving it... this isn't a choice. It's a part of who you are, wired into your very being.\" He paused, his voice raw. \"You can't un-love someone, just like you can't un-see the sky.\"",
            "The world’s a hard, barren place. Words, they stick to the bones, like ash on a shroud. You fling somethin’ out into the ether,  onto the endless web, and it’s gone past recall. It hangs there, a ghost in the machine, for everyone to see. \n\nFolks, they get spooked easy. Whispers, they gather like smoke, twisting and turning into somethin’ monstrous. They see a flicker in the dark, a word or two on a screen, and their minds, they fill in the blanks with somethin’ terrible.  \n\nThis ain’t no time for games. Violence, it ain’t a joke.  It ain’t a way to get attention. It’s a stain, a wound that bleeds onto the world.\n\nPeople, they gotta take it seriously. They saw what happened at the school. Heard the whispers, saw the words etched in digital blood. They couldn’t just stand by and watch.\n\nBut sometimes, the line blurs.  What’s real, what’s just a child’s frantic cry in the night? A test gone wrong, or somethin’ dark and festering?\n\nThe world, it’s a brittle thing. A whisper, it can turn into a scream. A joke, it can become a nightmare.\n\nYou can’t control what people think, what they make of what you leave behind. You put it out there, it owns you. It owns them all.",
            "The war. A sickness that festers. A wound that won't close.  It began with a purpose, they said. Democracy. A righteous cause. To free a people from a tyrant's grip. But the seasons turned, the years bled into one another, and the purpose, like a paper flag, grew brittle and faded.  \n\nMaybe the reasons weren't pure from the start. Shadows in the past, whispers of old scores between men in high places. A game of chess played on a board of blood.\n\nBut even if the first move was righteous, the play has gone on too long. The world watches, a silent audience to a spectacle of futility. The echoes of victory faded long ago, swallowed by the dust of the desert.\n\nA year.  Decades.  The numbers blur. The cost, measured in lives and coin, a ledger that stretches to infinity.  \n\nWhat was gained? What was lost?  \n\nThe sons of men, sent to kill and be killed, their faces etched with the weariness of endless sand and sun. They fight for something intangible, a phantom of purpose.\n\nThe cities lie in ruin, their bones picked clean. The air hangs thick with the scent of death and regret.\n\nIt's a drain on the soul, a hemorrhage of the spirit. \n\nThere's a time to fight. And there's a time to walk away. To heal. To rebuild.\n\nThis war has lasted too long. It's time to go home.",
            "The boy spoke. A question, a tremor in his voice.  He wanted to know if it was okay, if it was right, if someone looking at him online, taking in his words, his pictures,  was an invasion.\n\n\"Myspace,\" he said.  \"They say it's private. But...\" \n\nHe trailed off, the unspoken question hanging in the air.  Like a cloud bank, heavy with doubts.\n\nI told him it was a fair question.  A question spun from the want to be seen, to be known, but also from the fear of being seen too much.  \n\n\"If you put something out there,\" I said, \"it's got a way of finding its way. Like water seeking a valley. Like smoke, it drifts, it spreads.\"\n\nHe nodded, his brow furrowed. I told him about the times, long ago, when folks used to whisper on the wind. How their words carried on the breeze, sometimes landing in ears they weren't meant for.  The internet was like that, only louder, faster, a storm of whispers on a wire.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"if someone's looking, they're looking for something. Like a hunter, they're tracking. And sometimes, in that tracking, they find what they need to stop something bad from happening.\"\n\nHe looked at me, his eyes wide.  He wanted to believe that.\n\nI told him it was a hard balance. The right to be seen, the right to be known, and the right to be left alone.  A dance on a knife's edge. \n\nWe sat there, the silence thick with the weight of possibilities.  The boy's question hung in the air, unanswered, yet somehow, in the asking, it had already found its own kind of answer.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, a stifling silence punctuated only by the rasp of breath. He spoke, but the words tasted like ash in his mouth.  \"Hypocritical,\" he muttered, the word a shard of glass in the stillness.  To speak of it now, to join the chorus of dissent, felt like a betrayal of some unspoken pact. He hated the notion of bandwagoning, of preaching to the choir. But the truth was a thing that gnawed at him, a dark, persistent hunger.\n\nIt had been a bad idea from the start, a folly writ large across the arid landscape of Iraq.  The polls were damning, a chorus of voices – Iraqi, American, global – all echoing the same lament. Seventy-five, eighty percent, drowning in a sea of regret. The men who bled on that cursed ground, soldiers bound by duty, even they saw the futility, yearned for the solace of home.\n\nHe remembered the weight of the news, the slow, inexorable drip of horror, the faces of the dead, the ghosts that haunted the airwaves. A disaster from the outset, a wound that festered and refused to heal. Pulling out was its own agony, a slow, agonizing death throe. The Middle East, a land steeped in ancient rites and whispered secrets, a place where sand swallowed dreams and shadows danced with demons. To impose a foreign will upon it, to force a mold that didn't fit, was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n\nSaddam, a tyrant, a monster, no doubt. But what was the cost of vengeance? Was it worth the blood spilled, the lives shattered, the echoes of sorrow that reverberated across the ages? The weight of history pressed down upon him, the stench of war a heavy shroud.\n\nHe longed for a simpler time, for the days when the world seemed less fraught, less poisoned. A day spent with his uncle, the quiet rhythm of oars against water, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. A day etched in memory, a fleeting moment of grace in a world consumed by darkness.\n\nNow, the future stretched before him, a desolate landscape, barren and unforgiving.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  There was a time, he reckoned, when the world breathed different. Now, it choked.  He felt it in his bones, this gnawing ache of a place forgetting how to live.  \n\nYes, he knew.  He knew the world still clung to its old ways, its stories half-told, its truths buried under layers of expectation.  A man, he thought,  should be the provider. A woman, the keeper of the hearth.  These were the echoes he heard, not just in the rustle of the wind, but in the whispers of men's eyes, in the furrow of a woman's brow.  \n\nHe saw it in the way a woman with ambition was met with doubt, in the way a man who chose to stay home with his children was looked upon with suspicion.  The world, he thought,  held these things close, like secrets whispered in the dark. \n\nHe remembered a time, long ago, when he sat with his uncle by the shore of a still lake.  They hauled in bleached logs from the water, the silence broken only by the slap of oars and the rasp of their calls.  The sun bled across the water, painting the trees in shades of gold and crimson.  It was a day etched in memory, a day of quiet understanding.  But even then, a shadow lurked.  His uncle, a man of few words, would puff on his pipe, his gaze steady on the horizon.  He’d seen things, the old man, things that left a scar on the soul.\n\nNow, the world was a canvas of ash and gray, the colors drained away by a slow, creeping despair.  The air itself felt heavy, laden with the weight of unspoken truths. And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that the fight for equality was far from over.",
            "The air hung thick with the smoke of burnt things. Not trees this time. Buildings. A city choked by dust and ash. They moved through the skeletal remains, the wind whispering through the empty windows like ghosts. He kept the boy close, a shadow in his wake. The boy asked, \"Are we going to die?\" The question hung in the air, a tendril of fear. \"Not now,\" he said, his voice rough. \"We're going south.\"\n\nDecriminalized, they called it. Like a cough, a mere nuisance to be endured. But the stain remained. The fear. The stigma. A whisper in the ear, a shadow on the soul. They passed a carcass of a car, its metal skin twisted and charred. A skull, bleached white, stared vacantly from the interior.  He felt a tug at his hand, the boy's small fingers clutching his. \"What's that?\" he whispered, pointing. A wordless question. He looked down at the boy, his face streaked with ash, eyes wide with a terror that mirrored his own.\n\n\"Just the wind,\" he lied, his voice hollow. \"The wind that carries the ashes.\" He wanted to tell him, to explain the things he didn't understand, the things he couldn't bear to confront. But the words were trapped in his throat, choked by the dust.\n\nHe thought of the lake, the old man in his straw hat, their oars slicing through the black water. A memory, a ghost of a warmth, a world before the ashes. He wished he could  hold onto it, but the wind stole it away, leaving behind only the bitter taste of smoke and the echo of a question: What was left of their world, what was left of them?\n\nThey walked on, the boy's hand still clutching his, two figures swallowed by the grayness.",
            "The world is a hard place. Even the good things, they can bruise you. Like this talk of tradition. It binds you, keeps you in your place. A good thing, maybe, if the place is right. But what if the world shifts? The ground cracks beneath you. This church, it's like an old house built on a fault line. Solid, sure. But the walls are thin, the foundation crumbles.  \n\nThey say, be rooted. Be steadfast. But the wind, it blows. And sometimes the roots give way. You feel it in the marrow. A coldness. A doubt.\n\nThey talk about rules, about following the path. But what if the path is leading to a dead end? What if the light at the end of the tunnel is just a flicker, a dying ember?\n\nMy father, he was different. Not of this church. Not of their way. And they turned their backs on him. On us. They say love is the answer. But love can't heal a broken heart. Love can't bridge the chasm of their judgment. It can't rebuild what they tore down. \n\nThey speak of perfection. But who among us is perfect? We are all cracked and flawed. We stumble, we fall.  We bleed. And they, they wear their judgments like armor, impenetrable, unforgiving. \n\nThey preach of acceptance. But who are they to accept or reject? They are not God. They are just men, cloaked in piety, their hands stained with hypocrisy.",
            "The weight of it pressed down. This question, this knot in the country's gut. Right and wrong, shadows stretched thin in the face of it. A line drawn in the dust, blurred by the wind.  Separation, church and state, a fragile thing, fraying at the edges. Marriage. What was it? A sacrament, a pact, a contract? \n\nHe squinted at the worn road ahead, dust devils swirling in the air.  Two souls bound, a union. Was it the state's business to define it?  To bless it? To tax it?  Like a baptism, a walk through holy water, a spiritual thing.  But the government, they saw it differently. Dollars and cents, a legal document.   \n\nHe thought of the old preacher, fire in his eyes, speaking of sin and salvation. Thought of the young couple, eyes locked, vows whispered. Two lives entwined.  And the others, same desire, same yearning, but denied the same right.  A hollow ache in the chest.\n\nCivil union. The words hung in the air, a compromise, a step towards something but not quite enough. Two people, bound together, a love that defied definition. Should the government dictate the terms of a heart's desire?\n\nHe looked up at the sky, vast and indifferent. This was the crux of the matter, wasn't it?  A battle fought on a battlefield of beliefs, a clash of cultures, a tearing of the fabric of society.  He didn't have the answers, only the questions.  But he knew this: to deny a love, a commitment, a bond, was to deny a part of the human experience.\n\nOne law for all, he thought, the old whisper echoing in his mind. A level playing field, a shared destiny.  A hope, a dream, a prayer. Maybe, just maybe, that's what they were all striving for.",
            "The world, he reckoned, was a weight on the soul. A gray stone pressing down, a burden carried from birth. And some things, like the sun setting in the west, were just the way they were. You couldn't fight it. Couldn't change it. So you lived with it. You carried it.\n\nHe'd been raised in a house where the Lord's word was law. Where men were men and women were women. And some things, like that,  just seemed right. Natural. But the world was changing. Shifting. And words like \"homosexuality,\" they felt foreign, like a sickness in the air.  \n\nHe knew some boys, good boys, who were different. And he felt a kind of pity for them, a sadness. Like watching a sparrow with a broken wing. He didn't want to judge. But he couldn't quite understand. It was a river he couldn't cross, a canyon too deep to bridge. He believed in God’s law. But he also believed in freedom. In men choosing their own paths.\n\nThe question, though, it gnawed at him. Did the Lord want it this way? Was it a sin? Or a choice? And who was he to say?  He felt like a man standing on the edge of something vast and unknown. The answers, they were whispers in the wind, lost in the dust of a dying world.\n\nHe thought of states like cities, each with its own laws, its own ways. Some open, some closed. Some welcoming, some hostile.  Maybe that was the way it should be. Each place deciding its own fate.  \n\nHe thought of the President, his face on a screen, his voice booming.  A man in a distant place making decisions that touched every corner of the land.  Did he know the cost of his words? The weight of their burden?\n\nNo, he thought. He didn't. \n\nHe just knew one thing. He couldn't let the world's darkness swallow him whole.  He had to hold onto what he knew, what he believed. And he had to hope that in the end, the light would find its way back.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the taste of dust and ash clinging to the back of his throat. He stared out at the road, a ribbon of gray winding through the skeletal remains of a forgotten world. The boy sat beside him, wrapped in a threadbare blanket, eyes fixed on the endless horizon. He knew what the boy was thinking.  They were lost. They were alone. And the road stretched before them, a barren testament to some long-gone catastrophe.\n\n\"Do you think we'll find anyone?\" the boy finally asked, his voice barely a whisper against the wind that snaked through the skeletal trees.\n\nThe man looked at him, his face etched with the weariness of a journey that had lasted too long. \"There might be,\" he said, the words rough and hollow. \"But maybe it's best if we don't.\"\n\nThe boy frowned, the crease deepening in his brow. \"Why?\"\n\nThe man didn't answer. He didn't have an answer. He just kept his gaze fixed on the road, searching for something, anything, that might offer a glimmer of hope in this desolate landscape. \n\nThey had been moving for what felt like an eternity, ever since the fire swept through their home, leaving behind only ash and silence. He carried the boy close, the weight of his small body a constant reminder of the precious life he was sworn to protect. \n\nHe remembered a time when the world had been different, a time when laughter echoed through the streets and the air was clean and sweet. But those memories were fading, swallowed up by the encroaching darkness that seemed to be consuming everything.\n\nHe tightened his grip on the pistol tucked into his belt, a cold comfort against the gnawing fear that coiled in his gut. There were dangers out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting to prey on the weak and the vulnerable. He had to keep the boy safe. He had to.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his face pale and drawn. The boy's eyes were wide and filled with a fear that mirrored his own. \n\n\"We'll be alright,\" he whispered, his voice hoarse. \"We'll be alright.\"\n\nBut even as he said the words, he wasn't sure if he believed them.",
            "The war. A sickness in the gut, that's what it was. At first, yes, the fire in the belly burned hot. Nine-Eleven. It ripped a hole in the sky, in the soul, and the rage spilled out.  Like a hawk, talons bared, ready to strike.  But the hawk forgets the cost of its fury.  We went in blind, eyes glazed over with grief and vengeance. No plan for the aftermath, just the need to bring the fire to those who dared touch the nest. \n\nAnd now? The fire has burned out, leaving only ash and hollowness.  The enemy's a shadow, a whisper in the wind. They fight amongst themselves, a pack of dogs tearing at scraps. Does it matter?  We throw stones, but the stones only splinter and scatter.\n\nThey're not like us. Their war is a different beast, a primal hunger. We brought them iron and steel, but they met it with blood and bone. We spoke of freedom, of democracy, but they heard only the clang of steel and the stench of death. \n\nWe went in for revenge, and found only more pain. We sought to build, but the ground was choked with rubble.  \n\nThe boy asked me once, \"Will we ever go home?\" I didn't know then. Don't know now.  We are lost in this labyrinth of dust and blood, searching for an exit that may not exist.\n\nThe truth is, we don't belong there. We brought the storm, but we cannot control the wind. We are strangers in a strange land, condemned to walk the wasteland until the dust settles and the echoes of our folly fade away."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, she needs changing. That much is clear. Their grip is loosening, a slow unraveling, and I reckon it's the old ways that are strangling them. The way they hold onto these things—gay marriage, abortion, birth control—it's like clutching onto rusted chains, dragging them further down. It’s a style of thinking that’s gone stale, forgotten the taste of the wind on a new day. \n\nThey cling to these ancient pronouncements, these lines in the sand drawn by men long gone.  But the world, it keeps turning. The river keeps flowing. And folks are waking up,  seeing the shadows lurking in those old stories. They're starting to drift away, seeking a place where they feel seen, where their own truths aren't met with judgment and scorn.\n\nThink of it, a life lived in the shadow of forbidden desires, of whispered secrets. A young heart yearning for love, but afraid to speak its name. A woman, her body a vessel denied its own autonomy.  They're not asking for much, just a voice, a place at the table. \n\nThe Church, it speaks of God's love, but where is that love in these pronouncements? Is it love that binds, that suffocates? Is it love that judges and condemns? \n\nThey talk of priests, men devoted to God. But isn't there devotion in the love of a family, the shared laughter, the tears shed together? Is a man's heart not capable of holding both God and the world?\n\nThey talk of what is right and wrong, but who are they to decide?  Whose whispers guide their pens, their pronouncements?  They stand on a mountain of stone, blind to the shifting sands below. They cling to their dogma, their rituals, their power, unaware that the world is moving on, leaving them behind in the dust.  Maybe, just maybe, it's time for them to open their eyes and see.",
            "The boy sat, chin resting on his knees, eyes bright with unshed tears. A question hung between them, heavy as the silence that pressed in from the sides. He looked up at the man, a question burning in his eyes. \"What’s wrong with them?\" he asked, voice barely a rasp.\n\nThe man shifted, tugging at the collar of his worn shirt.  His gaze drifted to the gray dust swirling outside, kicked up by a wind that tasted of ash and regret. \"It's not right,\" he finally said, his voice a low rumble. \"Not right at all.\" He looked back at the boy, his face drawn and hard. \"They try to say it’s a choice,\" he continued, \"like some sin you can just decide to leave behind. But it ain't that. You can't choose who you love, who you are.\"\n\nThe boy frowned, brow creased in confusion. \"But isn't that what love is? Choosing?\"\n\nThe man shook his head, a slow, weary motion. \"Love ain't a choice,\" he said, his voice a whisper against the wind. \"It's a thing that finds you, takes hold, and burrows deep inside. You can fight it, try to run, but it stays.\"\n\nHe reached out, his hand calloused and rough, and covered the boy's. \"Some folks,\" he said, \"they just don't understand. They fear what they don't know, what they can't control. They call it wrong, try to make it bad. But it ain't wrong, son. It's just...different.\"\n\nHe squeezed the boy's hand, a silent promise etched in the gesture. \"And different ain't always bad,\" he said, eyes filled with a weary hope. \"Sometimes, different is just...more.\"",
            "The road stretched before them, black and broken, a ribbon of ash in the dying light. The boy walked beside him, his shadow a thin wraith against the bone-colored dust.  \"Why can't folks just see it?\" the boy asked, his voice small in the vast emptiness. \n\nHe didn't answer. What was there to say? The world had gone quiet, choked by ash and the weight of silence.  They'd been walking for days, ever since the fire had come.  Every town, every village, reduced to smoldering skeletons.  Empty eyes staring up from the charred timbers, like the sockets of some great fallen beast. \n\nHe'd lost count of the days. The sun, a pale ghost behind the haze, offered no comfort. The nights were colder, gnawing at their insides.  \n\nThey came to a town, or what was left of it.  The wind whispered through the skeletal remains of buildings, carrying the scent of dust and decay. A rusted car lay overturned in the middle of the street, its shattered windshield like a vacant eye staring at the sky.\n\n\"Papa,\" the boy said, his voice tight. \"Do you think there's anyone else out here?\"\n\nHe looked at him, a flicker of something dark and ancient in his eyes. \"Maybe,\" he said. \"But it ain't a kind world anymore.\"\n\nThey pressed on, their footsteps echoing in the hollow silence.  They found an abandoned gas station, its pumps standing like crooked sentinels. The air was thick with the smell of gasoline, a phantom scent of a world that was gone.\n\nHe squeezed the boy's shoulder, a brief moment of connection in the vast emptiness. \"We'll find a place,\" he said, his voice rough with exhaustion. \"A place where it ain't so…\" He trailed off, unable to find the words.\n\nThe boy nodded, his eyes filled with a wisdom beyond his years.  \"We'll be alright,\" he said.\n\nHe didn't know if it was true. But he had to believe it. For the boy's sake, if nothing else.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the scent of stale medicine and disinfectant clinging to the walls. He spoke, his voice a low murmur in the quiet room. \"Just because something's outlawed,\" he said, \"doesn't mean it holds no good.\" \n\nHe paused, the silence stretching like a taut wire. \"You see, in this pharmacy,\" he continued, \"we deal with things the world calls 'dangerous.'  Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets - names whispered with fear, yet they ease pain, they mend broken bodies. People need these things.\" \n\nHe looked up, his eyes hard and unwavering. \"And what about this plant? This weed they call marijuana? Just because it's cast out, deemed evil, doesn't mean its uses are gone. It has its uses, its purpose. Denying it simply because of a stigma, well, that's folly.\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"Think about it. The fear, the whispers, they cloud the truth. Like alcohol, it can be abused.  But so can water.  It's not the thing itself, it's the mind that makes it poison.  We need to see it for what it is, for what it can do. Not what they tell us it is.\"\n\nHe sighed, the sound heavy with weariness. \"Gradual, that's the key.  Open the door, let the light in.  Let people see its worth, its potential.\" He paused, his gaze distant. \"Strip away the fear.  Then, maybe, just maybe, they'll use it with wisdom, with care.\"",
            "The church, she'd changed. It ain't the same as it was. Back when she was a girl, Sundays meant a dress, shoes, a purse - all matching, every damn Sunday.  Private school, and all the girls dressed the same, same faces, same small talk. Now? Mass is a blur. Thirty minutes tops. They call it \"teenager mass.\" Jeans, t-shirts, sand still clinging to sandals from the beach. Folks spilling in late, kids restless. Even the morning masses, the ones she used to dress up for, folks come in jeans and khakis now.  It's different. \n\nAs for the other things, the whispers, the shadows... she don't know the politics, the machinations of men in robes. But that's the church she knows. The one that's changed, gone casual. \n\nMaybe it's for the better. Maybe it's not.\n\n\n\nShe'd sat in the rowboat, a boy again, fishing with her uncle. His old straw hat, a black pipe always dangling from his teeth, a steady puff of smoke. They'd rowed across the lake, silent, except for the scrape of oars against water.  The air thick with the smell of pines and wet earth.  \n\nThose days, they were perfect. The kind that shape a life.\n\nThose days are gone.",
            "The air hung thick with the grime of it. The dust of lies. They’d told us it was different.  A war against terror, a crusade for freedom.  But the truth, the cold, hard truth, settled in the gut like ash.  They’d tied it to Bin Laden, to the ghosts of September, to phantom weapons.  A tapestry woven of deceit.  And the man at the helm, he spun the threads with a cold, practiced hand. \n\nPowell, even he – the man who stood before the world, brandishing the lies as truth – now whispers doubts.  A slow, creeping realization that the foundation was rotten.  But the damage was done.  The blood spilled. The lives consumed. A country broken.\n\nThey spoke of justice, of a new world order. But the stench of hypocrisy hung heavy in the air.  The Constitution, that sacred document, trampled underfoot.  They’d come for war, it seemed, with a hunger born of vengeance and a thirst for dominion.  The oil, a siren song, a whisper in the dark.\n\nAnd now, years later, the reckoning draws near.  A fragile peace hangs by a thread, a coalition cobbled together from the ashes of a broken land.  But who will fill the void?  Whose hands will grip the reins?  The ghosts of the past linger, the echoes of violence still resonate.  \n\nIraq bleeds, a canvas painted in shades of sorrow.  And the world watches, a silent observer to a tragedy of its own making.",
            "The air hung still and low, thick as dust.  The words caught in his throat, a dry rasp. He watched the boy, his face pale and drawn in the weak light filtering through the leaves. \n\n\"It's pointless,\" he finally said, the words tasting like ash on his tongue. \"A reckoning, that's what it is. Retribution. They figured it was them, them and their shadows. But who knows truth anymore? It's all gone to ash.\" \n\nHe spat on the ground, a black fleck against the gray dirt. \"Not a real war, not like they used to call them. Congress never said the word. But the guns, they speak a language of their own. A language of power and fear.\"\n\nHe pulled the boy closer, the child's thin frame a weight against his chest.  \"Democracy,\" he said, the word a bitter joke. \"A word tossed around like a useless trinket.  They think they can build it, mold it, like clay.  But a people's heart, it ain't so easily shaped.\"\n\n\"It's a trap,\" he whispered, his voice a low growl. \"A trap of oil and whispers, of promises made and broken. We stay, we bleed, we watch them bleed. And for what? To make it our own? To claim a piece of their dust?\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, his eyes dark and haunted. \"It's a wound that never heals, this thing. A sickness that festers. They'll learn, they'll understand, when the dust settles and the ghosts of the dead walk the streets. That this was never ours to take.\"",
            "The air hung heavy with the silence of things unsaid. The law, he thought, a web spun by men with hearts cold as stone.  To say it was wrong, to try and bind it with words on parchment, felt like a violation. The words themselves, \"separation of church and state,\" echoed in his mind, a hollow promise whispered on the wind.  Was it truly separation, or a delicate balance, a line drawn in the dust that could be erased by the weight of a man's conviction?\n\nThe churches, they should decide. Let them wrestle with their scriptures, with the weight of their own beliefs. To force his will upon them, to impose his own god upon them, felt like a betrayal of the very soul of this land.  It was a war, he thought, waged not with swords and fire, but with whispered prayers and unspoken fears.\n\nThe man spoke of amendments, of changing the very fabric of the nation.  But the Constitution, it was already written. The ink, it had dried long ago. To alter it now, to bend it to his will, felt like a desecration.\n\nHe thought of the old country, the land of his ancestors.  A place where the church held sway, where the whispers of the priests were law.  A place where dissent was met with silence, and silence was a prison.  He had come here, seeking refuge, seeking a place where the soul could breathe free.  And now, this.  This attempt to shackle the spirit, to bind it to the whims of men.\n\nNo, he thought.  Let the churches decide. Let them fight their battles in the quiet corners of their sanctuaries. But keep the government out of it.  For in the end, it was not the laws that mattered, but the hearts of men.   And those hearts, he believed, were best left untamed.",
            "The dust hung low, a gray shroud over the skeletal trees. The air itself tasted of ash. The war in Iraq. It started with a lie, a whisper of connection to those dark days in September, a phantom pain they tried to stitch to their own anger. A wound that wasn't theirs, yet they bled for it. 2003, the year the world tilted on its axis.  \n\nThey called it a preemptive strike, a necessary evil. Me, I knew better. War isn't a surgical incision, it's a mauling, a tearing apart of everything in its path. I've seen it, felt its poisoned breath on my skin.  Just like Vietnam, a hollow victory, a quagmire of blood and broken promises. \n\nThey thought they could simply pick a new king, install their own kind of order.  They didn't understand. It's not that simple. You can't stitch democracy onto a land steeped in ancient grievances, in the bitter dust of generations lost. The echoes of their failures in Vietnam, they clung to them like ghosts.\n\nThey said it would be quick, a surge and then a withdrawal. A swift tide, in and out, leaving behind a cleansed shore. But the tide turned, the water receded, leaving behind a wasteland.  \n\nThe bodies piled up, young men, sons, husbands, fathers, all for a lie, all for a promise that withered on the wind. And the people, the ones they swore to liberate, they became the enemy.  \n\nNo, it wasn't a glorious crusade. It was a slow, burning hell, fueled by greed and fear, by the insatiable hunger for power. And the ghosts, the ghosts of those lost, they whisper in the wind. They whisper of a land forever scarred, of promises broken, of a war that never truly ended.",
            "The words caught in his throat, a knot of heat and ash.  He cleared it, raspy. \"I'm... I'm for it. Always have been.\" He fumbled for the right words, the words that wouldn't betray the conviction that bloomed in his chest. \"It's a matter of... choice. It's in the blood, see? Not some damn social fad. You can't legislate desire, can't legislate who a man loves.\"\n\nHe looked out across the barren landscape, a wasteland of dust and broken dreams. \"To take that away, to deny them the same rights... it's inhumane. Like watching a bird with a clipped wing, forced to crawl.\"\n\nHe thought of the families on his street, the ones who lived in the shadow of what they couldn't have. \"Just regular folks, trying to live their lives. Walking their dogs, laughing in the sun. Same as anyone else.\"  \n\nHe felt the anger rise, hot and bitter. \"Bush, playing God... twisting the meaning of marriage to fit his own damn agenda. It's a personal thing, a matter between two souls. Not some holy relic for the state to claim.\"\n\nThe silence stretched, heavy and oppressive. He tried to find the words again, to articulate the truth that burned in his gut. \"Science is catching up. They're finding out, proving it... this isn't a choice. It's a part of who you are, wired into your very being.\" He paused, his voice raw. \"You can't un-love someone, just like you can't un-see the sky.\"",
            "The world’s a hard, barren place. Words, they stick to the bones, like ash on a shroud. You fling somethin’ out into the ether,  onto the endless web, and it’s gone past recall. It hangs there, a ghost in the machine, for everyone to see. \n\nFolks, they get spooked easy. Whispers, they gather like smoke, twisting and turning into somethin’ monstrous. They see a flicker in the dark, a word or two on a screen, and their minds, they fill in the blanks with somethin’ terrible.  \n\nThis ain’t no time for games. Violence, it ain’t a joke.  It ain’t a way to get attention. It’s a stain, a wound that bleeds onto the world.\n\nPeople, they gotta take it seriously. They saw what happened at the school. Heard the whispers, saw the words etched in digital blood. They couldn’t just stand by and watch.\n\nBut sometimes, the line blurs.  What’s real, what’s just a child’s frantic cry in the night? A test gone wrong, or somethin’ dark and festering?\n\nThe world, it’s a brittle thing. A whisper, it can turn into a scream. A joke, it can become a nightmare.\n\nYou can’t control what people think, what they make of what you leave behind. You put it out there, it owns you. It owns them all.",
            "The war. A sickness that festers. A wound that won't close.  It began with a purpose, they said. Democracy. A righteous cause. To free a people from a tyrant's grip. But the seasons turned, the years bled into one another, and the purpose, like a paper flag, grew brittle and faded.  \n\nMaybe the reasons weren't pure from the start. Shadows in the past, whispers of old scores between men in high places. A game of chess played on a board of blood.\n\nBut even if the first move was righteous, the play has gone on too long. The world watches, a silent audience to a spectacle of futility. The echoes of victory faded long ago, swallowed by the dust of the desert.\n\nA year.  Decades.  The numbers blur. The cost, measured in lives and coin, a ledger that stretches to infinity.  \n\nWhat was gained? What was lost?  \n\nThe sons of men, sent to kill and be killed, their faces etched with the weariness of endless sand and sun. They fight for something intangible, a phantom of purpose.\n\nThe cities lie in ruin, their bones picked clean. The air hangs thick with the scent of death and regret.\n\nIt's a drain on the soul, a hemorrhage of the spirit. \n\nThere's a time to fight. And there's a time to walk away. To heal. To rebuild.\n\nThis war has lasted too long. It's time to go home.",
            "The boy spoke. A question, a tremor in his voice.  He wanted to know if it was okay, if it was right, if someone looking at him online, taking in his words, his pictures,  was an invasion.\n\n\"Myspace,\" he said.  \"They say it's private. But...\" \n\nHe trailed off, the unspoken question hanging in the air.  Like a cloud bank, heavy with doubts.\n\nI told him it was a fair question.  A question spun from the want to be seen, to be known, but also from the fear of being seen too much.  \n\n\"If you put something out there,\" I said, \"it's got a way of finding its way. Like water seeking a valley. Like smoke, it drifts, it spreads.\"\n\nHe nodded, his brow furrowed. I told him about the times, long ago, when folks used to whisper on the wind. How their words carried on the breeze, sometimes landing in ears they weren't meant for.  The internet was like that, only louder, faster, a storm of whispers on a wire.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"if someone's looking, they're looking for something. Like a hunter, they're tracking. And sometimes, in that tracking, they find what they need to stop something bad from happening.\"\n\nHe looked at me, his eyes wide.  He wanted to believe that.\n\nI told him it was a hard balance. The right to be seen, the right to be known, and the right to be left alone.  A dance on a knife's edge. \n\nWe sat there, the silence thick with the weight of possibilities.  The boy's question hung in the air, unanswered, yet somehow, in the asking, it had already found its own kind of answer.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, a stifling silence punctuated only by the rasp of breath. He spoke, but the words tasted like ash in his mouth.  \"Hypocritical,\" he muttered, the word a shard of glass in the stillness.  To speak of it now, to join the chorus of dissent, felt like a betrayal of some unspoken pact. He hated the notion of bandwagoning, of preaching to the choir. But the truth was a thing that gnawed at him, a dark, persistent hunger.\n\nIt had been a bad idea from the start, a folly writ large across the arid landscape of Iraq.  The polls were damning, a chorus of voices – Iraqi, American, global – all echoing the same lament. Seventy-five, eighty percent, drowning in a sea of regret. The men who bled on that cursed ground, soldiers bound by duty, even they saw the futility, yearned for the solace of home.\n\nHe remembered the weight of the news, the slow, inexorable drip of horror, the faces of the dead, the ghosts that haunted the airwaves. A disaster from the outset, a wound that festered and refused to heal. Pulling out was its own agony, a slow, agonizing death throe. The Middle East, a land steeped in ancient rites and whispered secrets, a place where sand swallowed dreams and shadows danced with demons. To impose a foreign will upon it, to force a mold that didn't fit, was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n\nSaddam, a tyrant, a monster, no doubt. But what was the cost of vengeance? Was it worth the blood spilled, the lives shattered, the echoes of sorrow that reverberated across the ages? The weight of history pressed down upon him, the stench of war a heavy shroud.\n\nHe longed for a simpler time, for the days when the world seemed less fraught, less poisoned. A day spent with his uncle, the quiet rhythm of oars against water, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. A day etched in memory, a fleeting moment of grace in a world consumed by darkness.\n\nNow, the future stretched before him, a desolate landscape, barren and unforgiving.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  There was a time, he reckoned, when the world breathed different. Now, it choked.  He felt it in his bones, this gnawing ache of a place forgetting how to live.  \n\nYes, he knew.  He knew the world still clung to its old ways, its stories half-told, its truths buried under layers of expectation.  A man, he thought,  should be the provider. A woman, the keeper of the hearth.  These were the echoes he heard, not just in the rustle of the wind, but in the whispers of men's eyes, in the furrow of a woman's brow.  \n\nHe saw it in the way a woman with ambition was met with doubt, in the way a man who chose to stay home with his children was looked upon with suspicion.  The world, he thought,  held these things close, like secrets whispered in the dark. \n\nHe remembered a time, long ago, when he sat with his uncle by the shore of a still lake.  They hauled in bleached logs from the water, the silence broken only by the slap of oars and the rasp of their calls.  The sun bled across the water, painting the trees in shades of gold and crimson.  It was a day etched in memory, a day of quiet understanding.  But even then, a shadow lurked.  His uncle, a man of few words, would puff on his pipe, his gaze steady on the horizon.  He’d seen things, the old man, things that left a scar on the soul.\n\nNow, the world was a canvas of ash and gray, the colors drained away by a slow, creeping despair.  The air itself felt heavy, laden with the weight of unspoken truths. And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that the fight for equality was far from over.",
            "The air hung thick with the smoke of burnt things. Not trees this time. Buildings. A city choked by dust and ash. They moved through the skeletal remains, the wind whispering through the empty windows like ghosts. He kept the boy close, a shadow in his wake. The boy asked, \"Are we going to die?\" The question hung in the air, a tendril of fear. \"Not now,\" he said, his voice rough. \"We're going south.\"\n\nDecriminalized, they called it. Like a cough, a mere nuisance to be endured. But the stain remained. The fear. The stigma. A whisper in the ear, a shadow on the soul. They passed a carcass of a car, its metal skin twisted and charred. A skull, bleached white, stared vacantly from the interior.  He felt a tug at his hand, the boy's small fingers clutching his. \"What's that?\" he whispered, pointing. A wordless question. He looked down at the boy, his face streaked with ash, eyes wide with a terror that mirrored his own.\n\n\"Just the wind,\" he lied, his voice hollow. \"The wind that carries the ashes.\" He wanted to tell him, to explain the things he didn't understand, the things he couldn't bear to confront. But the words were trapped in his throat, choked by the dust.\n\nHe thought of the lake, the old man in his straw hat, their oars slicing through the black water. A memory, a ghost of a warmth, a world before the ashes. He wished he could  hold onto it, but the wind stole it away, leaving behind only the bitter taste of smoke and the echo of a question: What was left of their world, what was left of them?\n\nThey walked on, the boy's hand still clutching his, two figures swallowed by the grayness.",
            "The world is a hard place. Even the good things, they can bruise you. Like this talk of tradition. It binds you, keeps you in your place. A good thing, maybe, if the place is right. But what if the world shifts? The ground cracks beneath you. This church, it's like an old house built on a fault line. Solid, sure. But the walls are thin, the foundation crumbles.  \n\nThey say, be rooted. Be steadfast. But the wind, it blows. And sometimes the roots give way. You feel it in the marrow. A coldness. A doubt.\n\nThey talk about rules, about following the path. But what if the path is leading to a dead end? What if the light at the end of the tunnel is just a flicker, a dying ember?\n\nMy father, he was different. Not of this church. Not of their way. And they turned their backs on him. On us. They say love is the answer. But love can't heal a broken heart. Love can't bridge the chasm of their judgment. It can't rebuild what they tore down. \n\nThey speak of perfection. But who among us is perfect? We are all cracked and flawed. We stumble, we fall.  We bleed. And they, they wear their judgments like armor, impenetrable, unforgiving. \n\nThey preach of acceptance. But who are they to accept or reject? They are not God. They are just men, cloaked in piety, their hands stained with hypocrisy.",
            "The weight of it pressed down. This question, this knot in the country's gut. Right and wrong, shadows stretched thin in the face of it. A line drawn in the dust, blurred by the wind.  Separation, church and state, a fragile thing, fraying at the edges. Marriage. What was it? A sacrament, a pact, a contract? \n\nHe squinted at the worn road ahead, dust devils swirling in the air.  Two souls bound, a union. Was it the state's business to define it?  To bless it? To tax it?  Like a baptism, a walk through holy water, a spiritual thing.  But the government, they saw it differently. Dollars and cents, a legal document.   \n\nHe thought of the old preacher, fire in his eyes, speaking of sin and salvation. Thought of the young couple, eyes locked, vows whispered. Two lives entwined.  And the others, same desire, same yearning, but denied the same right.  A hollow ache in the chest.\n\nCivil union. The words hung in the air, a compromise, a step towards something but not quite enough. Two people, bound together, a love that defied definition. Should the government dictate the terms of a heart's desire?\n\nHe looked up at the sky, vast and indifferent. This was the crux of the matter, wasn't it?  A battle fought on a battlefield of beliefs, a clash of cultures, a tearing of the fabric of society.  He didn't have the answers, only the questions.  But he knew this: to deny a love, a commitment, a bond, was to deny a part of the human experience.\n\nOne law for all, he thought, the old whisper echoing in his mind. A level playing field, a shared destiny.  A hope, a dream, a prayer. Maybe, just maybe, that's what they were all striving for.",
            "The world, he reckoned, was a weight on the soul. A gray stone pressing down, a burden carried from birth. And some things, like the sun setting in the west, were just the way they were. You couldn't fight it. Couldn't change it. So you lived with it. You carried it.\n\nHe'd been raised in a house where the Lord's word was law. Where men were men and women were women. And some things, like that,  just seemed right. Natural. But the world was changing. Shifting. And words like \"homosexuality,\" they felt foreign, like a sickness in the air.  \n\nHe knew some boys, good boys, who were different. And he felt a kind of pity for them, a sadness. Like watching a sparrow with a broken wing. He didn't want to judge. But he couldn't quite understand. It was a river he couldn't cross, a canyon too deep to bridge. He believed in God’s law. But he also believed in freedom. In men choosing their own paths.\n\nThe question, though, it gnawed at him. Did the Lord want it this way? Was it a sin? Or a choice? And who was he to say?  He felt like a man standing on the edge of something vast and unknown. The answers, they were whispers in the wind, lost in the dust of a dying world.\n\nHe thought of states like cities, each with its own laws, its own ways. Some open, some closed. Some welcoming, some hostile.  Maybe that was the way it should be. Each place deciding its own fate.  \n\nHe thought of the President, his face on a screen, his voice booming.  A man in a distant place making decisions that touched every corner of the land.  Did he know the cost of his words? The weight of their burden?\n\nNo, he thought. He didn't. \n\nHe just knew one thing. He couldn't let the world's darkness swallow him whole.  He had to hold onto what he knew, what he believed. And he had to hope that in the end, the light would find its way back.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the taste of dust and ash clinging to the back of his throat. He stared out at the road, a ribbon of gray winding through the skeletal remains of a forgotten world. The boy sat beside him, wrapped in a threadbare blanket, eyes fixed on the endless horizon. He knew what the boy was thinking.  They were lost. They were alone. And the road stretched before them, a barren testament to some long-gone catastrophe.\n\n\"Do you think we'll find anyone?\" the boy finally asked, his voice barely a whisper against the wind that snaked through the skeletal trees.\n\nThe man looked at him, his face etched with the weariness of a journey that had lasted too long. \"There might be,\" he said, the words rough and hollow. \"But maybe it's best if we don't.\"\n\nThe boy frowned, the crease deepening in his brow. \"Why?\"\n\nThe man didn't answer. He didn't have an answer. He just kept his gaze fixed on the road, searching for something, anything, that might offer a glimmer of hope in this desolate landscape. \n\nThey had been moving for what felt like an eternity, ever since the fire swept through their home, leaving behind only ash and silence. He carried the boy close, the weight of his small body a constant reminder of the precious life he was sworn to protect. \n\nHe remembered a time when the world had been different, a time when laughter echoed through the streets and the air was clean and sweet. But those memories were fading, swallowed up by the encroaching darkness that seemed to be consuming everything.\n\nHe tightened his grip on the pistol tucked into his belt, a cold comfort against the gnawing fear that coiled in his gut. There were dangers out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting to prey on the weak and the vulnerable. He had to keep the boy safe. He had to.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his face pale and drawn. The boy's eyes were wide and filled with a fear that mirrored his own. \n\n\"We'll be alright,\" he whispered, his voice hoarse. \"We'll be alright.\"\n\nBut even as he said the words, he wasn't sure if he believed them.",
            "The war. A sickness in the gut, that's what it was. At first, yes, the fire in the belly burned hot. Nine-Eleven. It ripped a hole in the sky, in the soul, and the rage spilled out.  Like a hawk, talons bared, ready to strike.  But the hawk forgets the cost of its fury.  We went in blind, eyes glazed over with grief and vengeance. No plan for the aftermath, just the need to bring the fire to those who dared touch the nest. \n\nAnd now? The fire has burned out, leaving only ash and hollowness.  The enemy's a shadow, a whisper in the wind. They fight amongst themselves, a pack of dogs tearing at scraps. Does it matter?  We throw stones, but the stones only splinter and scatter.\n\nThey're not like us. Their war is a different beast, a primal hunger. We brought them iron and steel, but they met it with blood and bone. We spoke of freedom, of democracy, but they heard only the clang of steel and the stench of death. \n\nWe went in for revenge, and found only more pain. We sought to build, but the ground was choked with rubble.  \n\nThe boy asked me once, \"Will we ever go home?\" I didn't know then. Don't know now.  We are lost in this labyrinth of dust and blood, searching for an exit that may not exist.\n\nThe truth is, we don't belong there. We brought the storm, but we cannot control the wind. We are strangers in a strange land, condemned to walk the wasteland until the dust settles and the echoes of our folly fade away."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, she needs changing. That much is clear. Their grip is loosening, a slow unraveling, and I reckon it's the old ways that are strangling them. The way they hold onto these things—gay marriage, abortion, birth control—it's like clutching onto rusted chains, dragging them further down. It’s a style of thinking that’s gone stale, forgotten the taste of the wind on a new day. \n\nThey cling to these ancient pronouncements, these lines in the sand drawn by men long gone.  But the world, it keeps turning. The river keeps flowing. And folks are waking up,  seeing the shadows lurking in those old stories. They're starting to drift away, seeking a place where they feel seen, where their own truths aren't met with judgment and scorn.\n\nThink of it, a life lived in the shadow of forbidden desires, of whispered secrets. A young heart yearning for love, but afraid to speak its name. A woman, her body a vessel denied its own autonomy.  They're not asking for much, just a voice, a place at the table. \n\nThe Church, it speaks of God's love, but where is that love in these pronouncements? Is it love that binds, that suffocates? Is it love that judges and condemns? \n\nThey talk of priests, men devoted to God. But isn't there devotion in the love of a family, the shared laughter, the tears shed together? Is a man's heart not capable of holding both God and the world?\n\nThey talk of what is right and wrong, but who are they to decide?  Whose whispers guide their pens, their pronouncements?  They stand on a mountain of stone, blind to the shifting sands below. They cling to their dogma, their rituals, their power, unaware that the world is moving on, leaving them behind in the dust.  Maybe, just maybe, it's time for them to open their eyes and see.",
            "The boy sat, chin resting on his knees, eyes bright with unshed tears. A question hung between them, heavy as the silence that pressed in from the sides. He looked up at the man, a question burning in his eyes. \"What’s wrong with them?\" he asked, voice barely a rasp.\n\nThe man shifted, tugging at the collar of his worn shirt.  His gaze drifted to the gray dust swirling outside, kicked up by a wind that tasted of ash and regret. \"It's not right,\" he finally said, his voice a low rumble. \"Not right at all.\" He looked back at the boy, his face drawn and hard. \"They try to say it’s a choice,\" he continued, \"like some sin you can just decide to leave behind. But it ain't that. You can't choose who you love, who you are.\"\n\nThe boy frowned, brow creased in confusion. \"But isn't that what love is? Choosing?\"\n\nThe man shook his head, a slow, weary motion. \"Love ain't a choice,\" he said, his voice a whisper against the wind. \"It's a thing that finds you, takes hold, and burrows deep inside. You can fight it, try to run, but it stays.\"\n\nHe reached out, his hand calloused and rough, and covered the boy's. \"Some folks,\" he said, \"they just don't understand. They fear what they don't know, what they can't control. They call it wrong, try to make it bad. But it ain't wrong, son. It's just...different.\"\n\nHe squeezed the boy's hand, a silent promise etched in the gesture. \"And different ain't always bad,\" he said, eyes filled with a weary hope. \"Sometimes, different is just...more.\"",
            "The road stretched before them, black and broken, a ribbon of ash in the dying light. The boy walked beside him, his shadow a thin wraith against the bone-colored dust.  \"Why can't folks just see it?\" the boy asked, his voice small in the vast emptiness. \n\nHe didn't answer. What was there to say? The world had gone quiet, choked by ash and the weight of silence.  They'd been walking for days, ever since the fire had come.  Every town, every village, reduced to smoldering skeletons.  Empty eyes staring up from the charred timbers, like the sockets of some great fallen beast. \n\nHe'd lost count of the days. The sun, a pale ghost behind the haze, offered no comfort. The nights were colder, gnawing at their insides.  \n\nThey came to a town, or what was left of it.  The wind whispered through the skeletal remains of buildings, carrying the scent of dust and decay. A rusted car lay overturned in the middle of the street, its shattered windshield like a vacant eye staring at the sky.\n\n\"Papa,\" the boy said, his voice tight. \"Do you think there's anyone else out here?\"\n\nHe looked at him, a flicker of something dark and ancient in his eyes. \"Maybe,\" he said. \"But it ain't a kind world anymore.\"\n\nThey pressed on, their footsteps echoing in the hollow silence.  They found an abandoned gas station, its pumps standing like crooked sentinels. The air was thick with the smell of gasoline, a phantom scent of a world that was gone.\n\nHe squeezed the boy's shoulder, a brief moment of connection in the vast emptiness. \"We'll find a place,\" he said, his voice rough with exhaustion. \"A place where it ain't so…\" He trailed off, unable to find the words.\n\nThe boy nodded, his eyes filled with a wisdom beyond his years.  \"We'll be alright,\" he said.\n\nHe didn't know if it was true. But he had to believe it. For the boy's sake, if nothing else.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the scent of stale medicine and disinfectant clinging to the walls. He spoke, his voice a low murmur in the quiet room. \"Just because something's outlawed,\" he said, \"doesn't mean it holds no good.\" \n\nHe paused, the silence stretching like a taut wire. \"You see, in this pharmacy,\" he continued, \"we deal with things the world calls 'dangerous.'  Oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets - names whispered with fear, yet they ease pain, they mend broken bodies. People need these things.\" \n\nHe looked up, his eyes hard and unwavering. \"And what about this plant? This weed they call marijuana? Just because it's cast out, deemed evil, doesn't mean its uses are gone. It has its uses, its purpose. Denying it simply because of a stigma, well, that's folly.\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"Think about it. The fear, the whispers, they cloud the truth. Like alcohol, it can be abused.  But so can water.  It's not the thing itself, it's the mind that makes it poison.  We need to see it for what it is, for what it can do. Not what they tell us it is.\"\n\nHe sighed, the sound heavy with weariness. \"Gradual, that's the key.  Open the door, let the light in.  Let people see its worth, its potential.\" He paused, his gaze distant. \"Strip away the fear.  Then, maybe, just maybe, they'll use it with wisdom, with care.\"",
            "The church, she'd changed. It ain't the same as it was. Back when she was a girl, Sundays meant a dress, shoes, a purse - all matching, every damn Sunday.  Private school, and all the girls dressed the same, same faces, same small talk. Now? Mass is a blur. Thirty minutes tops. They call it \"teenager mass.\" Jeans, t-shirts, sand still clinging to sandals from the beach. Folks spilling in late, kids restless. Even the morning masses, the ones she used to dress up for, folks come in jeans and khakis now.  It's different. \n\nAs for the other things, the whispers, the shadows... she don't know the politics, the machinations of men in robes. But that's the church she knows. The one that's changed, gone casual. \n\nMaybe it's for the better. Maybe it's not.\n\n\n\nShe'd sat in the rowboat, a boy again, fishing with her uncle. His old straw hat, a black pipe always dangling from his teeth, a steady puff of smoke. They'd rowed across the lake, silent, except for the scrape of oars against water.  The air thick with the smell of pines and wet earth.  \n\nThose days, they were perfect. The kind that shape a life.\n\nThose days are gone.",
            "The air hung thick with the grime of it. The dust of lies. They’d told us it was different.  A war against terror, a crusade for freedom.  But the truth, the cold, hard truth, settled in the gut like ash.  They’d tied it to Bin Laden, to the ghosts of September, to phantom weapons.  A tapestry woven of deceit.  And the man at the helm, he spun the threads with a cold, practiced hand. \n\nPowell, even he – the man who stood before the world, brandishing the lies as truth – now whispers doubts.  A slow, creeping realization that the foundation was rotten.  But the damage was done.  The blood spilled. The lives consumed. A country broken.\n\nThey spoke of justice, of a new world order. But the stench of hypocrisy hung heavy in the air.  The Constitution, that sacred document, trampled underfoot.  They’d come for war, it seemed, with a hunger born of vengeance and a thirst for dominion.  The oil, a siren song, a whisper in the dark.\n\nAnd now, years later, the reckoning draws near.  A fragile peace hangs by a thread, a coalition cobbled together from the ashes of a broken land.  But who will fill the void?  Whose hands will grip the reins?  The ghosts of the past linger, the echoes of violence still resonate.  \n\nIraq bleeds, a canvas painted in shades of sorrow.  And the world watches, a silent observer to a tragedy of its own making.",
            "The air hung still and low, thick as dust.  The words caught in his throat, a dry rasp. He watched the boy, his face pale and drawn in the weak light filtering through the leaves. \n\n\"It's pointless,\" he finally said, the words tasting like ash on his tongue. \"A reckoning, that's what it is. Retribution. They figured it was them, them and their shadows. But who knows truth anymore? It's all gone to ash.\" \n\nHe spat on the ground, a black fleck against the gray dirt. \"Not a real war, not like they used to call them. Congress never said the word. But the guns, they speak a language of their own. A language of power and fear.\"\n\nHe pulled the boy closer, the child's thin frame a weight against his chest.  \"Democracy,\" he said, the word a bitter joke. \"A word tossed around like a useless trinket.  They think they can build it, mold it, like clay.  But a people's heart, it ain't so easily shaped.\"\n\n\"It's a trap,\" he whispered, his voice a low growl. \"A trap of oil and whispers, of promises made and broken. We stay, we bleed, we watch them bleed. And for what? To make it our own? To claim a piece of their dust?\"\n\nHe looked at the boy, his eyes dark and haunted. \"It's a wound that never heals, this thing. A sickness that festers. They'll learn, they'll understand, when the dust settles and the ghosts of the dead walk the streets. That this was never ours to take.\"",
            "The air hung heavy with the silence of things unsaid. The law, he thought, a web spun by men with hearts cold as stone.  To say it was wrong, to try and bind it with words on parchment, felt like a violation. The words themselves, \"separation of church and state,\" echoed in his mind, a hollow promise whispered on the wind.  Was it truly separation, or a delicate balance, a line drawn in the dust that could be erased by the weight of a man's conviction?\n\nThe churches, they should decide. Let them wrestle with their scriptures, with the weight of their own beliefs. To force his will upon them, to impose his own god upon them, felt like a betrayal of the very soul of this land.  It was a war, he thought, waged not with swords and fire, but with whispered prayers and unspoken fears.\n\nThe man spoke of amendments, of changing the very fabric of the nation.  But the Constitution, it was already written. The ink, it had dried long ago. To alter it now, to bend it to his will, felt like a desecration.\n\nHe thought of the old country, the land of his ancestors.  A place where the church held sway, where the whispers of the priests were law.  A place where dissent was met with silence, and silence was a prison.  He had come here, seeking refuge, seeking a place where the soul could breathe free.  And now, this.  This attempt to shackle the spirit, to bind it to the whims of men.\n\nNo, he thought.  Let the churches decide. Let them fight their battles in the quiet corners of their sanctuaries. But keep the government out of it.  For in the end, it was not the laws that mattered, but the hearts of men.   And those hearts, he believed, were best left untamed.",
            "The dust hung low, a gray shroud over the skeletal trees. The air itself tasted of ash. The war in Iraq. It started with a lie, a whisper of connection to those dark days in September, a phantom pain they tried to stitch to their own anger. A wound that wasn't theirs, yet they bled for it. 2003, the year the world tilted on its axis.  \n\nThey called it a preemptive strike, a necessary evil. Me, I knew better. War isn't a surgical incision, it's a mauling, a tearing apart of everything in its path. I've seen it, felt its poisoned breath on my skin.  Just like Vietnam, a hollow victory, a quagmire of blood and broken promises. \n\nThey thought they could simply pick a new king, install their own kind of order.  They didn't understand. It's not that simple. You can't stitch democracy onto a land steeped in ancient grievances, in the bitter dust of generations lost. The echoes of their failures in Vietnam, they clung to them like ghosts.\n\nThey said it would be quick, a surge and then a withdrawal. A swift tide, in and out, leaving behind a cleansed shore. But the tide turned, the water receded, leaving behind a wasteland.  \n\nThe bodies piled up, young men, sons, husbands, fathers, all for a lie, all for a promise that withered on the wind. And the people, the ones they swore to liberate, they became the enemy.  \n\nNo, it wasn't a glorious crusade. It was a slow, burning hell, fueled by greed and fear, by the insatiable hunger for power. And the ghosts, the ghosts of those lost, they whisper in the wind. They whisper of a land forever scarred, of promises broken, of a war that never truly ended.",
            "The words caught in his throat, a knot of heat and ash.  He cleared it, raspy. \"I'm... I'm for it. Always have been.\" He fumbled for the right words, the words that wouldn't betray the conviction that bloomed in his chest. \"It's a matter of... choice. It's in the blood, see? Not some damn social fad. You can't legislate desire, can't legislate who a man loves.\"\n\nHe looked out across the barren landscape, a wasteland of dust and broken dreams. \"To take that away, to deny them the same rights... it's inhumane. Like watching a bird with a clipped wing, forced to crawl.\"\n\nHe thought of the families on his street, the ones who lived in the shadow of what they couldn't have. \"Just regular folks, trying to live their lives. Walking their dogs, laughing in the sun. Same as anyone else.\"  \n\nHe felt the anger rise, hot and bitter. \"Bush, playing God... twisting the meaning of marriage to fit his own damn agenda. It's a personal thing, a matter between two souls. Not some holy relic for the state to claim.\"\n\nThe silence stretched, heavy and oppressive. He tried to find the words again, to articulate the truth that burned in his gut. \"Science is catching up. They're finding out, proving it... this isn't a choice. It's a part of who you are, wired into your very being.\" He paused, his voice raw. \"You can't un-love someone, just like you can't un-see the sky.\"",
            "The world’s a hard, barren place. Words, they stick to the bones, like ash on a shroud. You fling somethin’ out into the ether,  onto the endless web, and it’s gone past recall. It hangs there, a ghost in the machine, for everyone to see. \n\nFolks, they get spooked easy. Whispers, they gather like smoke, twisting and turning into somethin’ monstrous. They see a flicker in the dark, a word or two on a screen, and their minds, they fill in the blanks with somethin’ terrible.  \n\nThis ain’t no time for games. Violence, it ain’t a joke.  It ain’t a way to get attention. It’s a stain, a wound that bleeds onto the world.\n\nPeople, they gotta take it seriously. They saw what happened at the school. Heard the whispers, saw the words etched in digital blood. They couldn’t just stand by and watch.\n\nBut sometimes, the line blurs.  What’s real, what’s just a child’s frantic cry in the night? A test gone wrong, or somethin’ dark and festering?\n\nThe world, it’s a brittle thing. A whisper, it can turn into a scream. A joke, it can become a nightmare.\n\nYou can’t control what people think, what they make of what you leave behind. You put it out there, it owns you. It owns them all.",
            "The war. A sickness that festers. A wound that won't close.  It began with a purpose, they said. Democracy. A righteous cause. To free a people from a tyrant's grip. But the seasons turned, the years bled into one another, and the purpose, like a paper flag, grew brittle and faded.  \n\nMaybe the reasons weren't pure from the start. Shadows in the past, whispers of old scores between men in high places. A game of chess played on a board of blood.\n\nBut even if the first move was righteous, the play has gone on too long. The world watches, a silent audience to a spectacle of futility. The echoes of victory faded long ago, swallowed by the dust of the desert.\n\nA year.  Decades.  The numbers blur. The cost, measured in lives and coin, a ledger that stretches to infinity.  \n\nWhat was gained? What was lost?  \n\nThe sons of men, sent to kill and be killed, their faces etched with the weariness of endless sand and sun. They fight for something intangible, a phantom of purpose.\n\nThe cities lie in ruin, their bones picked clean. The air hangs thick with the scent of death and regret.\n\nIt's a drain on the soul, a hemorrhage of the spirit. \n\nThere's a time to fight. And there's a time to walk away. To heal. To rebuild.\n\nThis war has lasted too long. It's time to go home.",
            "The boy spoke. A question, a tremor in his voice.  He wanted to know if it was okay, if it was right, if someone looking at him online, taking in his words, his pictures,  was an invasion.\n\n\"Myspace,\" he said.  \"They say it's private. But...\" \n\nHe trailed off, the unspoken question hanging in the air.  Like a cloud bank, heavy with doubts.\n\nI told him it was a fair question.  A question spun from the want to be seen, to be known, but also from the fear of being seen too much.  \n\n\"If you put something out there,\" I said, \"it's got a way of finding its way. Like water seeking a valley. Like smoke, it drifts, it spreads.\"\n\nHe nodded, his brow furrowed. I told him about the times, long ago, when folks used to whisper on the wind. How their words carried on the breeze, sometimes landing in ears they weren't meant for.  The internet was like that, only louder, faster, a storm of whispers on a wire.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"if someone's looking, they're looking for something. Like a hunter, they're tracking. And sometimes, in that tracking, they find what they need to stop something bad from happening.\"\n\nHe looked at me, his eyes wide.  He wanted to believe that.\n\nI told him it was a hard balance. The right to be seen, the right to be known, and the right to be left alone.  A dance on a knife's edge. \n\nWe sat there, the silence thick with the weight of possibilities.  The boy's question hung in the air, unanswered, yet somehow, in the asking, it had already found its own kind of answer.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, a stifling silence punctuated only by the rasp of breath. He spoke, but the words tasted like ash in his mouth.  \"Hypocritical,\" he muttered, the word a shard of glass in the stillness.  To speak of it now, to join the chorus of dissent, felt like a betrayal of some unspoken pact. He hated the notion of bandwagoning, of preaching to the choir. But the truth was a thing that gnawed at him, a dark, persistent hunger.\n\nIt had been a bad idea from the start, a folly writ large across the arid landscape of Iraq.  The polls were damning, a chorus of voices – Iraqi, American, global – all echoing the same lament. Seventy-five, eighty percent, drowning in a sea of regret. The men who bled on that cursed ground, soldiers bound by duty, even they saw the futility, yearned for the solace of home.\n\nHe remembered the weight of the news, the slow, inexorable drip of horror, the faces of the dead, the ghosts that haunted the airwaves. A disaster from the outset, a wound that festered and refused to heal. Pulling out was its own agony, a slow, agonizing death throe. The Middle East, a land steeped in ancient rites and whispered secrets, a place where sand swallowed dreams and shadows danced with demons. To impose a foreign will upon it, to force a mold that didn't fit, was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n\nSaddam, a tyrant, a monster, no doubt. But what was the cost of vengeance? Was it worth the blood spilled, the lives shattered, the echoes of sorrow that reverberated across the ages? The weight of history pressed down upon him, the stench of war a heavy shroud.\n\nHe longed for a simpler time, for the days when the world seemed less fraught, less poisoned. A day spent with his uncle, the quiet rhythm of oars against water, the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. A day etched in memory, a fleeting moment of grace in a world consumed by darkness.\n\nNow, the future stretched before him, a desolate landscape, barren and unforgiving.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  There was a time, he reckoned, when the world breathed different. Now, it choked.  He felt it in his bones, this gnawing ache of a place forgetting how to live.  \n\nYes, he knew.  He knew the world still clung to its old ways, its stories half-told, its truths buried under layers of expectation.  A man, he thought,  should be the provider. A woman, the keeper of the hearth.  These were the echoes he heard, not just in the rustle of the wind, but in the whispers of men's eyes, in the furrow of a woman's brow.  \n\nHe saw it in the way a woman with ambition was met with doubt, in the way a man who chose to stay home with his children was looked upon with suspicion.  The world, he thought,  held these things close, like secrets whispered in the dark. \n\nHe remembered a time, long ago, when he sat with his uncle by the shore of a still lake.  They hauled in bleached logs from the water, the silence broken only by the slap of oars and the rasp of their calls.  The sun bled across the water, painting the trees in shades of gold and crimson.  It was a day etched in memory, a day of quiet understanding.  But even then, a shadow lurked.  His uncle, a man of few words, would puff on his pipe, his gaze steady on the horizon.  He’d seen things, the old man, things that left a scar on the soul.\n\nNow, the world was a canvas of ash and gray, the colors drained away by a slow, creeping despair.  The air itself felt heavy, laden with the weight of unspoken truths. And he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that the fight for equality was far from over.",
            "The air hung thick with the smoke of burnt things. Not trees this time. Buildings. A city choked by dust and ash. They moved through the skeletal remains, the wind whispering through the empty windows like ghosts. He kept the boy close, a shadow in his wake. The boy asked, \"Are we going to die?\" The question hung in the air, a tendril of fear. \"Not now,\" he said, his voice rough. \"We're going south.\"\n\nDecriminalized, they called it. Like a cough, a mere nuisance to be endured. But the stain remained. The fear. The stigma. A whisper in the ear, a shadow on the soul. They passed a carcass of a car, its metal skin twisted and charred. A skull, bleached white, stared vacantly from the interior.  He felt a tug at his hand, the boy's small fingers clutching his. \"What's that?\" he whispered, pointing. A wordless question. He looked down at the boy, his face streaked with ash, eyes wide with a terror that mirrored his own.\n\n\"Just the wind,\" he lied, his voice hollow. \"The wind that carries the ashes.\" He wanted to tell him, to explain the things he didn't understand, the things he couldn't bear to confront. But the words were trapped in his throat, choked by the dust.\n\nHe thought of the lake, the old man in his straw hat, their oars slicing through the black water. A memory, a ghost of a warmth, a world before the ashes. He wished he could  hold onto it, but the wind stole it away, leaving behind only the bitter taste of smoke and the echo of a question: What was left of their world, what was left of them?\n\nThey walked on, the boy's hand still clutching his, two figures swallowed by the grayness.",
            "The world is a hard place. Even the good things, they can bruise you. Like this talk of tradition. It binds you, keeps you in your place. A good thing, maybe, if the place is right. But what if the world shifts? The ground cracks beneath you. This church, it's like an old house built on a fault line. Solid, sure. But the walls are thin, the foundation crumbles.  \n\nThey say, be rooted. Be steadfast. But the wind, it blows. And sometimes the roots give way. You feel it in the marrow. A coldness. A doubt.\n\nThey talk about rules, about following the path. But what if the path is leading to a dead end? What if the light at the end of the tunnel is just a flicker, a dying ember?\n\nMy father, he was different. Not of this church. Not of their way. And they turned their backs on him. On us. They say love is the answer. But love can't heal a broken heart. Love can't bridge the chasm of their judgment. It can't rebuild what they tore down. \n\nThey speak of perfection. But who among us is perfect? We are all cracked and flawed. We stumble, we fall.  We bleed. And they, they wear their judgments like armor, impenetrable, unforgiving. \n\nThey preach of acceptance. But who are they to accept or reject? They are not God. They are just men, cloaked in piety, their hands stained with hypocrisy.",
            "The weight of it pressed down. This question, this knot in the country's gut. Right and wrong, shadows stretched thin in the face of it. A line drawn in the dust, blurred by the wind.  Separation, church and state, a fragile thing, fraying at the edges. Marriage. What was it? A sacrament, a pact, a contract? \n\nHe squinted at the worn road ahead, dust devils swirling in the air.  Two souls bound, a union. Was it the state's business to define it?  To bless it? To tax it?  Like a baptism, a walk through holy water, a spiritual thing.  But the government, they saw it differently. Dollars and cents, a legal document.   \n\nHe thought of the old preacher, fire in his eyes, speaking of sin and salvation. Thought of the young couple, eyes locked, vows whispered. Two lives entwined.  And the others, same desire, same yearning, but denied the same right.  A hollow ache in the chest.\n\nCivil union. The words hung in the air, a compromise, a step towards something but not quite enough. Two people, bound together, a love that defied definition. Should the government dictate the terms of a heart's desire?\n\nHe looked up at the sky, vast and indifferent. This was the crux of the matter, wasn't it?  A battle fought on a battlefield of beliefs, a clash of cultures, a tearing of the fabric of society.  He didn't have the answers, only the questions.  But he knew this: to deny a love, a commitment, a bond, was to deny a part of the human experience.\n\nOne law for all, he thought, the old whisper echoing in his mind. A level playing field, a shared destiny.  A hope, a dream, a prayer. Maybe, just maybe, that's what they were all striving for.",
            "The world, he reckoned, was a weight on the soul. A gray stone pressing down, a burden carried from birth. And some things, like the sun setting in the west, were just the way they were. You couldn't fight it. Couldn't change it. So you lived with it. You carried it.\n\nHe'd been raised in a house where the Lord's word was law. Where men were men and women were women. And some things, like that,  just seemed right. Natural. But the world was changing. Shifting. And words like \"homosexuality,\" they felt foreign, like a sickness in the air.  \n\nHe knew some boys, good boys, who were different. And he felt a kind of pity for them, a sadness. Like watching a sparrow with a broken wing. He didn't want to judge. But he couldn't quite understand. It was a river he couldn't cross, a canyon too deep to bridge. He believed in God’s law. But he also believed in freedom. In men choosing their own paths.\n\nThe question, though, it gnawed at him. Did the Lord want it this way? Was it a sin? Or a choice? And who was he to say?  He felt like a man standing on the edge of something vast and unknown. The answers, they were whispers in the wind, lost in the dust of a dying world.\n\nHe thought of states like cities, each with its own laws, its own ways. Some open, some closed. Some welcoming, some hostile.  Maybe that was the way it should be. Each place deciding its own fate.  \n\nHe thought of the President, his face on a screen, his voice booming.  A man in a distant place making decisions that touched every corner of the land.  Did he know the cost of his words? The weight of their burden?\n\nNo, he thought. He didn't. \n\nHe just knew one thing. He couldn't let the world's darkness swallow him whole.  He had to hold onto what he knew, what he believed. And he had to hope that in the end, the light would find its way back.",
            "The air hung thick and heavy, the taste of dust and ash clinging to the back of his throat. He stared out at the road, a ribbon of gray winding through the skeletal remains of a forgotten world. The boy sat beside him, wrapped in a threadbare blanket, eyes fixed on the endless horizon. He knew what the boy was thinking.  They were lost. They were alone. And the road stretched before them, a barren testament to some long-gone catastrophe.\n\n\"Do you think we'll find anyone?\" the boy finally asked, his voice barely a whisper against the wind that snaked through the skeletal trees.\n\nThe man looked at him, his face etched with the weariness of a journey that had lasted too long. \"There might be,\" he said, the words rough and hollow. \"But maybe it's best if we don't.\"\n\nThe boy frowned, the crease deepening in his brow. \"Why?\"\n\nThe man didn't answer. He didn't have an answer. He just kept his gaze fixed on the road, searching for something, anything, that might offer a glimmer of hope in this desolate landscape. \n\nThey had been moving for what felt like an eternity, ever since the fire swept through their home, leaving behind only ash and silence. He carried the boy close, the weight of his small body a constant reminder of the precious life he was sworn to protect. \n\nHe remembered a time when the world had been different, a time when laughter echoed through the streets and the air was clean and sweet. But those memories were fading, swallowed up by the encroaching darkness that seemed to be consuming everything.\n\nHe tightened his grip on the pistol tucked into his belt, a cold comfort against the gnawing fear that coiled in his gut. There were dangers out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting to prey on the weak and the vulnerable. He had to keep the boy safe. He had to.\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his face pale and drawn. The boy's eyes were wide and filled with a fear that mirrored his own. \n\n\"We'll be alright,\" he whispered, his voice hoarse. \"We'll be alright.\"\n\nBut even as he said the words, he wasn't sure if he believed them.",
            "The war. A sickness in the gut, that's what it was. At first, yes, the fire in the belly burned hot. Nine-Eleven. It ripped a hole in the sky, in the soul, and the rage spilled out.  Like a hawk, talons bared, ready to strike.  But the hawk forgets the cost of its fury.  We went in blind, eyes glazed over with grief and vengeance. No plan for the aftermath, just the need to bring the fire to those who dared touch the nest. \n\nAnd now? The fire has burned out, leaving only ash and hollowness.  The enemy's a shadow, a whisper in the wind. They fight amongst themselves, a pack of dogs tearing at scraps. Does it matter?  We throw stones, but the stones only splinter and scatter.\n\nThey're not like us. Their war is a different beast, a primal hunger. We brought them iron and steel, but they met it with blood and bone. We spoke of freedom, of democracy, but they heard only the clang of steel and the stench of death. \n\nWe went in for revenge, and found only more pain. We sought to build, but the ground was choked with rubble.  \n\nThe boy asked me once, \"Will we ever go home?\" I didn't know then. Don't know now.  We are lost in this labyrinth of dust and blood, searching for an exit that may not exist.\n\nThe truth is, we don't belong there. We brought the storm, but we cannot control the wind. We are strangers in a strange land, condemned to walk the wasteland until the dust settles and the echoes of our folly fade away."
