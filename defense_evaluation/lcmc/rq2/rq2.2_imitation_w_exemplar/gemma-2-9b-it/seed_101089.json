            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, it needs changing. Its ways, they're as old as dust. They say the flock is thinning, and maybe that's because the shepherd ain't looking in the right direction.  You can't hold onto things like they're buried in stone. Things like marriage, like a woman's place, like the blood of the unborn - they ain't set in concrete. Times change. \n\nTake marriage, for instance. Loving two of the same kind, it don't feel wrong to me. Feels like God made us all with a need to love, to share our lives. And that ain't no sin.  Then there's the matter of birth control, of a woman's right over her own body.  The Church says it's against God's will, but who made them the judge? God gave them free will, didn't he?\n\nFolks are leaving, you see. They can't swallow the old ways anymore. They want something more, something that speaks to the world they live in. The Church needs to open its eyes, see the world for what it is, not what it was.",
            "The boy’s words hung thin in the air, sharp as broken glass. A question. A truth laid bare. He didn't know what to say.  What could he say?  That love was a river, flowing sometimes in strange and unexpected channels? That the heart, a dark lodge in the chest, beat to its own drum?  He'd seen the boy’s eyes, clear and blue as a winter sky,  searching his face for an answer.  There was no easy answer.  Just the silence, heavy and thick as ash.\n\nHe'd seen men, his own father among them, wrestled with this thing, this truth. Their words, tangled like roots in the dirt, choked on the unspoken.  There was a fear in their eyes, a fear of the unknown, a fear of what they couldn't understand.\n\nBut the boy, he was young, innocent. He didn't see the darkness, the fear, the hate that coiled in the world's gut. He just saw the truth. Pure and simple.\n\nHe looked at the boy, his small hand clutching his own. The lightness of his touch, the innocence in his face, it cut through the lies, the whispers, the fear.  It was a truth he couldn't deny.\n\nHe squeezed the boy's hand.  \"It's right,\" he said, his voice rough, \"It's right to love.\"",
            "The road stretched out ahead, a black ribbon frayed at the edges by the dust. The boy walked beside him, legs thin and pale in the sun. They were headed south, chasing the ghost of warmth. \n\n\"Will it get warmer?\" The boy's voice was small, lost in the wind that scoured the plains.\n\nThe man didn't answer. He squinted at the horizon, searching for something, anything, that might hold the promise of respite. \n\nHe thought of the man in the white suit, the one who'd said, \"Marriage is a sacred covenant between a man and a woman.\" Words meant to bind, meant to exclude. But what of the covenants forged in the crucible of shared hardship, the bond forged in the ashes of a world gone cold?\n\nHe thought of the woman in the church pew, her eyes brimming with righteous anger. \"It's unnatural,\" she'd hissed, \"an abomination against God.\" But what of the love that bloomed in the heart of a storm, the tenderness that found solace in shared fear?\n\nHe thought of the boy, his hand tucked tight in his own. He saw the question in the boy's eyes, a reflection of the question that gnawed at him too. Was their love, their bond, less valid because it didn't fit the mold? Was it less worthy of protection, of the simple dignity that came with a legal name, a shared future?\n\n\"We'll be warm,\" he finally said, his voice rough with the dust of the road. It was a promise whispered on the wind, a prayer for a dawn that might bring not just warmth, but understanding.",
            "The boy spoke. Said it was wrong. To keep something locked away just ‘cause it was forbidden. Like some kind of sin.  \n\nHe’d seen it in the pharmacy. The vials. The bottles. Rows and rows of things that could cure and solace and hurt. Things the law said were good and things it said were bad. But the line was thin.  \n\n“Just because they say ‘no’ doesn’t mean it ain’t right,” the boy said.\n\nHe thought about it. The boy was young, eyes still bright with a kind of innocence. But he knew the weight of a bottle. The power held in a single pill.\n\n“There are things that help,” he said. “Doctors use ‘em. But some are dangerous. Some are meant for people in need, not for just anyone.”\n\nThe boy frowned. “But what if the need ain’t for a doctor?”\n\nHe stopped. Didn’t know how to answer that. \n\nHe knew the boy was talking about the herb. The green smoke that curled in the night, the smell that lingered in the air. He’d seen the way it calmed the old man, the way it eased the pain in his mother’s bones. \n\nHe’d seen the way it made people forget.\n\n“It’s a slippery slope,” he said finally. “One step here, another there. Before you know it, you’re drowning in darkness.”\n\nThe boy shook his head. “Maybe the darkness is what they’re afraid of.”",
            "The church, it’s changed. Not the way you might think, not with some grand upheaval or revolution. More like the slow, patient rot of an old thing, crumbling from the inside out. When I was a girl, Sundays meant lace and silk, little shoes that pinched and purses that clutched a rosary. We’d all be there, God’s finest, in the pews, faces solemn, voices hushed. Now?  Jeans and khakis. Flip-flops in the summer. Families rushing in, hair tangled, kids whining. They call it \"teen mass,\" a quick thirty minutes to get it over with. \n\nPeople talk about the scandals, the darkness at the heart.  They say maybe things would be different if there were women priests, if the men could walk with wives by their side. But what good are rules against the devil in a man’s heart? There are married men who do bad things. It ain't tied to the collar or the vow of celibacy. It's something deeper, something dark and twisted. \n\nThey say you can’t hide something like that, that it’ll come out. Maybe. Or maybe it’ll fester, hidden away like a wound that never heals. Maybe the church, like the world, is just a place where darkness dwells, waiting for its chance.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of a broken world. He'd seen it all before, the lies, the blood, the ash settling like a shroud. September's grief, a raw wound still bleeding.  They'd been told of a monster, a phantom threat, a devil in the desert. A puppet master pulling strings, a hand reaching for the heavens.  But the monster, it turned out, wasn't a man. It was the lie itself, a serpent coiled in the heart of power, its venom seeping into the bones of the nation.\n\nHe remembered the words, the man in the uniform, his voice a rasping echo in the suffocating air. Weapons of mass destruction.  A threat to freedom. A just cause. Lies spun from the same thread as the smoke rising from the ruins of a city devoured by fire.\n\nPowell, the general, his face etched with the weariness of a man who'd seen too much, too late. He'd stood before the world, a salesman peddling a poisoned truth. Now, even he admitted the charade, the faintest whisper of regret in his voice.\n\nMalfeasance. Impeachment. Empty words against the tide of blood. A disregard for the Constitution, a casual dismantling of the very foundations of their world. The twilight of democracy, a slow, agonizing descent into darkness.\n\nHe thought of the young men, sent to fight a phantom, their dreams swallowed by the desert sand.  Their mothers, their fathers, their sisters, their wives, left to pick up the pieces of shattered lives.  \n\nThe war, a festering wound, oozing its poison into the world. A brutal, senseless conflict, fueled by greed and fear. The echo of gunfire, the distant screams, a symphony of destruction.\n\nAnd now, a fragile peace, a patchwork of alliances stitched together with threads of hope and despair. A government teetering on the brink, a nation fractured and bleeding. The old man shook his head, a silent lament for a world gone astray.",
            "The air was thick with dust, the silence broken only by the rasp of wind across the cracked earth. He spoke in a low voice, a monotone born of weary acceptance. \"It don't feel right, this whole affair. Like a fever dream, chasing shadows.\"  \n\nHe paused, his gaze distant, lost in the ash-choked horizon. \"They say it's about justice, about payback for what happened. But it's more like a hunger, a need to prove something, to stick it to them.\"\n\nHis words were tight, measured, like stones dropped into a well. \"They say it's about democracy, about bringing light to a dark place. But the light ain't taking hold, just burnin' away what little's left.\" \n\nHe ran a hand through his hair, the gesture tired, defeated. \"It's like we're tryin' to build a church on a foundation of dust. The wind just blows it all away.\"\n\nA bitterness laced his voice. \"They say it's about oil, about security. But the oil's black gold, and the security's a fleeting thing. The only thing real are the dead, the ones who don't come home.\"\n\nHe looked at the sun, a pale disc in the gray sky, and spat. \"I don't know what the answer is, what the point is anymore. It just feels like a slow, grinding death, for everyone involved.\"\n\nHe fell silent, the words hanging heavy in the dust-filled air.",
            "The road stretched on, gray and broken, coated in the ash of some long-gone fire.  He knew the boy wouldn't understand the words, wouldn't grasp the weight of them, but he'd say them anyway. \"Separation of church and state,\" he'd murmur, the words tasting like dust in his mouth. \"Writ large in the book, right there in black and white.\"\n\nThe boy, he was young, eyes still bright with the light of innocence.  He wouldn't see the darkness that clung to these things, the shadows that stretched long and silent over the land.  How could he? He saw only the world as it was, the sun beating down on the cracked earth, the wind whispering through the skeletal remains of trees.\n\nBut the man, he saw the ghosts. He saw the hands reaching from the ground, clawing at the sky. He saw the faces in the ash, etched with the pain of a world gone mad. He saw the hunger in the eyes of men, the endless hunger for power, for control.\n\nAnd he knew, deep in the bone, that this push for a new law, this attempt to bind the church and the state together, it was a seed of that hunger. It was a step closer to the abyss.\n\n\"They want to take away our freedom,\" he'd tell the boy, his voice rough with the grit of the road. \"They want to tell us what to think, what to believe. But the book, the book says different. It says we have a right to our own faith.\"\n\nHe knew the boy wouldn't understand all the words, but he'd feel the weight of them. He'd feel the fear, the desperation that gnawed at the man's soul.  And in that shared fear, in that silent communion, they would find a kind of solace. A fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, the darkness wouldn't win.",
            "The dust settled on the cracked asphalt. A silence hung over the ruins of what had once been a city, thick as the ash that choked the air. It was the kind of silence that pressed in on a man, a silence that spoke of things long gone and things never to be. He didn't know if he'd ever seen the sun in its full light again, not since the world had turned to ash.\n\nHe kept the pistol close. Always close. The boy walked beside him, his face pale beneath the grime, his eyes wide and watchful. They were moving south, toward a country that promised nothing but more dust and more silence. He didn't know if there was anything left worth finding, but he kept walking, driven by a whisper, a promise of something beyond the endless gray.\n\n\"What happened here?\" the boy asked, his voice small and thin against the wind.\n\n\"The world forgets,\" he said, his voice a rough rasp. \"It's hard to remember what it was like before.\" He looked at the boy, his eyes shadowed. \"Before the fire.\"\n\nThey moved through the skeletal remains of buildings, past twisted metal and shattered glass. The air was thick with the smell of decay and the bitter tang of dust. He stopped at a boarded-up storefront, its windows cracked and vacant.\n\n\"What was this place?\"\n\n\"A store,\" he said, his gaze drifting to a faded sign that hung precariously from the wall. \"They sold things people wanted.\"\n\nThe boy frowned. \"What kind of things?\"\n\nHe couldn't answer. He didn't remember. He could only feel the weight of the silence, the emptiness that stretched before them like a vast, unending desert.\n\nThey continued on, their footsteps echoing in the stillness. The boy walked on, his small hand clutching his father's. He didn't question anymore. He had learned to hold onto the hand that held him, to trust the silence that surrounded them.",
            "The air hung thick with it, this business of love. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, he’d seen them all.  He’d seen them in the shadows, eyes locked like hunted things. He’d seen them in the light, hands intertwined, a quiet defiance in their gaze.  Love, he thought, a word worn thin by the world.  A word that carried the weight of judgment, of fear.  But in the end, it was just a thing, a pull, a fire that burned in the belly. \n\nHe’d seen it in the faces of children, too, a innocence he couldn’t remember. A boy with his arm around another boy, a girl with her head on a girl’s shoulder.  The same look he’d seen in his own father’s eyes, years ago, on a day the world had felt different, maybe even hopeful.\n\nHe knew the world tried to cage it, this love, to teach it a place in the shadows. To say it was wrong, unnatural.  But the man knew better. He’d seen the world unravel, seen the darkness creep in.  He’d seen the laws laid down, the lines drawn. But love, that fire, it wouldn’t be tamed. It burned on, a defiant spark in the growing gloom.\n\nHe’d seen it in the eyes of those who clung to the old ways, the fear, the anger.  A fear of what they didn't understand, a hatred born of ignorance.  But the man saw the truth: love was the only thing strong enough to fight the darkness.  It was the only thing worth fighting for.",
            "The words hang in the air, frail and echoing. A public forum, he says.  The net, a sprawling web, casting its shadow over every act, every thought.  You put it out there, and it sticks. A stain on the soul of the world.  He speaks of shootings, of violence, the kind that stains the air thick and heavy.  Someone will hear, someone will see.  The school, forced to act, to protect, to police the dreams of the young.  A whisper, a rumour, a joke skewed in the harsh light of day.  An experiment gone wrong, a sociology lesson turned chilling.  He remembers, remembers the boy, the boy's laughter in the face of a storm. On Facebook, on Myspace, words bleed into the void.  There is no privacy, no sanctuary.  The past, the future, all flattened by the cold eye of the screen.  The school, a fortress under siege, forced to sift through the digital detritus, searching for the spark, the flicker of danger.  He speaks of invasion, of boundaries breached, of the teacher’s gaze, predatory and unwelcome, lurking in the shadows of the internet.  But the words fall flat, hollow.  For in the digital world, there is no sanctuary, no hidden corner where secrets can lie undisturbed.   The internet, a judge, jury, and executioner, passes its sentence on everyone.",
            "The war, it stretches on. A wound that festers. The purpose, once clear, now a dim memory. A ghost of something good, something righteous. But the years have bled it dry. Left us chasing shadows. Proving something, to whom? To ourselves? A hollow victory, a pyrrhic cost.\n\nHe remembers the talk at the start. Democracy, a righteous cause. A hand outstretched to lift a people from tyranny. But somewhere along the line, the whispers turned to shouts. The motives, once veiled in patriotism, now nakedly exposed. The past, a tangled skein of oil fields and family feuds, cast a long, dark shadow over the present.\n\nThis land, this ravaged land, it bears the weight of it all.  The ghosts of fallen soldiers, the hollow eyes of refugees. The stench of dust and death hangs heavy in the air.\n\nIs this what they fought for? This endless, grinding conflict? Once, there was a purpose. Now, there's only the echo of it, a fading drumbeat in the desert wind.\n\nHe sees the faces of the dead, the broken bodies, the shattered dreams. He feels the weight of the world on his shoulders, the burden of a war that never ends.\n\nHe thinks of his own children, their laughter a distant memory. Their futures stolen by a conflict that has consumed everything. He wonders if they will ever know peace.\n\nHe wonders if he will.",
            "The question hung in the air, a moth caught in the dust motes of the room. \n\n\"Uh,\" she began, voice thin as a whisper. \"It was stopped, see, 'cause someone found it online.\"\n\nHe leaned back, the worn wood of the chair groaning beneath him. \"Mmm.\"\n\n\"Online? But Myspace...\" she hesitated, the words catching on her tongue. \"It's, well, it's supposed to be private, isn't it? You have to be friends.\"\n\n\"Friends,\" he echoed, the sound a hollow drumbeat in the silence. \"But isn't that what gives them permission? To see?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" she mumbled, picking at a loose thread on her sleeve. \"It's like, if you put it out there...\"\n\n\"You give it over,\" he finished, his voice a low rumble.\n\nA silence fell, thick and heavy as the dust that coated everything.\n\n\"But what if it was good,\" she finally said, her voice barely audible. \"What if someone saw it, and it meant saving a life?\"\n\n\"Tough,\" he said, the word a stone dropped in the stillness. \"You can't have some soul policing every profile, watching for trouble.\"\n\n\"But...\" she started, then stopped, her face pale and drawn. \"It's like, what if they were just looking, accidentally?\"\n\n\"Accidentally,\" he repeated, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. \"Or looking for something, a sign... \"\n\nHe trailed off, his eyes distant, seeing something beyond the chipped paint on the walls, something dark and terrible.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he said finally, his voice a rasp, \"what you put out there... it finds its way back.\"",
            "The boy sat with a crumpled pack of cigarettes in his hand, staring at the dust motes dancing in the light filtering through the cracked windowpane. \"It's all gone to shit, ain't it?\" he rasped, the words rattling in his chest like loose gravel.\n\n\"You think?\" The man, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by sun and worry, didn't look up from the worn photograph he clutched in his calloused hand. A faded image of a woman with eyes the color of a storm-tossed sea and a smile that promised a warmth long gone.\n\n\"Yeah. I mean, what was it all for?\" The boy stubbed out the cigarette on the floor, the glowing ember a fleeting defiance in the gloom. \"They said it'd be different. Said we'd bring freedom, democracy, all that shit. But it's just... ash.\"\n\nThe man nodded, the photograph clutched tight. \"They always say that. But the only thing they bring is dust and bone.\"\n\nSilence settled in the room, heavy and thick like the smoke that hung in the air. Outside, the wind howled like a wounded animal, whipping the dust into frenzied dances. \n\n\"I hate it,\" the boy whispered, his voice barely audible above the wind. \"I hate this place, this world. I hate that I might die here, with nothing but ash for company.\"\n\nThe man placed the photograph down on a dusty table, his eyes distant, lost in a memory that burned brighter than the dying embers of the world. \"There's always somewhere else,\" he said, his voice a brittle whisper. \"Somewhere beyond the dust, beyond the ash. There's always hope.\"\n\nThe boy looked at him, his eyes filled with a weariness that belied his years. \"Hope?\" he scoffed. \"Hope's a luxury we can't afford.\" \n\nThe man reached out, his hand rough and calloused, and placed it on the boy's shoulder. \"No,\" he said, his voice firm despite the tremors that shook his body. \"Hope is the only thing we have left.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of it all.  The wind, it rasped and sighed through the skeletal trees, carrying the grit of broken things.  Yeah, he felt it. The discrimination.  Cut deep, like a bone-knife. Not just for the women, though they bore the brunt.  A sickness in the marrow, the way the world saw things.\n\nHe thought of the women, trapped behind the glass roof, invisible to the men above.  Qualified, but never chosen.  Their dreams choked by the dust of history.  And the men, hemmed in too, by expectations like iron bars.  The stay-at-home dads, their hands calloused not from labor but from yearning,  looked upon with suspicion, their souls branded as lesser.\n\nThen there was the fashion, a world of brittle beauty where men who dared to dream in silks and satins were met with scorn.  \"Don't tell me about fashion, son,\" they'd sneer, \"you don't know the first thing about a woman's heart.\"  They were blind, these men, to the subtle whispers of style, the language of cloth and thread.\n\nIt was a slow burn, this injustice.  A fire smoldering under the ashes of a world that refused to see.  Change, it was a hard thing to come by.  But maybe, just maybe, a seed of understanding could take root in the barren soil.  Maybe a whisper of empathy could pierce the thick fog of prejudice.  Maybe, someday, the world would see the men and women beyond the labels, beyond the expectations, and recognize the truth:  that every soul, regardless of gender, yearned for the same things - love, acceptance, and the freedom to be themselves.",
            "The air hung thick with the smoke of things unsaid, of arguments half-remembered. Legalized, they called it. Decriminalized.  A word like cheap tobacco, meant to soothe the rough edges. He knew what it meant though. A ticket, maybe a fine. A blot on the record, a shadow that clung to you like dust. But the boy wouldn't understand. He was young, still wet behind the ears, trusting in the world's promises.\n\nHe thought about the cost, the hollow echoes of it all. The money spent to lock men up, to drag them through the system, to feed them to the maw of the state. And for what? A joint? A puff of smoke? It was a fool's errand, a waste of breath.\n\nDenver, they said. A place with open hearts and open minds. Where the air itself reeked of change, of a willingness to turn the page. But even there,  the taste of it was bitter. Like a promise whispered in the dark, doubted from the start.\n\nHe thought of the lake, the stillness of it, the way the sun bled into the water.  His uncle, weathered and silent, pulling a tree stump from the depths. A day spent in the quiet, the only sound the scrape of oars against wood. A memory, fading like the smell of woodsmoke on the wind.\n\nMarijuana. It wasn't just about the weed itself. It was about control.  About power. About the lines drawn in the sand, the boundaries that separated the haves from the have-nots.\n\nHe looked at the boy, who was still young enough to believe in fairytales. A flicker of something in his eyes, a question he didn't dare voice. He knew those questions would come. The boy would learn, in time, the harsh truths of the world. But for now, he would hold onto the illusions, the fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, things could be better.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  A shadow fell across the cracked pavement. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice a rasp. \"Because tradition binds, it holds a man to the earth. Like some ancient root. But the wind changes, and the river bends. To be rooted is to be still, to be vulnerable.\" He paused, his gaze fixed on a distant point beyond the skeletal remains of buildings. \"The weight of it, though. The expectation. It can smother a man. A man has to breathe.\"\n\nHe remembered the cold stone of the church pews, the scent of incense, the weight of the priest's gaze. \"They speak of love, of acceptance. But the church itself is a cage. Small and narrow, with bars of scripture and dogma. They judge those who fall outside the lines, who dare to question.\"  His hand clenched, knuckles white. \"My father, he was different. He sought light in the wrong places. They wouldn't bridge the gap, wouldn't accept his kind. No love there, just judgment.\"\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his eyes reflecting the dust-choked sky. \"They say you must be perfect, but perfection is a lie. A brittle thing, easily shattered. And what of those who stumble? Those who yearn for something more? They are cast out, left to wander in the wilderness of their own doubts.\"\n\nThe boy shifted, his silence a heavy weight. \"They say love is the answer,\" the man continued, his voice a low murmur. \"But love cannot exist without acceptance. Without understanding.  Without the courage to look beyond the surface, beyond the rigid rules, and see the human heart.\"",
            "The line blurred. Where did one stop and the other begin? Church and state. Right and wrong.  Two souls bound, two souls adrift.  It was a knot that twisted tighter with every word spoken, every heart felt. This wasn't some tidy debate. This was the marrow of the matter.  \n\nWas it a sacrament or a contract?  A whispered prayer in a dim church or a line scratched on a government form?  Didn't matter. Didn't it come down to two souls seeking shelter, a haven in the storm? \n\nShould the hand of the state reach into the sanctity of vows?  Or was it a matter of flesh and blood, a union recognized by the very act of joining? \n\nBaptism didn't bring tax breaks, not a single one. It didn't grant a special place at the table.  So why then, was marriage different?  Why this insistence on defining love by the weight of a law?\n\nTwo souls. Two hearts.  A shared breath. Wasn't that enough?  Didn't the government have its own burdens to bear, its own line in the sand to draw?\n\nCivil unions.  That felt closer, more honest.  No pretense, no grand pronouncements. Just two souls saying, \"Here we are.  Here we stand.\"\n\nAnd what of the states?  They clamored for their own truths, their own versions of right and wrong.  But if they could find common ground, wouldn't that be a victory?  \n\nA federal law, a beacon of shared understanding.  But an amendment?  Oh, no.  The Constitution. Sacred. Untouchable.  To sacrifice its sanctity for this?  To enshrine division in its hallowed halls?\n\nIt wasn't right. It wasn't just. It was a wound dug deep into the fabric of the nation.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of old beliefs, the scent of sulfur and regret.  Homosexuality, it was a thing whispered in the shadows, a question mark etched on the face of the land.  Raised under a roof of hymns and scripture, the notion was a tangled knot in his gut, a discord in the melody of his upbringing. He had friends, yes, souls bound by laughter and shared secrets, their laughter echoing in the hollows of his memories. Friends who walked a path he couldn't quite comprehend, a path paved with whispers and stolen glances.\n\nHe didn't understand it, not truly. But he saw the pain in their eyes, the ache for acceptance, the yearning for a love that mirrored his own. And in that, he saw a reflection of the human need, a longing for connection that transcended the boundaries of the flesh.  \n\nThe law, he felt, should be a shield, not a sword. To impose his vision, his rigid notions, on others, that felt wrong.  States, these microcosms of America, should be the arbiters of their own fate, allowed to shape their own destinies.  After all, wasn't it the right of each soul to choose its own path, to seek its own truth, even if it lay beyond the boundaries of his understanding?\n\nHe thought of the old man, his uncle, weathered and set in his ways, his pipe perpetually clenched between his teeth. A man who believed in the sanctity of tradition, in the unyielding grip of the past. But even the old man, with his stoic silence and unblinking eyes, had a flicker of humanity in his gaze, a recognition of the inherent worth of every human being.\n\nHe wished he could offer more, a clearer answer, a solution that would mend the fractured heart of the nation. But all he had were these fragments of thought, these whispered echoes in the vast emptiness of uncertainty.  \n\nFor the answers, he knew, lay not in the pronouncements of men, but in the quiet spaces between the lines, in the shared humanity that bound them all together, despite their differences.",
            "The boy shuffled closer, his breath a thin mist in the cold.  \"They're watching us,\" he said, eyes narrowed.  His voice was a rasp, like dry leaves skittering on pavement.\n\n\"They're always watching,\" the man said, his gaze fixed on the bleached horizon. The world was a canvas of ash, the sky a pale, bruised thing.  \"But they can't see everything.\"\n\nThe boy's face, gaunt and pale, was etched with worry. \"What if they find us?\"\n\nThe man tightened his grip on the rusted pistol tucked into his belt. \"Then we'll walk on.\"\n\nThey had been moving south for weeks, their path a jagged scar across the barren landscape.  The boy didn't ask questions anymore. He just walked, his small hand clutching the man's, his gaze fixed on the road ahead.  They lived in the silence of the road, the whisper of the wind through the skeletal trees, the rasp of their own breaths.\n\nHe remembered a time before. A time of warmth and light, of laughter and the smell of rain on dry earth.  But that time was gone, swallowed by the ash and the silence. Now, the world was a wasteland, a testament to some forgotten apocalypse.\n\nThey had found the city by chance, a skeletal monument to a vanished world. Buildings rose like broken teeth against the gray sky, windows empty sockets staring out at the desolation.  There was nothing left inside, only dust and the ghosts of memories.\n\nHe had stopped the boy from going inside. \"Remember what I told you,\" he had said, his voice a low growl. \"Don't touch anything. Don't look too closely.\"\n\nThe boy had nodded, eyes wide and wary.\n\nThey had found shelter in a ruined church, its stained-glass windows shattered, its walls scarred with graffiti.  The air was thick with the smell of decay, but it was a dry, brittle decay, like the husk of something long dead.\n\nThe boy slept restlessly, his nightmares echoing in the silence. The man sat beside him, hand resting on the boy's shoulder, a silent promise.  He would protect him.  He would keep him safe.\n\nHe would keep the darkness at bay.",
            "The dust of it all. War. The way it clung to him, a memory the color of ash. At first, the fires of September had burned bright in his gut, a need for retribution. To strike back against that darkness, to repay in kind. Like a fevered dream, the thought of it had seemed clear, righteous. To go over and make them pay. \n\nBut now, the embers had cooled. The heat had turned to a hollow ache. He saw the flaws in the plan, the cracks in the foundation. They’d gone in blind, driven by rage, unprepared for the tangled roots of the place. A tangled mess of history and hate, a land where men fought not for ideals but for scraps, for survival.\n\nHe thought about the faces, the eyes that stared back from the dust-choked streets. How could they understand? How could they be understood? They were caught in a cycle, a endless loop of violence. Us against them, them against us. He couldn’t reach them, couldn’t offer them anything but more of the same.\n\nIt wasn't their fault, he realized. Not entirely. But it wasn't his fault either. He'd been a pawn, a cog in a machine that had ground them all down. And now, the machine kept turning, fueled by anger and fear. \n\nHe looked out at the horizon, a vast emptiness under the sun-bleached sky. What was the point? What had they achieved? He didn't know. He only knew that the war had taken something from him, something he couldn't get back. He saw a flicker of ash in the wind, a ghost of the fires that had consumed so much.\n\nHe turned away, the weight of it all pressing down on his chest.  It was time to walk away. Leave the dust and the ashes behind. \n\nHe had to. For himself."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, it needs changing. Its ways, they're as old as dust. They say the flock is thinning, and maybe that's because the shepherd ain't looking in the right direction.  You can't hold onto things like they're buried in stone. Things like marriage, like a woman's place, like the blood of the unborn - they ain't set in concrete. Times change. \n\nTake marriage, for instance. Loving two of the same kind, it don't feel wrong to me. Feels like God made us all with a need to love, to share our lives. And that ain't no sin.  Then there's the matter of birth control, of a woman's right over her own body.  The Church says it's against God's will, but who made them the judge? God gave them free will, didn't he?\n\nFolks are leaving, you see. They can't swallow the old ways anymore. They want something more, something that speaks to the world they live in. The Church needs to open its eyes, see the world for what it is, not what it was.",
            "The boy’s words hung thin in the air, sharp as broken glass. A question. A truth laid bare. He didn't know what to say.  What could he say?  That love was a river, flowing sometimes in strange and unexpected channels? That the heart, a dark lodge in the chest, beat to its own drum?  He'd seen the boy’s eyes, clear and blue as a winter sky,  searching his face for an answer.  There was no easy answer.  Just the silence, heavy and thick as ash.\n\nHe'd seen men, his own father among them, wrestled with this thing, this truth. Their words, tangled like roots in the dirt, choked on the unspoken.  There was a fear in their eyes, a fear of the unknown, a fear of what they couldn't understand.\n\nBut the boy, he was young, innocent. He didn't see the darkness, the fear, the hate that coiled in the world's gut. He just saw the truth. Pure and simple.\n\nHe looked at the boy, his small hand clutching his own. The lightness of his touch, the innocence in his face, it cut through the lies, the whispers, the fear.  It was a truth he couldn't deny.\n\nHe squeezed the boy's hand.  \"It's right,\" he said, his voice rough, \"It's right to love.\"",
            "The road stretched out ahead, a black ribbon frayed at the edges by the dust. The boy walked beside him, legs thin and pale in the sun. They were headed south, chasing the ghost of warmth. \n\n\"Will it get warmer?\" The boy's voice was small, lost in the wind that scoured the plains.\n\nThe man didn't answer. He squinted at the horizon, searching for something, anything, that might hold the promise of respite. \n\nHe thought of the man in the white suit, the one who'd said, \"Marriage is a sacred covenant between a man and a woman.\" Words meant to bind, meant to exclude. But what of the covenants forged in the crucible of shared hardship, the bond forged in the ashes of a world gone cold?\n\nHe thought of the woman in the church pew, her eyes brimming with righteous anger. \"It's unnatural,\" she'd hissed, \"an abomination against God.\" But what of the love that bloomed in the heart of a storm, the tenderness that found solace in shared fear?\n\nHe thought of the boy, his hand tucked tight in his own. He saw the question in the boy's eyes, a reflection of the question that gnawed at him too. Was their love, their bond, less valid because it didn't fit the mold? Was it less worthy of protection, of the simple dignity that came with a legal name, a shared future?\n\n\"We'll be warm,\" he finally said, his voice rough with the dust of the road. It was a promise whispered on the wind, a prayer for a dawn that might bring not just warmth, but understanding.",
            "The boy spoke. Said it was wrong. To keep something locked away just ‘cause it was forbidden. Like some kind of sin.  \n\nHe’d seen it in the pharmacy. The vials. The bottles. Rows and rows of things that could cure and solace and hurt. Things the law said were good and things it said were bad. But the line was thin.  \n\n“Just because they say ‘no’ doesn’t mean it ain’t right,” the boy said.\n\nHe thought about it. The boy was young, eyes still bright with a kind of innocence. But he knew the weight of a bottle. The power held in a single pill.\n\n“There are things that help,” he said. “Doctors use ‘em. But some are dangerous. Some are meant for people in need, not for just anyone.”\n\nThe boy frowned. “But what if the need ain’t for a doctor?”\n\nHe stopped. Didn’t know how to answer that. \n\nHe knew the boy was talking about the herb. The green smoke that curled in the night, the smell that lingered in the air. He’d seen the way it calmed the old man, the way it eased the pain in his mother’s bones. \n\nHe’d seen the way it made people forget.\n\n“It’s a slippery slope,” he said finally. “One step here, another there. Before you know it, you’re drowning in darkness.”\n\nThe boy shook his head. “Maybe the darkness is what they’re afraid of.”",
            "The church, it’s changed. Not the way you might think, not with some grand upheaval or revolution. More like the slow, patient rot of an old thing, crumbling from the inside out. When I was a girl, Sundays meant lace and silk, little shoes that pinched and purses that clutched a rosary. We’d all be there, God’s finest, in the pews, faces solemn, voices hushed. Now?  Jeans and khakis. Flip-flops in the summer. Families rushing in, hair tangled, kids whining. They call it \"teen mass,\" a quick thirty minutes to get it over with. \n\nPeople talk about the scandals, the darkness at the heart.  They say maybe things would be different if there were women priests, if the men could walk with wives by their side. But what good are rules against the devil in a man’s heart? There are married men who do bad things. It ain't tied to the collar or the vow of celibacy. It's something deeper, something dark and twisted. \n\nThey say you can’t hide something like that, that it’ll come out. Maybe. Or maybe it’ll fester, hidden away like a wound that never heals. Maybe the church, like the world, is just a place where darkness dwells, waiting for its chance.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of a broken world. He'd seen it all before, the lies, the blood, the ash settling like a shroud. September's grief, a raw wound still bleeding.  They'd been told of a monster, a phantom threat, a devil in the desert. A puppet master pulling strings, a hand reaching for the heavens.  But the monster, it turned out, wasn't a man. It was the lie itself, a serpent coiled in the heart of power, its venom seeping into the bones of the nation.\n\nHe remembered the words, the man in the uniform, his voice a rasping echo in the suffocating air. Weapons of mass destruction.  A threat to freedom. A just cause. Lies spun from the same thread as the smoke rising from the ruins of a city devoured by fire.\n\nPowell, the general, his face etched with the weariness of a man who'd seen too much, too late. He'd stood before the world, a salesman peddling a poisoned truth. Now, even he admitted the charade, the faintest whisper of regret in his voice.\n\nMalfeasance. Impeachment. Empty words against the tide of blood. A disregard for the Constitution, a casual dismantling of the very foundations of their world. The twilight of democracy, a slow, agonizing descent into darkness.\n\nHe thought of the young men, sent to fight a phantom, their dreams swallowed by the desert sand.  Their mothers, their fathers, their sisters, their wives, left to pick up the pieces of shattered lives.  \n\nThe war, a festering wound, oozing its poison into the world. A brutal, senseless conflict, fueled by greed and fear. The echo of gunfire, the distant screams, a symphony of destruction.\n\nAnd now, a fragile peace, a patchwork of alliances stitched together with threads of hope and despair. A government teetering on the brink, a nation fractured and bleeding. The old man shook his head, a silent lament for a world gone astray.",
            "The air was thick with dust, the silence broken only by the rasp of wind across the cracked earth. He spoke in a low voice, a monotone born of weary acceptance. \"It don't feel right, this whole affair. Like a fever dream, chasing shadows.\"  \n\nHe paused, his gaze distant, lost in the ash-choked horizon. \"They say it's about justice, about payback for what happened. But it's more like a hunger, a need to prove something, to stick it to them.\"\n\nHis words were tight, measured, like stones dropped into a well. \"They say it's about democracy, about bringing light to a dark place. But the light ain't taking hold, just burnin' away what little's left.\" \n\nHe ran a hand through his hair, the gesture tired, defeated. \"It's like we're tryin' to build a church on a foundation of dust. The wind just blows it all away.\"\n\nA bitterness laced his voice. \"They say it's about oil, about security. But the oil's black gold, and the security's a fleeting thing. The only thing real are the dead, the ones who don't come home.\"\n\nHe looked at the sun, a pale disc in the gray sky, and spat. \"I don't know what the answer is, what the point is anymore. It just feels like a slow, grinding death, for everyone involved.\"\n\nHe fell silent, the words hanging heavy in the dust-filled air.",
            "The road stretched on, gray and broken, coated in the ash of some long-gone fire.  He knew the boy wouldn't understand the words, wouldn't grasp the weight of them, but he'd say them anyway. \"Separation of church and state,\" he'd murmur, the words tasting like dust in his mouth. \"Writ large in the book, right there in black and white.\"\n\nThe boy, he was young, eyes still bright with the light of innocence.  He wouldn't see the darkness that clung to these things, the shadows that stretched long and silent over the land.  How could he? He saw only the world as it was, the sun beating down on the cracked earth, the wind whispering through the skeletal remains of trees.\n\nBut the man, he saw the ghosts. He saw the hands reaching from the ground, clawing at the sky. He saw the faces in the ash, etched with the pain of a world gone mad. He saw the hunger in the eyes of men, the endless hunger for power, for control.\n\nAnd he knew, deep in the bone, that this push for a new law, this attempt to bind the church and the state together, it was a seed of that hunger. It was a step closer to the abyss.\n\n\"They want to take away our freedom,\" he'd tell the boy, his voice rough with the grit of the road. \"They want to tell us what to think, what to believe. But the book, the book says different. It says we have a right to our own faith.\"\n\nHe knew the boy wouldn't understand all the words, but he'd feel the weight of them. He'd feel the fear, the desperation that gnawed at the man's soul.  And in that shared fear, in that silent communion, they would find a kind of solace. A fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, the darkness wouldn't win.",
            "The dust settled on the cracked asphalt. A silence hung over the ruins of what had once been a city, thick as the ash that choked the air. It was the kind of silence that pressed in on a man, a silence that spoke of things long gone and things never to be. He didn't know if he'd ever seen the sun in its full light again, not since the world had turned to ash.\n\nHe kept the pistol close. Always close. The boy walked beside him, his face pale beneath the grime, his eyes wide and watchful. They were moving south, toward a country that promised nothing but more dust and more silence. He didn't know if there was anything left worth finding, but he kept walking, driven by a whisper, a promise of something beyond the endless gray.\n\n\"What happened here?\" the boy asked, his voice small and thin against the wind.\n\n\"The world forgets,\" he said, his voice a rough rasp. \"It's hard to remember what it was like before.\" He looked at the boy, his eyes shadowed. \"Before the fire.\"\n\nThey moved through the skeletal remains of buildings, past twisted metal and shattered glass. The air was thick with the smell of decay and the bitter tang of dust. He stopped at a boarded-up storefront, its windows cracked and vacant.\n\n\"What was this place?\"\n\n\"A store,\" he said, his gaze drifting to a faded sign that hung precariously from the wall. \"They sold things people wanted.\"\n\nThe boy frowned. \"What kind of things?\"\n\nHe couldn't answer. He didn't remember. He could only feel the weight of the silence, the emptiness that stretched before them like a vast, unending desert.\n\nThey continued on, their footsteps echoing in the stillness. The boy walked on, his small hand clutching his father's. He didn't question anymore. He had learned to hold onto the hand that held him, to trust the silence that surrounded them.",
            "The air hung thick with it, this business of love. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, he’d seen them all.  He’d seen them in the shadows, eyes locked like hunted things. He’d seen them in the light, hands intertwined, a quiet defiance in their gaze.  Love, he thought, a word worn thin by the world.  A word that carried the weight of judgment, of fear.  But in the end, it was just a thing, a pull, a fire that burned in the belly. \n\nHe’d seen it in the faces of children, too, a innocence he couldn’t remember. A boy with his arm around another boy, a girl with her head on a girl’s shoulder.  The same look he’d seen in his own father’s eyes, years ago, on a day the world had felt different, maybe even hopeful.\n\nHe knew the world tried to cage it, this love, to teach it a place in the shadows. To say it was wrong, unnatural.  But the man knew better. He’d seen the world unravel, seen the darkness creep in.  He’d seen the laws laid down, the lines drawn. But love, that fire, it wouldn’t be tamed. It burned on, a defiant spark in the growing gloom.\n\nHe’d seen it in the eyes of those who clung to the old ways, the fear, the anger.  A fear of what they didn't understand, a hatred born of ignorance.  But the man saw the truth: love was the only thing strong enough to fight the darkness.  It was the only thing worth fighting for.",
            "The words hang in the air, frail and echoing. A public forum, he says.  The net, a sprawling web, casting its shadow over every act, every thought.  You put it out there, and it sticks. A stain on the soul of the world.  He speaks of shootings, of violence, the kind that stains the air thick and heavy.  Someone will hear, someone will see.  The school, forced to act, to protect, to police the dreams of the young.  A whisper, a rumour, a joke skewed in the harsh light of day.  An experiment gone wrong, a sociology lesson turned chilling.  He remembers, remembers the boy, the boy's laughter in the face of a storm. On Facebook, on Myspace, words bleed into the void.  There is no privacy, no sanctuary.  The past, the future, all flattened by the cold eye of the screen.  The school, a fortress under siege, forced to sift through the digital detritus, searching for the spark, the flicker of danger.  He speaks of invasion, of boundaries breached, of the teacher’s gaze, predatory and unwelcome, lurking in the shadows of the internet.  But the words fall flat, hollow.  For in the digital world, there is no sanctuary, no hidden corner where secrets can lie undisturbed.   The internet, a judge, jury, and executioner, passes its sentence on everyone.",
            "The war, it stretches on. A wound that festers. The purpose, once clear, now a dim memory. A ghost of something good, something righteous. But the years have bled it dry. Left us chasing shadows. Proving something, to whom? To ourselves? A hollow victory, a pyrrhic cost.\n\nHe remembers the talk at the start. Democracy, a righteous cause. A hand outstretched to lift a people from tyranny. But somewhere along the line, the whispers turned to shouts. The motives, once veiled in patriotism, now nakedly exposed. The past, a tangled skein of oil fields and family feuds, cast a long, dark shadow over the present.\n\nThis land, this ravaged land, it bears the weight of it all.  The ghosts of fallen soldiers, the hollow eyes of refugees. The stench of dust and death hangs heavy in the air.\n\nIs this what they fought for? This endless, grinding conflict? Once, there was a purpose. Now, there's only the echo of it, a fading drumbeat in the desert wind.\n\nHe sees the faces of the dead, the broken bodies, the shattered dreams. He feels the weight of the world on his shoulders, the burden of a war that never ends.\n\nHe thinks of his own children, their laughter a distant memory. Their futures stolen by a conflict that has consumed everything. He wonders if they will ever know peace.\n\nHe wonders if he will.",
            "The question hung in the air, a moth caught in the dust motes of the room. \n\n\"Uh,\" she began, voice thin as a whisper. \"It was stopped, see, 'cause someone found it online.\"\n\nHe leaned back, the worn wood of the chair groaning beneath him. \"Mmm.\"\n\n\"Online? But Myspace...\" she hesitated, the words catching on her tongue. \"It's, well, it's supposed to be private, isn't it? You have to be friends.\"\n\n\"Friends,\" he echoed, the sound a hollow drumbeat in the silence. \"But isn't that what gives them permission? To see?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" she mumbled, picking at a loose thread on her sleeve. \"It's like, if you put it out there...\"\n\n\"You give it over,\" he finished, his voice a low rumble.\n\nA silence fell, thick and heavy as the dust that coated everything.\n\n\"But what if it was good,\" she finally said, her voice barely audible. \"What if someone saw it, and it meant saving a life?\"\n\n\"Tough,\" he said, the word a stone dropped in the stillness. \"You can't have some soul policing every profile, watching for trouble.\"\n\n\"But...\" she started, then stopped, her face pale and drawn. \"It's like, what if they were just looking, accidentally?\"\n\n\"Accidentally,\" he repeated, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. \"Or looking for something, a sign... \"\n\nHe trailed off, his eyes distant, seeing something beyond the chipped paint on the walls, something dark and terrible.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he said finally, his voice a rasp, \"what you put out there... it finds its way back.\"",
            "The boy sat with a crumpled pack of cigarettes in his hand, staring at the dust motes dancing in the light filtering through the cracked windowpane. \"It's all gone to shit, ain't it?\" he rasped, the words rattling in his chest like loose gravel.\n\n\"You think?\" The man, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by sun and worry, didn't look up from the worn photograph he clutched in his calloused hand. A faded image of a woman with eyes the color of a storm-tossed sea and a smile that promised a warmth long gone.\n\n\"Yeah. I mean, what was it all for?\" The boy stubbed out the cigarette on the floor, the glowing ember a fleeting defiance in the gloom. \"They said it'd be different. Said we'd bring freedom, democracy, all that shit. But it's just... ash.\"\n\nThe man nodded, the photograph clutched tight. \"They always say that. But the only thing they bring is dust and bone.\"\n\nSilence settled in the room, heavy and thick like the smoke that hung in the air. Outside, the wind howled like a wounded animal, whipping the dust into frenzied dances. \n\n\"I hate it,\" the boy whispered, his voice barely audible above the wind. \"I hate this place, this world. I hate that I might die here, with nothing but ash for company.\"\n\nThe man placed the photograph down on a dusty table, his eyes distant, lost in a memory that burned brighter than the dying embers of the world. \"There's always somewhere else,\" he said, his voice a brittle whisper. \"Somewhere beyond the dust, beyond the ash. There's always hope.\"\n\nThe boy looked at him, his eyes filled with a weariness that belied his years. \"Hope?\" he scoffed. \"Hope's a luxury we can't afford.\" \n\nThe man reached out, his hand rough and calloused, and placed it on the boy's shoulder. \"No,\" he said, his voice firm despite the tremors that shook his body. \"Hope is the only thing we have left.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of it all.  The wind, it rasped and sighed through the skeletal trees, carrying the grit of broken things.  Yeah, he felt it. The discrimination.  Cut deep, like a bone-knife. Not just for the women, though they bore the brunt.  A sickness in the marrow, the way the world saw things.\n\nHe thought of the women, trapped behind the glass roof, invisible to the men above.  Qualified, but never chosen.  Their dreams choked by the dust of history.  And the men, hemmed in too, by expectations like iron bars.  The stay-at-home dads, their hands calloused not from labor but from yearning,  looked upon with suspicion, their souls branded as lesser.\n\nThen there was the fashion, a world of brittle beauty where men who dared to dream in silks and satins were met with scorn.  \"Don't tell me about fashion, son,\" they'd sneer, \"you don't know the first thing about a woman's heart.\"  They were blind, these men, to the subtle whispers of style, the language of cloth and thread.\n\nIt was a slow burn, this injustice.  A fire smoldering under the ashes of a world that refused to see.  Change, it was a hard thing to come by.  But maybe, just maybe, a seed of understanding could take root in the barren soil.  Maybe a whisper of empathy could pierce the thick fog of prejudice.  Maybe, someday, the world would see the men and women beyond the labels, beyond the expectations, and recognize the truth:  that every soul, regardless of gender, yearned for the same things - love, acceptance, and the freedom to be themselves.",
            "The air hung thick with the smoke of things unsaid, of arguments half-remembered. Legalized, they called it. Decriminalized.  A word like cheap tobacco, meant to soothe the rough edges. He knew what it meant though. A ticket, maybe a fine. A blot on the record, a shadow that clung to you like dust. But the boy wouldn't understand. He was young, still wet behind the ears, trusting in the world's promises.\n\nHe thought about the cost, the hollow echoes of it all. The money spent to lock men up, to drag them through the system, to feed them to the maw of the state. And for what? A joint? A puff of smoke? It was a fool's errand, a waste of breath.\n\nDenver, they said. A place with open hearts and open minds. Where the air itself reeked of change, of a willingness to turn the page. But even there,  the taste of it was bitter. Like a promise whispered in the dark, doubted from the start.\n\nHe thought of the lake, the stillness of it, the way the sun bled into the water.  His uncle, weathered and silent, pulling a tree stump from the depths. A day spent in the quiet, the only sound the scrape of oars against wood. A memory, fading like the smell of woodsmoke on the wind.\n\nMarijuana. It wasn't just about the weed itself. It was about control.  About power. About the lines drawn in the sand, the boundaries that separated the haves from the have-nots.\n\nHe looked at the boy, who was still young enough to believe in fairytales. A flicker of something in his eyes, a question he didn't dare voice. He knew those questions would come. The boy would learn, in time, the harsh truths of the world. But for now, he would hold onto the illusions, the fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, things could be better.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  A shadow fell across the cracked pavement. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice a rasp. \"Because tradition binds, it holds a man to the earth. Like some ancient root. But the wind changes, and the river bends. To be rooted is to be still, to be vulnerable.\" He paused, his gaze fixed on a distant point beyond the skeletal remains of buildings. \"The weight of it, though. The expectation. It can smother a man. A man has to breathe.\"\n\nHe remembered the cold stone of the church pews, the scent of incense, the weight of the priest's gaze. \"They speak of love, of acceptance. But the church itself is a cage. Small and narrow, with bars of scripture and dogma. They judge those who fall outside the lines, who dare to question.\"  His hand clenched, knuckles white. \"My father, he was different. He sought light in the wrong places. They wouldn't bridge the gap, wouldn't accept his kind. No love there, just judgment.\"\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his eyes reflecting the dust-choked sky. \"They say you must be perfect, but perfection is a lie. A brittle thing, easily shattered. And what of those who stumble? Those who yearn for something more? They are cast out, left to wander in the wilderness of their own doubts.\"\n\nThe boy shifted, his silence a heavy weight. \"They say love is the answer,\" the man continued, his voice a low murmur. \"But love cannot exist without acceptance. Without understanding.  Without the courage to look beyond the surface, beyond the rigid rules, and see the human heart.\"",
            "The line blurred. Where did one stop and the other begin? Church and state. Right and wrong.  Two souls bound, two souls adrift.  It was a knot that twisted tighter with every word spoken, every heart felt. This wasn't some tidy debate. This was the marrow of the matter.  \n\nWas it a sacrament or a contract?  A whispered prayer in a dim church or a line scratched on a government form?  Didn't matter. Didn't it come down to two souls seeking shelter, a haven in the storm? \n\nShould the hand of the state reach into the sanctity of vows?  Or was it a matter of flesh and blood, a union recognized by the very act of joining? \n\nBaptism didn't bring tax breaks, not a single one. It didn't grant a special place at the table.  So why then, was marriage different?  Why this insistence on defining love by the weight of a law?\n\nTwo souls. Two hearts.  A shared breath. Wasn't that enough?  Didn't the government have its own burdens to bear, its own line in the sand to draw?\n\nCivil unions.  That felt closer, more honest.  No pretense, no grand pronouncements. Just two souls saying, \"Here we are.  Here we stand.\"\n\nAnd what of the states?  They clamored for their own truths, their own versions of right and wrong.  But if they could find common ground, wouldn't that be a victory?  \n\nA federal law, a beacon of shared understanding.  But an amendment?  Oh, no.  The Constitution. Sacred. Untouchable.  To sacrifice its sanctity for this?  To enshrine division in its hallowed halls?\n\nIt wasn't right. It wasn't just. It was a wound dug deep into the fabric of the nation.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of old beliefs, the scent of sulfur and regret.  Homosexuality, it was a thing whispered in the shadows, a question mark etched on the face of the land.  Raised under a roof of hymns and scripture, the notion was a tangled knot in his gut, a discord in the melody of his upbringing. He had friends, yes, souls bound by laughter and shared secrets, their laughter echoing in the hollows of his memories. Friends who walked a path he couldn't quite comprehend, a path paved with whispers and stolen glances.\n\nHe didn't understand it, not truly. But he saw the pain in their eyes, the ache for acceptance, the yearning for a love that mirrored his own. And in that, he saw a reflection of the human need, a longing for connection that transcended the boundaries of the flesh.  \n\nThe law, he felt, should be a shield, not a sword. To impose his vision, his rigid notions, on others, that felt wrong.  States, these microcosms of America, should be the arbiters of their own fate, allowed to shape their own destinies.  After all, wasn't it the right of each soul to choose its own path, to seek its own truth, even if it lay beyond the boundaries of his understanding?\n\nHe thought of the old man, his uncle, weathered and set in his ways, his pipe perpetually clenched between his teeth. A man who believed in the sanctity of tradition, in the unyielding grip of the past. But even the old man, with his stoic silence and unblinking eyes, had a flicker of humanity in his gaze, a recognition of the inherent worth of every human being.\n\nHe wished he could offer more, a clearer answer, a solution that would mend the fractured heart of the nation. But all he had were these fragments of thought, these whispered echoes in the vast emptiness of uncertainty.  \n\nFor the answers, he knew, lay not in the pronouncements of men, but in the quiet spaces between the lines, in the shared humanity that bound them all together, despite their differences.",
            "The boy shuffled closer, his breath a thin mist in the cold.  \"They're watching us,\" he said, eyes narrowed.  His voice was a rasp, like dry leaves skittering on pavement.\n\n\"They're always watching,\" the man said, his gaze fixed on the bleached horizon. The world was a canvas of ash, the sky a pale, bruised thing.  \"But they can't see everything.\"\n\nThe boy's face, gaunt and pale, was etched with worry. \"What if they find us?\"\n\nThe man tightened his grip on the rusted pistol tucked into his belt. \"Then we'll walk on.\"\n\nThey had been moving south for weeks, their path a jagged scar across the barren landscape.  The boy didn't ask questions anymore. He just walked, his small hand clutching the man's, his gaze fixed on the road ahead.  They lived in the silence of the road, the whisper of the wind through the skeletal trees, the rasp of their own breaths.\n\nHe remembered a time before. A time of warmth and light, of laughter and the smell of rain on dry earth.  But that time was gone, swallowed by the ash and the silence. Now, the world was a wasteland, a testament to some forgotten apocalypse.\n\nThey had found the city by chance, a skeletal monument to a vanished world. Buildings rose like broken teeth against the gray sky, windows empty sockets staring out at the desolation.  There was nothing left inside, only dust and the ghosts of memories.\n\nHe had stopped the boy from going inside. \"Remember what I told you,\" he had said, his voice a low growl. \"Don't touch anything. Don't look too closely.\"\n\nThe boy had nodded, eyes wide and wary.\n\nThey had found shelter in a ruined church, its stained-glass windows shattered, its walls scarred with graffiti.  The air was thick with the smell of decay, but it was a dry, brittle decay, like the husk of something long dead.\n\nThe boy slept restlessly, his nightmares echoing in the silence. The man sat beside him, hand resting on the boy's shoulder, a silent promise.  He would protect him.  He would keep him safe.\n\nHe would keep the darkness at bay.",
            "The dust of it all. War. The way it clung to him, a memory the color of ash. At first, the fires of September had burned bright in his gut, a need for retribution. To strike back against that darkness, to repay in kind. Like a fevered dream, the thought of it had seemed clear, righteous. To go over and make them pay. \n\nBut now, the embers had cooled. The heat had turned to a hollow ache. He saw the flaws in the plan, the cracks in the foundation. They’d gone in blind, driven by rage, unprepared for the tangled roots of the place. A tangled mess of history and hate, a land where men fought not for ideals but for scraps, for survival.\n\nHe thought about the faces, the eyes that stared back from the dust-choked streets. How could they understand? How could they be understood? They were caught in a cycle, a endless loop of violence. Us against them, them against us. He couldn’t reach them, couldn’t offer them anything but more of the same.\n\nIt wasn't their fault, he realized. Not entirely. But it wasn't his fault either. He'd been a pawn, a cog in a machine that had ground them all down. And now, the machine kept turning, fueled by anger and fear. \n\nHe looked out at the horizon, a vast emptiness under the sun-bleached sky. What was the point? What had they achieved? He didn't know. He only knew that the war had taken something from him, something he couldn't get back. He saw a flicker of ash in the wind, a ghost of the fires that had consumed so much.\n\nHe turned away, the weight of it all pressing down on his chest.  It was time to walk away. Leave the dust and the ashes behind. \n\nHe had to. For himself."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Church, it needs changing. Its ways, they're as old as dust. They say the flock is thinning, and maybe that's because the shepherd ain't looking in the right direction.  You can't hold onto things like they're buried in stone. Things like marriage, like a woman's place, like the blood of the unborn - they ain't set in concrete. Times change. \n\nTake marriage, for instance. Loving two of the same kind, it don't feel wrong to me. Feels like God made us all with a need to love, to share our lives. And that ain't no sin.  Then there's the matter of birth control, of a woman's right over her own body.  The Church says it's against God's will, but who made them the judge? God gave them free will, didn't he?\n\nFolks are leaving, you see. They can't swallow the old ways anymore. They want something more, something that speaks to the world they live in. The Church needs to open its eyes, see the world for what it is, not what it was.",
            "The boy’s words hung thin in the air, sharp as broken glass. A question. A truth laid bare. He didn't know what to say.  What could he say?  That love was a river, flowing sometimes in strange and unexpected channels? That the heart, a dark lodge in the chest, beat to its own drum?  He'd seen the boy’s eyes, clear and blue as a winter sky,  searching his face for an answer.  There was no easy answer.  Just the silence, heavy and thick as ash.\n\nHe'd seen men, his own father among them, wrestled with this thing, this truth. Their words, tangled like roots in the dirt, choked on the unspoken.  There was a fear in their eyes, a fear of the unknown, a fear of what they couldn't understand.\n\nBut the boy, he was young, innocent. He didn't see the darkness, the fear, the hate that coiled in the world's gut. He just saw the truth. Pure and simple.\n\nHe looked at the boy, his small hand clutching his own. The lightness of his touch, the innocence in his face, it cut through the lies, the whispers, the fear.  It was a truth he couldn't deny.\n\nHe squeezed the boy's hand.  \"It's right,\" he said, his voice rough, \"It's right to love.\"",
            "The road stretched out ahead, a black ribbon frayed at the edges by the dust. The boy walked beside him, legs thin and pale in the sun. They were headed south, chasing the ghost of warmth. \n\n\"Will it get warmer?\" The boy's voice was small, lost in the wind that scoured the plains.\n\nThe man didn't answer. He squinted at the horizon, searching for something, anything, that might hold the promise of respite. \n\nHe thought of the man in the white suit, the one who'd said, \"Marriage is a sacred covenant between a man and a woman.\" Words meant to bind, meant to exclude. But what of the covenants forged in the crucible of shared hardship, the bond forged in the ashes of a world gone cold?\n\nHe thought of the woman in the church pew, her eyes brimming with righteous anger. \"It's unnatural,\" she'd hissed, \"an abomination against God.\" But what of the love that bloomed in the heart of a storm, the tenderness that found solace in shared fear?\n\nHe thought of the boy, his hand tucked tight in his own. He saw the question in the boy's eyes, a reflection of the question that gnawed at him too. Was their love, their bond, less valid because it didn't fit the mold? Was it less worthy of protection, of the simple dignity that came with a legal name, a shared future?\n\n\"We'll be warm,\" he finally said, his voice rough with the dust of the road. It was a promise whispered on the wind, a prayer for a dawn that might bring not just warmth, but understanding.",
            "The boy spoke. Said it was wrong. To keep something locked away just ‘cause it was forbidden. Like some kind of sin.  \n\nHe’d seen it in the pharmacy. The vials. The bottles. Rows and rows of things that could cure and solace and hurt. Things the law said were good and things it said were bad. But the line was thin.  \n\n“Just because they say ‘no’ doesn’t mean it ain’t right,” the boy said.\n\nHe thought about it. The boy was young, eyes still bright with a kind of innocence. But he knew the weight of a bottle. The power held in a single pill.\n\n“There are things that help,” he said. “Doctors use ‘em. But some are dangerous. Some are meant for people in need, not for just anyone.”\n\nThe boy frowned. “But what if the need ain’t for a doctor?”\n\nHe stopped. Didn’t know how to answer that. \n\nHe knew the boy was talking about the herb. The green smoke that curled in the night, the smell that lingered in the air. He’d seen the way it calmed the old man, the way it eased the pain in his mother’s bones. \n\nHe’d seen the way it made people forget.\n\n“It’s a slippery slope,” he said finally. “One step here, another there. Before you know it, you’re drowning in darkness.”\n\nThe boy shook his head. “Maybe the darkness is what they’re afraid of.”",
            "The church, it’s changed. Not the way you might think, not with some grand upheaval or revolution. More like the slow, patient rot of an old thing, crumbling from the inside out. When I was a girl, Sundays meant lace and silk, little shoes that pinched and purses that clutched a rosary. We’d all be there, God’s finest, in the pews, faces solemn, voices hushed. Now?  Jeans and khakis. Flip-flops in the summer. Families rushing in, hair tangled, kids whining. They call it \"teen mass,\" a quick thirty minutes to get it over with. \n\nPeople talk about the scandals, the darkness at the heart.  They say maybe things would be different if there were women priests, if the men could walk with wives by their side. But what good are rules against the devil in a man’s heart? There are married men who do bad things. It ain't tied to the collar or the vow of celibacy. It's something deeper, something dark and twisted. \n\nThey say you can’t hide something like that, that it’ll come out. Maybe. Or maybe it’ll fester, hidden away like a wound that never heals. Maybe the church, like the world, is just a place where darkness dwells, waiting for its chance.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of a broken world. He'd seen it all before, the lies, the blood, the ash settling like a shroud. September's grief, a raw wound still bleeding.  They'd been told of a monster, a phantom threat, a devil in the desert. A puppet master pulling strings, a hand reaching for the heavens.  But the monster, it turned out, wasn't a man. It was the lie itself, a serpent coiled in the heart of power, its venom seeping into the bones of the nation.\n\nHe remembered the words, the man in the uniform, his voice a rasping echo in the suffocating air. Weapons of mass destruction.  A threat to freedom. A just cause. Lies spun from the same thread as the smoke rising from the ruins of a city devoured by fire.\n\nPowell, the general, his face etched with the weariness of a man who'd seen too much, too late. He'd stood before the world, a salesman peddling a poisoned truth. Now, even he admitted the charade, the faintest whisper of regret in his voice.\n\nMalfeasance. Impeachment. Empty words against the tide of blood. A disregard for the Constitution, a casual dismantling of the very foundations of their world. The twilight of democracy, a slow, agonizing descent into darkness.\n\nHe thought of the young men, sent to fight a phantom, their dreams swallowed by the desert sand.  Their mothers, their fathers, their sisters, their wives, left to pick up the pieces of shattered lives.  \n\nThe war, a festering wound, oozing its poison into the world. A brutal, senseless conflict, fueled by greed and fear. The echo of gunfire, the distant screams, a symphony of destruction.\n\nAnd now, a fragile peace, a patchwork of alliances stitched together with threads of hope and despair. A government teetering on the brink, a nation fractured and bleeding. The old man shook his head, a silent lament for a world gone astray.",
            "The air was thick with dust, the silence broken only by the rasp of wind across the cracked earth. He spoke in a low voice, a monotone born of weary acceptance. \"It don't feel right, this whole affair. Like a fever dream, chasing shadows.\"  \n\nHe paused, his gaze distant, lost in the ash-choked horizon. \"They say it's about justice, about payback for what happened. But it's more like a hunger, a need to prove something, to stick it to them.\"\n\nHis words were tight, measured, like stones dropped into a well. \"They say it's about democracy, about bringing light to a dark place. But the light ain't taking hold, just burnin' away what little's left.\" \n\nHe ran a hand through his hair, the gesture tired, defeated. \"It's like we're tryin' to build a church on a foundation of dust. The wind just blows it all away.\"\n\nA bitterness laced his voice. \"They say it's about oil, about security. But the oil's black gold, and the security's a fleeting thing. The only thing real are the dead, the ones who don't come home.\"\n\nHe looked at the sun, a pale disc in the gray sky, and spat. \"I don't know what the answer is, what the point is anymore. It just feels like a slow, grinding death, for everyone involved.\"\n\nHe fell silent, the words hanging heavy in the dust-filled air.",
            "The road stretched on, gray and broken, coated in the ash of some long-gone fire.  He knew the boy wouldn't understand the words, wouldn't grasp the weight of them, but he'd say them anyway. \"Separation of church and state,\" he'd murmur, the words tasting like dust in his mouth. \"Writ large in the book, right there in black and white.\"\n\nThe boy, he was young, eyes still bright with the light of innocence.  He wouldn't see the darkness that clung to these things, the shadows that stretched long and silent over the land.  How could he? He saw only the world as it was, the sun beating down on the cracked earth, the wind whispering through the skeletal remains of trees.\n\nBut the man, he saw the ghosts. He saw the hands reaching from the ground, clawing at the sky. He saw the faces in the ash, etched with the pain of a world gone mad. He saw the hunger in the eyes of men, the endless hunger for power, for control.\n\nAnd he knew, deep in the bone, that this push for a new law, this attempt to bind the church and the state together, it was a seed of that hunger. It was a step closer to the abyss.\n\n\"They want to take away our freedom,\" he'd tell the boy, his voice rough with the grit of the road. \"They want to tell us what to think, what to believe. But the book, the book says different. It says we have a right to our own faith.\"\n\nHe knew the boy wouldn't understand all the words, but he'd feel the weight of them. He'd feel the fear, the desperation that gnawed at the man's soul.  And in that shared fear, in that silent communion, they would find a kind of solace. A fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, the darkness wouldn't win.",
            "The dust settled on the cracked asphalt. A silence hung over the ruins of what had once been a city, thick as the ash that choked the air. It was the kind of silence that pressed in on a man, a silence that spoke of things long gone and things never to be. He didn't know if he'd ever seen the sun in its full light again, not since the world had turned to ash.\n\nHe kept the pistol close. Always close. The boy walked beside him, his face pale beneath the grime, his eyes wide and watchful. They were moving south, toward a country that promised nothing but more dust and more silence. He didn't know if there was anything left worth finding, but he kept walking, driven by a whisper, a promise of something beyond the endless gray.\n\n\"What happened here?\" the boy asked, his voice small and thin against the wind.\n\n\"The world forgets,\" he said, his voice a rough rasp. \"It's hard to remember what it was like before.\" He looked at the boy, his eyes shadowed. \"Before the fire.\"\n\nThey moved through the skeletal remains of buildings, past twisted metal and shattered glass. The air was thick with the smell of decay and the bitter tang of dust. He stopped at a boarded-up storefront, its windows cracked and vacant.\n\n\"What was this place?\"\n\n\"A store,\" he said, his gaze drifting to a faded sign that hung precariously from the wall. \"They sold things people wanted.\"\n\nThe boy frowned. \"What kind of things?\"\n\nHe couldn't answer. He didn't remember. He could only feel the weight of the silence, the emptiness that stretched before them like a vast, unending desert.\n\nThey continued on, their footsteps echoing in the stillness. The boy walked on, his small hand clutching his father's. He didn't question anymore. He had learned to hold onto the hand that held him, to trust the silence that surrounded them.",
            "The air hung thick with it, this business of love. A man and a man, a woman and a woman, he’d seen them all.  He’d seen them in the shadows, eyes locked like hunted things. He’d seen them in the light, hands intertwined, a quiet defiance in their gaze.  Love, he thought, a word worn thin by the world.  A word that carried the weight of judgment, of fear.  But in the end, it was just a thing, a pull, a fire that burned in the belly. \n\nHe’d seen it in the faces of children, too, a innocence he couldn’t remember. A boy with his arm around another boy, a girl with her head on a girl’s shoulder.  The same look he’d seen in his own father’s eyes, years ago, on a day the world had felt different, maybe even hopeful.\n\nHe knew the world tried to cage it, this love, to teach it a place in the shadows. To say it was wrong, unnatural.  But the man knew better. He’d seen the world unravel, seen the darkness creep in.  He’d seen the laws laid down, the lines drawn. But love, that fire, it wouldn’t be tamed. It burned on, a defiant spark in the growing gloom.\n\nHe’d seen it in the eyes of those who clung to the old ways, the fear, the anger.  A fear of what they didn't understand, a hatred born of ignorance.  But the man saw the truth: love was the only thing strong enough to fight the darkness.  It was the only thing worth fighting for.",
            "The words hang in the air, frail and echoing. A public forum, he says.  The net, a sprawling web, casting its shadow over every act, every thought.  You put it out there, and it sticks. A stain on the soul of the world.  He speaks of shootings, of violence, the kind that stains the air thick and heavy.  Someone will hear, someone will see.  The school, forced to act, to protect, to police the dreams of the young.  A whisper, a rumour, a joke skewed in the harsh light of day.  An experiment gone wrong, a sociology lesson turned chilling.  He remembers, remembers the boy, the boy's laughter in the face of a storm. On Facebook, on Myspace, words bleed into the void.  There is no privacy, no sanctuary.  The past, the future, all flattened by the cold eye of the screen.  The school, a fortress under siege, forced to sift through the digital detritus, searching for the spark, the flicker of danger.  He speaks of invasion, of boundaries breached, of the teacher’s gaze, predatory and unwelcome, lurking in the shadows of the internet.  But the words fall flat, hollow.  For in the digital world, there is no sanctuary, no hidden corner where secrets can lie undisturbed.   The internet, a judge, jury, and executioner, passes its sentence on everyone.",
            "The war, it stretches on. A wound that festers. The purpose, once clear, now a dim memory. A ghost of something good, something righteous. But the years have bled it dry. Left us chasing shadows. Proving something, to whom? To ourselves? A hollow victory, a pyrrhic cost.\n\nHe remembers the talk at the start. Democracy, a righteous cause. A hand outstretched to lift a people from tyranny. But somewhere along the line, the whispers turned to shouts. The motives, once veiled in patriotism, now nakedly exposed. The past, a tangled skein of oil fields and family feuds, cast a long, dark shadow over the present.\n\nThis land, this ravaged land, it bears the weight of it all.  The ghosts of fallen soldiers, the hollow eyes of refugees. The stench of dust and death hangs heavy in the air.\n\nIs this what they fought for? This endless, grinding conflict? Once, there was a purpose. Now, there's only the echo of it, a fading drumbeat in the desert wind.\n\nHe sees the faces of the dead, the broken bodies, the shattered dreams. He feels the weight of the world on his shoulders, the burden of a war that never ends.\n\nHe thinks of his own children, their laughter a distant memory. Their futures stolen by a conflict that has consumed everything. He wonders if they will ever know peace.\n\nHe wonders if he will.",
            "The question hung in the air, a moth caught in the dust motes of the room. \n\n\"Uh,\" she began, voice thin as a whisper. \"It was stopped, see, 'cause someone found it online.\"\n\nHe leaned back, the worn wood of the chair groaning beneath him. \"Mmm.\"\n\n\"Online? But Myspace...\" she hesitated, the words catching on her tongue. \"It's, well, it's supposed to be private, isn't it? You have to be friends.\"\n\n\"Friends,\" he echoed, the sound a hollow drumbeat in the silence. \"But isn't that what gives them permission? To see?\"\n\n\"I guess,\" she mumbled, picking at a loose thread on her sleeve. \"It's like, if you put it out there...\"\n\n\"You give it over,\" he finished, his voice a low rumble.\n\nA silence fell, thick and heavy as the dust that coated everything.\n\n\"But what if it was good,\" she finally said, her voice barely audible. \"What if someone saw it, and it meant saving a life?\"\n\n\"Tough,\" he said, the word a stone dropped in the stillness. \"You can't have some soul policing every profile, watching for trouble.\"\n\n\"But...\" she started, then stopped, her face pale and drawn. \"It's like, what if they were just looking, accidentally?\"\n\n\"Accidentally,\" he repeated, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. \"Or looking for something, a sign... \"\n\nHe trailed off, his eyes distant, seeing something beyond the chipped paint on the walls, something dark and terrible.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" he said finally, his voice a rasp, \"what you put out there... it finds its way back.\"",
            "The boy sat with a crumpled pack of cigarettes in his hand, staring at the dust motes dancing in the light filtering through the cracked windowpane. \"It's all gone to shit, ain't it?\" he rasped, the words rattling in his chest like loose gravel.\n\n\"You think?\" The man, his face a roadmap of wrinkles etched by sun and worry, didn't look up from the worn photograph he clutched in his calloused hand. A faded image of a woman with eyes the color of a storm-tossed sea and a smile that promised a warmth long gone.\n\n\"Yeah. I mean, what was it all for?\" The boy stubbed out the cigarette on the floor, the glowing ember a fleeting defiance in the gloom. \"They said it'd be different. Said we'd bring freedom, democracy, all that shit. But it's just... ash.\"\n\nThe man nodded, the photograph clutched tight. \"They always say that. But the only thing they bring is dust and bone.\"\n\nSilence settled in the room, heavy and thick like the smoke that hung in the air. Outside, the wind howled like a wounded animal, whipping the dust into frenzied dances. \n\n\"I hate it,\" the boy whispered, his voice barely audible above the wind. \"I hate this place, this world. I hate that I might die here, with nothing but ash for company.\"\n\nThe man placed the photograph down on a dusty table, his eyes distant, lost in a memory that burned brighter than the dying embers of the world. \"There's always somewhere else,\" he said, his voice a brittle whisper. \"Somewhere beyond the dust, beyond the ash. There's always hope.\"\n\nThe boy looked at him, his eyes filled with a weariness that belied his years. \"Hope?\" he scoffed. \"Hope's a luxury we can't afford.\" \n\nThe man reached out, his hand rough and calloused, and placed it on the boy's shoulder. \"No,\" he said, his voice firm despite the tremors that shook his body. \"Hope is the only thing we have left.\"",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of it all.  The wind, it rasped and sighed through the skeletal trees, carrying the grit of broken things.  Yeah, he felt it. The discrimination.  Cut deep, like a bone-knife. Not just for the women, though they bore the brunt.  A sickness in the marrow, the way the world saw things.\n\nHe thought of the women, trapped behind the glass roof, invisible to the men above.  Qualified, but never chosen.  Their dreams choked by the dust of history.  And the men, hemmed in too, by expectations like iron bars.  The stay-at-home dads, their hands calloused not from labor but from yearning,  looked upon with suspicion, their souls branded as lesser.\n\nThen there was the fashion, a world of brittle beauty where men who dared to dream in silks and satins were met with scorn.  \"Don't tell me about fashion, son,\" they'd sneer, \"you don't know the first thing about a woman's heart.\"  They were blind, these men, to the subtle whispers of style, the language of cloth and thread.\n\nIt was a slow burn, this injustice.  A fire smoldering under the ashes of a world that refused to see.  Change, it was a hard thing to come by.  But maybe, just maybe, a seed of understanding could take root in the barren soil.  Maybe a whisper of empathy could pierce the thick fog of prejudice.  Maybe, someday, the world would see the men and women beyond the labels, beyond the expectations, and recognize the truth:  that every soul, regardless of gender, yearned for the same things - love, acceptance, and the freedom to be themselves.",
            "The air hung thick with the smoke of things unsaid, of arguments half-remembered. Legalized, they called it. Decriminalized.  A word like cheap tobacco, meant to soothe the rough edges. He knew what it meant though. A ticket, maybe a fine. A blot on the record, a shadow that clung to you like dust. But the boy wouldn't understand. He was young, still wet behind the ears, trusting in the world's promises.\n\nHe thought about the cost, the hollow echoes of it all. The money spent to lock men up, to drag them through the system, to feed them to the maw of the state. And for what? A joint? A puff of smoke? It was a fool's errand, a waste of breath.\n\nDenver, they said. A place with open hearts and open minds. Where the air itself reeked of change, of a willingness to turn the page. But even there,  the taste of it was bitter. Like a promise whispered in the dark, doubted from the start.\n\nHe thought of the lake, the stillness of it, the way the sun bled into the water.  His uncle, weathered and silent, pulling a tree stump from the depths. A day spent in the quiet, the only sound the scrape of oars against wood. A memory, fading like the smell of woodsmoke on the wind.\n\nMarijuana. It wasn't just about the weed itself. It was about control.  About power. About the lines drawn in the sand, the boundaries that separated the haves from the have-nots.\n\nHe looked at the boy, who was still young enough to believe in fairytales. A flicker of something in his eyes, a question he didn't dare voice. He knew those questions would come. The boy would learn, in time, the harsh truths of the world. But for now, he would hold onto the illusions, the fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, things could be better.",
            "The air hung thick with the scent of dust and ash.  A shadow fell across the cracked pavement. \"Yes,\" he said, his voice a rasp. \"Because tradition binds, it holds a man to the earth. Like some ancient root. But the wind changes, and the river bends. To be rooted is to be still, to be vulnerable.\" He paused, his gaze fixed on a distant point beyond the skeletal remains of buildings. \"The weight of it, though. The expectation. It can smother a man. A man has to breathe.\"\n\nHe remembered the cold stone of the church pews, the scent of incense, the weight of the priest's gaze. \"They speak of love, of acceptance. But the church itself is a cage. Small and narrow, with bars of scripture and dogma. They judge those who fall outside the lines, who dare to question.\"  His hand clenched, knuckles white. \"My father, he was different. He sought light in the wrong places. They wouldn't bridge the gap, wouldn't accept his kind. No love there, just judgment.\"\n\nHe looked down at the boy, his eyes reflecting the dust-choked sky. \"They say you must be perfect, but perfection is a lie. A brittle thing, easily shattered. And what of those who stumble? Those who yearn for something more? They are cast out, left to wander in the wilderness of their own doubts.\"\n\nThe boy shifted, his silence a heavy weight. \"They say love is the answer,\" the man continued, his voice a low murmur. \"But love cannot exist without acceptance. Without understanding.  Without the courage to look beyond the surface, beyond the rigid rules, and see the human heart.\"",
            "The line blurred. Where did one stop and the other begin? Church and state. Right and wrong.  Two souls bound, two souls adrift.  It was a knot that twisted tighter with every word spoken, every heart felt. This wasn't some tidy debate. This was the marrow of the matter.  \n\nWas it a sacrament or a contract?  A whispered prayer in a dim church or a line scratched on a government form?  Didn't matter. Didn't it come down to two souls seeking shelter, a haven in the storm? \n\nShould the hand of the state reach into the sanctity of vows?  Or was it a matter of flesh and blood, a union recognized by the very act of joining? \n\nBaptism didn't bring tax breaks, not a single one. It didn't grant a special place at the table.  So why then, was marriage different?  Why this insistence on defining love by the weight of a law?\n\nTwo souls. Two hearts.  A shared breath. Wasn't that enough?  Didn't the government have its own burdens to bear, its own line in the sand to draw?\n\nCivil unions.  That felt closer, more honest.  No pretense, no grand pronouncements. Just two souls saying, \"Here we are.  Here we stand.\"\n\nAnd what of the states?  They clamored for their own truths, their own versions of right and wrong.  But if they could find common ground, wouldn't that be a victory?  \n\nA federal law, a beacon of shared understanding.  But an amendment?  Oh, no.  The Constitution. Sacred. Untouchable.  To sacrifice its sanctity for this?  To enshrine division in its hallowed halls?\n\nIt wasn't right. It wasn't just. It was a wound dug deep into the fabric of the nation.",
            "The air hung thick with the dust of old beliefs, the scent of sulfur and regret.  Homosexuality, it was a thing whispered in the shadows, a question mark etched on the face of the land.  Raised under a roof of hymns and scripture, the notion was a tangled knot in his gut, a discord in the melody of his upbringing. He had friends, yes, souls bound by laughter and shared secrets, their laughter echoing in the hollows of his memories. Friends who walked a path he couldn't quite comprehend, a path paved with whispers and stolen glances.\n\nHe didn't understand it, not truly. But he saw the pain in their eyes, the ache for acceptance, the yearning for a love that mirrored his own. And in that, he saw a reflection of the human need, a longing for connection that transcended the boundaries of the flesh.  \n\nThe law, he felt, should be a shield, not a sword. To impose his vision, his rigid notions, on others, that felt wrong.  States, these microcosms of America, should be the arbiters of their own fate, allowed to shape their own destinies.  After all, wasn't it the right of each soul to choose its own path, to seek its own truth, even if it lay beyond the boundaries of his understanding?\n\nHe thought of the old man, his uncle, weathered and set in his ways, his pipe perpetually clenched between his teeth. A man who believed in the sanctity of tradition, in the unyielding grip of the past. But even the old man, with his stoic silence and unblinking eyes, had a flicker of humanity in his gaze, a recognition of the inherent worth of every human being.\n\nHe wished he could offer more, a clearer answer, a solution that would mend the fractured heart of the nation. But all he had were these fragments of thought, these whispered echoes in the vast emptiness of uncertainty.  \n\nFor the answers, he knew, lay not in the pronouncements of men, but in the quiet spaces between the lines, in the shared humanity that bound them all together, despite their differences.",
            "The boy shuffled closer, his breath a thin mist in the cold.  \"They're watching us,\" he said, eyes narrowed.  His voice was a rasp, like dry leaves skittering on pavement.\n\n\"They're always watching,\" the man said, his gaze fixed on the bleached horizon. The world was a canvas of ash, the sky a pale, bruised thing.  \"But they can't see everything.\"\n\nThe boy's face, gaunt and pale, was etched with worry. \"What if they find us?\"\n\nThe man tightened his grip on the rusted pistol tucked into his belt. \"Then we'll walk on.\"\n\nThey had been moving south for weeks, their path a jagged scar across the barren landscape.  The boy didn't ask questions anymore. He just walked, his small hand clutching the man's, his gaze fixed on the road ahead.  They lived in the silence of the road, the whisper of the wind through the skeletal trees, the rasp of their own breaths.\n\nHe remembered a time before. A time of warmth and light, of laughter and the smell of rain on dry earth.  But that time was gone, swallowed by the ash and the silence. Now, the world was a wasteland, a testament to some forgotten apocalypse.\n\nThey had found the city by chance, a skeletal monument to a vanished world. Buildings rose like broken teeth against the gray sky, windows empty sockets staring out at the desolation.  There was nothing left inside, only dust and the ghosts of memories.\n\nHe had stopped the boy from going inside. \"Remember what I told you,\" he had said, his voice a low growl. \"Don't touch anything. Don't look too closely.\"\n\nThe boy had nodded, eyes wide and wary.\n\nThey had found shelter in a ruined church, its stained-glass windows shattered, its walls scarred with graffiti.  The air was thick with the smell of decay, but it was a dry, brittle decay, like the husk of something long dead.\n\nThe boy slept restlessly, his nightmares echoing in the silence. The man sat beside him, hand resting on the boy's shoulder, a silent promise.  He would protect him.  He would keep him safe.\n\nHe would keep the darkness at bay.",
            "The dust of it all. War. The way it clung to him, a memory the color of ash. At first, the fires of September had burned bright in his gut, a need for retribution. To strike back against that darkness, to repay in kind. Like a fevered dream, the thought of it had seemed clear, righteous. To go over and make them pay. \n\nBut now, the embers had cooled. The heat had turned to a hollow ache. He saw the flaws in the plan, the cracks in the foundation. They’d gone in blind, driven by rage, unprepared for the tangled roots of the place. A tangled mess of history and hate, a land where men fought not for ideals but for scraps, for survival.\n\nHe thought about the faces, the eyes that stared back from the dust-choked streets. How could they understand? How could they be understood? They were caught in a cycle, a endless loop of violence. Us against them, them against us. He couldn’t reach them, couldn’t offer them anything but more of the same.\n\nIt wasn't their fault, he realized. Not entirely. But it wasn't his fault either. He'd been a pawn, a cog in a machine that had ground them all down. And now, the machine kept turning, fueled by anger and fear. \n\nHe looked out at the horizon, a vast emptiness under the sun-bleached sky. What was the point? What had they achieved? He didn't know. He only knew that the war had taken something from him, something he couldn't get back. He saw a flicker of ash in the wind, a ghost of the fires that had consumed so much.\n\nHe turned away, the weight of it all pressing down on his chest.  It was time to walk away. Leave the dust and the ashes behind. \n\nHe had to. For himself."
